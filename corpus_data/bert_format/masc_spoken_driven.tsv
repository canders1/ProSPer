And I've done that. [SEP] Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues. [SEP] I've reached across the aisle. [SEP] I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans. [SEP] And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically	driven	efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together. [SEP] And one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	drive	written	masc_spoken	5
