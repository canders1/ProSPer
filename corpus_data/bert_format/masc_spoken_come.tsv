The Second Gore-Bush Presidential Debate Let's wel	come	the candidates, Governor Bush and Vice President Gore. [SEP] Good evening, from Wake Chapel at Wake Forest University at Winston-Salem, North Carolina. [SEP] I'm Jim Lehrer of the News Hour on PBS. [SEP] Wel	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
A humble nation. [SEP] I agree with that. I agree with that. [SEP] I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway. [SEP] That there is some resentment of U.S. power. [SEP] So I think that the idea of humility is an important one. [SEP] But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world. [SEP] We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about. [SEP] That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong. [SEP] You know, in the last, or two decades ago it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to	come	over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time. [SEP] The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough. [SEP] We need to do more. [SEP] But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent. [SEP] Does that give us -- does our wealth, our good economy, our power, bring with it special obligations to the rest of the world?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
go further. [SEP] I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it, but that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. [SEP] I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have	come	in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it. [SEP] I don't think they should be allowed to. [SEP] Did he state your position correctly, you're not calling for eliminating the sanctions, are you?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	5
I do, I do. [SEP] The Persian Gulf, obviously. [SEP] And Bosnia. [SEP] And you have already talked about Kosovo. [SEP] But the reverse side of the question, Governor, that Vice President Gore mentioned, 600,000 people died in Rwanda in 1994. [SEP] There was no U.S. intervention, no intervention from the outside world. [SEP] Was that a mistake not to intervene? [SEP] I think the administration did the right thing in that case. [SEP] I do. [SEP] It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda. [SEP] And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa	come	together and help deal with the situation. [SEP] The administration, seem like we're having a great love for us tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda. [SEP] Do you have any second thoughts on that, based on what you said a moment ago about genocide?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	5
Do you have any second thoughts on that, based on what you said a moment ago about genocide? [SEP] I'd like to	come	back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first. [SEP] Fine. [SEP] We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. [SEP] My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. [SEP] But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there. [SEP] We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. [SEP] But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim. [SEP] One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can reall	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
So what would you say, Governor, that somebody would say hey wait a minute, why not Africa, I mean why the Middle East, why the Balkans, but not Africa, when 600,000 people's lives are at risk? [SEP] Well, I understand, and Africa is important. [SEP] And we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some -- Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy. [SEP] We have to work with Nigeria. [SEP] That's an important continent. [SEP] But there's got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere. [SEP] And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to	come	together to prevent atrocity. [SEP] I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide. [SEP] I thought that was a good model. [SEP] But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim. [SEP] And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences. [SEP] I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world. [SEP] I want to be judicious in its use. [SEP] You mentioned Haiti. [SEP] I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti. [SEP] I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile. [SEP] It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful. [SEP] It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I'm not so sure democracy is any bet	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
 leaders and the people of the United States. [SEP] The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. [SEP] And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. [SEP] We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there. [SEP] We still have lots of troops in Europe. [SEP] And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's? [SEP] We were nation building. [SEP] And it was economic. [SEP] But it was also military. [SEP] And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there. [SEP] We had civil administrators	come	in to set up their ways of building their towns back. [SEP] You said in the Boston debate, Governor, on this issue of nation building, that the United States military is overextended now. [SEP] Where is it overextended? [SEP] Where are there U.S. military that you would bring home if you be	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	5
stability. [SEP] And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military. [SEP] It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious. [SEP] I don't disagree with that. [SEP] I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete. [SEP] That's what we did in Haiti. [SEP] There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now. [SEP] And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy. [SEP] That's really about all we can do. [SEP] But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to	come	across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there. [SEP] And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose. [SEP] And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended. [SEP] I certainly agree with that. [SEP] And that's why I've supported building up our capacity. [SEP] I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed. [SEP] I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does. [SEP] We've had some disagreements about that. [SEP] He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say. [SEP] But there's no doubt that we have to c	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
k that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF. [SEP] The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. [SEP] The governor mentioned it earlier. [SEP] I've worked on this issue. [SEP] It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it. [SEP] And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it. [SEP] I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history. [SEP] The world has	come	together, as I said, they're looking to us. [SEP] And we have a fundamental choice to make. [SEP] Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader. [SEP] And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years. [SEP] I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. [SEP] Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus. [SEP] It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds 	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	5
New subject, new question, Vice President Gore. [SEP] How do you see the connection between controlling gun sales in this country and the incidence of death by accidental or intentional use of guns? [SEP] Jim, I hope that we can	come	back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed. [SEP] But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned. [SEP] I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. [SEP] I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. [SEP] The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns. [SEP] I think these assault weapons are a problem. [SEP] So I favor closing the gun sh	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
icials need help at the federal level. [SEP] Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. [SEP] And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. [SEP] And I'm going to make it a priority. [SEP] Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them. [SEP] That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows. [SEP] One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. [SEP] In Texas I tried to do something innovative. [SEP] There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. [SEP] I support that. [SEP] But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe,	come	and get one for free. [SEP] So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free. [SEP] I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. [SEP] I disagree with the vice president on this issue. [SEP] He is for registration of guns. [SEP] I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens. [SEP] The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D. card. [SEP] It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that. [SEP] An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe. [SEP] All right. [SEP] So on guns, somebody wants to cast a vote based on your differences	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
Governor, did the -- are the vice president's figures correct about Texas? [SEP] First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system? [SEP] I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system. [SEP] It was fortunately stopped in its tracks. [SEP] Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas. [SEP] Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up. [SEP] Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President. [SEP] It may	come	as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long. [SEP] But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union. [SEP] And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999. [SEP] We've signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program. [SEP] For comparable states our size, we're signing them up as fast as any other state. [SEP] You can quote all the numbers you want, but I'm telling you we care about our people in Texas. [SEP] We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and we're doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured. [SEP] Is he right?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
t the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population. [SEP] And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd. [SEP] Let me just tell you who the jury is. [SEP] The people of Texas. [SEP] There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me. [SEP] And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person. [SEP] So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around. [SEP] I'm just telling you our state	come	s together to do what is right. [SEP] We	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
99 to nothing. [SEP] Well, that vote wasn't exactly -- a lot of the supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded. But there's no doubt there's a lot of opposition to it in the Senate. I'm not for command and control techniques either. I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves	come	up with. But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming. I think that we do. It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this. Look, the world's temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable. What are we going to tell our children? I'm a grandfather now. I want to be able to tell my grandson when I'm in my later years that I didn't turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm. In my faith tradition, it is -- it's written in the book of Matthew, "Where your heart is, there is your treasure also."

I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. [SEP] And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be. [SEP] The measurement is not: Are we safer? [SEP] The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be? [SEP] And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected. [SEP] Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent	come	in today uninspected. [SEP] That's not good enough. [SEP] People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is. [SEP] That's not good enough. [SEP] Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them.

[SEP] We got to have health care for all Americans.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees. [SEP] And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent. [SEP] Now, the president has never explained to America, ever, hasn't done it tonight, where does the transitional money, that $2 trillion,	come	from? [SEP] He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for. [SEP] Not one of them are paid for.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
And we'll continue to do so over the next four years. [SEP] It's a subject I'm very familiar with. [SEP] After all, I was a border governor for a while. [SEP] Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons. [SEP] They're coming here to work. [SEP] If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5. [SEP] 15, you're going to	come	here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families. [SEP] And that's what's happening. [SEP] And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
Senator? [SEP] Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll	come	to immigration. [SEP] The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob. [SEP] And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces. [SEP] Our military is overextended. [SEP] Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have	come	back from Iraq. [SEP] One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it. [SEP] Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	5
I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, "See the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. " Because of the president's decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous. [SEP] Terrorists can now	come	into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today. [SEP] And that's what Osama bin Laden's handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan. [SEP] It encouraged them to do it.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
I think we've got a lot more work to do. [SEP] And as president, I will always respect everybody's right to practice religion as they choose -- or not to practice -- because that's part of America. [SEP] Senator Kerry, after 9/11 -- and this is a new question for you -- it seemed to me that the country came together as I've never seen it	come	together since World War II. [SEP] But some of that seems to have melted away. [SEP] I think it's fair to say we've be	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	5
That's not where we are today. [SEP] I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country. [SEP] I've never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States. [SEP] I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today. [SEP] We have to change that. [SEP] And as president, I am committed to changing that. [SEP] I don't care if the idea	come	s from the other side or this side. [SEP] I think we have to	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	1
He said, "Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain. It's the sunrise side, not the sunset side. It's the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. " I love the optimism in that painting, because that's how I feel about America. [SEP] And we've been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years. [SEP] We've	come	through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country. [SEP] And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing. [SEP] Over the next four years, we'll make sure the economy continues to grow.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	5
Just anything to get out of doing my job. [SEP] So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow, do what she tell told me to do, she asked me to	come	around in the living room with her and the rest of the family.

Once upon a time there was this little girl and her family. [SEP] And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not	come	up, wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table. [SEP] And her little girl just complained, "I don't want to wash the dishes.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	1

So I had to, I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill.

Or Go-there. [SEP] A lot of people ask that, if they actually just wanna  go  there. [SEP] People	come	up to you on campus and say, "Where's the library?" [SEP] You're gonna say - y- you're gonna say, g- "Go down  that  way."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	1
