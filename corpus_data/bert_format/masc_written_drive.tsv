which, during the day, keeps a person from feeling increasingly sleepy. [SEP] An hour or two before bedtime, this signal subsides, and s/he realizes it's time to hit the pillow.

Motors Antie’s motors will allow it to move around and interact with its environment and fellow ants. [SEP] There will be two individually operated motors to	drive	the two side wheels in lieu of legs. [SEP] Two simultaneously operated motors will open and close the grippers, emulating the grasping power of the ant’s mandibles. [SEP] A third motor will lift and lower the grippers, allowing Antie to raise and lower gripped items as an ant would by raising and lowering its head. [SEP] Three small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from the appropriate sacs. [SEP] These will be located in different places: the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie, corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths, while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the sk	#essays#	essays_Ant_Robot.txt	drive	written	masc_written	1
 in Example 19, the first chord is an F-major chord, and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody. In fact, the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as I-vi-V in F major—while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major (the conspicuous A♭ in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation), we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation. [SEP] In addition to the “mode”-shift, we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears (notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19) and also that the written meter no longer changes. [SEP] In other words, the piece, in becoming more regular, is beginning to	drive	towards the finish—because of the formal structure, the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement. [SEP] Indeed, this section has the feel of a Coda to it—it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection, and the tonic harmony is active throughout. [SEP] There are also no phrase divisions—the music simply	#essays#	essays_Bartok.txt	drive	written	masc_written	1

 and called the police. [SEP] “I need to file a missing persons report. …Rachel Frieze. Last night, walking on West 2nd street around – maybe eleven or twelve o’clock. What? …But, sir, this is an unusual situation. She didn’t come home last night, none of her friends have seen her. …Sir, if she’s in any danger, it will probably be too late to help her by that time. My girlfriend has disappeared, I don’t even know where to start looking, and I need help! …Yes, sir. I understand.” [SEP] The police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight. [SEP] I closed the phone. [SEP] Walking out of the church, a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise. [SEP] A cold front must have hit while I was inside. [SEP] Glancing down the street, I realized that I didn’t have a friend to	drive	me home this time, and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran. [SEP] I pulled my T-shirt’s sleeves down my arms as far as they’d go, but I wasn’t ready for cold. [SEP] Walking didn’t build up much heat; it just moved the air enough to chill me more. [SEP] After I’d walked about a block, a car rolled up behind me. [SEP] It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry. [SEP] This wasn’t the best of neighborhoods.

 I just barely had it open before I saw the vampire again, turning to face me. I pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes. [SEP] He leapt over the pews, soaring like a grasshopper, and drew a gleaming knife in midair. [SEP] I dodged, but he tossed it, and I held the box in front of my face. [SEP] The blade lodged in the wood, its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin. [SEP] My arms shook from the force of his throw. [SEP] Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand. [SEP] His first move pulled out the dagger, almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box, and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards. [SEP] I dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer, ready to	drive	the ash spike into his heart. [SEP] Behind him, I saw Nepthys running between the pews. [SEP] I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me. I raised the stake; he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine. [SEP] The stake went down, there was a blur, and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw. [SEP] Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant, then all went numb. [SEP] Taste, hearing and touch became a single blur, and I do not know if my eyes were open. [SEP] My mind began to dissipate, but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said, “This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking.” [SEP] Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack.	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	drive	written	masc_written	1

[SEP] Allan hung his head, holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees. [SEP] His hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night, and his clothing had a rumpled look as if, by mere proximity, it had taken on the aspect of his weariness. [SEP] He scratched the back of his dark-haloed head and blinked bleary eyes. [SEP] "I would	drive	it out," he said softly, "but I fear for what would remain."

this mixture as agency and communion. [SEP] At a very basic level agency is about control and communion is about co-operation. [SEP] Agency is individualistic, and characterised by autonomy, independence, initiative, and adaptation. [SEP] It is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people are ultimately responsible for their own development. [SEP] Communion, in contrast to agency, is concerned about connections, relationships, tolerance, and trust. [SEP] It is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people need to manage their own arrangements for working with others.1 [SEP] In ‘weak’ environments, in which rules are not defined and behavioural responses not controlled, both agency and communion are means by which people respond to uncertainty. [SEP] Agency provides direction and	drive	to career behaviour and helps to diffuse ambiguity by providing vision and long-term goals. [SEP] Left to its own means, however, agency may cause strong hierarchies to reform, the balance of power to be lost, and, most importantly, the trust and co-operation necessary for people and information to move across boundaries to be forfeited. [SEP] Communion provides the platform for mutual support and collective learning through which shared visions may be pursued. [SEP] However, unbridled communion may neglect to attend to the mechanisms and rewards through which effective collaboration can occur. [SEP] The Silicon Valley and independent film-making examples illustrate the interplay of agency and communion.
