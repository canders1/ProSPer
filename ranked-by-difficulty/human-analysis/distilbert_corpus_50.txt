Sentence: The historical retreat to the Declaration of Independence left Lincoln with a major paradox. He claims to be speaking as president, and his office owed its existence to Article II of the Constitution of 1787. Yet, he thought himself back prior to the Philadelphia convention and the creation of the presidency. He pulled the rug of legitimacy out from under his own office. To be able to advocate the principle that all men are created equal, that a nation was born committed to this principle, he had to speak from a time prior to the creation of the government for which the Union troops died.<n>The precursor to this unusual mode of dating comes in an unexpected place—in the final paragraph of the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863:<n>Done at the City of Washington, this first day of<n>

Sentence: Mojado (Wetback)<n>A translation of the word “wetback,” sometimes spelled moja’o, which literally simply means “wet.” It is a pejorative expression, although it is sometimes used by Mexican people to describe themselves and their experience of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to come to the United States. Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos, with the same prejudicial meaning as “greaser” or “spic.” Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants. Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called “wets.”<n>Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels.

In 1955 a well--established Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas, which intended to persuade Mexicans not to go to the United States. It was a political film that incorporated all of the standard characters that would appear in countless other films and novels of the Chicano experience: the wetback, the pocho (half Mexican), the coyote (smuggler) who smuggles people into the United States, and the grower Mister Sterling. An ironic, yet justified ending shows Mister Sterling dumped into the Rio Grande by Mexicans, and as he swims to the U.S. side of the border he is shot by the Border Patrol. In a 1998 article Herrera-Sobek discusses the use of corridos in several Mexican films that depict the plight of the illegal immigrant, or el mojado.<n>References Cordova 1990; Herrera-Sobek 1993b, 1998; Madrid-Barela 1975; Mora 1982<n>
