 Plath’s childhood, stories and storytelling were pervasive. [SEP] As a 2 1/2-year-old, Sylvia was intensely jealous of her sickly younger brother for consuming so much of her mother’s attention. [SEP] While the baby nursed, Sylvia sat nearby on the ﬂoor, impatient and unhappy. [SEP] Her mother discovered that she could defuse Sylvia’s envy with a game in which Sylvia spread out the newspaper before her, picked out all the capital letters on the page, and pretended, in a very grown-up way, to read—an achievement that attracted much parental admiration. [SEP] Sylvia’s mother often made up bedtime tales, serialized from one evening to the next. [SEP] Almost as soon as they could talk, Sylvia and her brother responded in kind with limericks, poems, and fantastic stories of their own. [SEP] On	walks	to their grandparents’ house and on long car trips, favorite books invariably came along, offering ready inspiration for the children’s imaginative creations.54 [SEP] Filmstar Charlie Chaplin’s mother was herself a talented comedy actress and singer. [SEP] As a young child, Charlie often accompanied her when she went to work at the theater. [SEP] As a result, playacting and impersonating became an early focus of Charlie’s pretending. [SEP] One evening during a performance, his mother’s voice failed. [SEP] In a pinch, the stage manager, who had seen Charlie at play, led the little boy onstage in her place. [SEP] Charlie continued his playacting unabated, which included songs, dances, and impersonations from his mother’s repertoire.

Adivinanzas (Riddles) Adivinanzas are riddles. [SEP] Many Chicano children remember being entertained with riddles narrated by parents and grandparents. [SEP] A riddle is an intellectual brainteaser, in Spanish called a quebracabeza; facts are framed in the form of a question in such a way that the respondent cannot possibly know the answer. [SEP] An example in Spanish is, “Qué camina de cuatro patas por la mañana, dos patas en el medio día, y tres patas en la noche?” (What	walks	on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night?) The answer is man, who as a child, in the “morning” of life, crawls on four legs; as an adult	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	4
When K is the maximum value, N - , as in Figure .a–c, then each gene influences the fitness contribution of every gene. [SEP] This is the totally interconnected system. [SEP] Since fitness values are assigned at random for the to the (K + ), or to the N input configurations when K = N - , it is easy to show that the resulting fitness landscape is fully random. [SEP] A main feature of random landscapes is that there are nearly exponentially many local peaks, indeed the number of local peaks is to N/(N + ). [SEP] For N = , there are local peaks on the landscape. [SEP] Finding the global peak by hill climbing is improbable, and the system becomes trapped on a local peak. [SEP] Other features include the lengths of	walks	via fitter neighbors to nearby peaks, which scales as the logarithm of N, and the way directions uphill dwindle on	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	4
each organism has traits that are aected by many genes, the polygeny discussed above, and each gene aects many traits, the pleiotropy alluded to above. [SEP] It is interesting to note that were organisms to evolve to a position below but near the biological reality that is the proper analogue of the Ksat phase transition, such a location might well achieve the gradualism and capacity to persistently evolve that Darwin noted and that we observe. [SEP] Both the gradualism and capacity to evolve are related to the number of alternative assignments of true or false to the V variables that satisfy the Ksat normal disjunctive form. [SEP] If there are connected pathways from one such assignment via -Hamming-mutant neighboring assignments that all satisfy the normal disjunctive form, then adaptive	walks	via alternatives genotypes are available, all of which roughly generate the same organism. [SEP] Gradualism is achieved. [SEP] Polygeny and pleiotropy tune landscape ruggedness and deformability, which tune coevolutionary dynamics, perhaps to a self-organized critical state of an ecosystem. [SEP] There are, in short, dimly understood laws that allow the coevolutionary construction of accumulating complexity. [SEP] And it appears that such coevolution typically is self-organized critical. [SEP] The NK coevolutionary model is not the only example of a model exhibiting self-organized critical behavior of model ecosystems. [SEP] Bak and colleagues, Ricard Solé, and others have created elegant models aiming in the same direction.

These two parks lie adjacent to each other, and are usually visited together — one entrance fee covers both. [SEP] The main attractions are their giant sequoias, many of them approaching 3,000 years old, and the spectacular rock scenery of Kings Canyon. [SEP] The forests offer a gorgeous array of dogwoods, sugar pines, and white and red firs, and a rich flora of orange leopard lily, lupine, bracken fern, chinquapin, and white corn lily. [SEP] Start at the Visitor Center at Lodgepole or Grant Grove, where you can pick up a map and information about the best forest	walks	and back-country hikes, and perhaps watch their interesting audio-visual presentations about the parks. [SEP] The best introduction to the forest is Congress Trail. [SEP] It’s an easy 2-mile (3-km) walk, but worth lingering over for a couple of hours to absorb the beauty of the largest living creations in nature. [SEP] The trail begins at the General Sherman Tree, the biggest of them all. [SEP] Measuring 274 ft (84 m) tall, 103 ft (31 m) around its base and still growing, it’s one of the largest living organisms in the world. [SEP] Reaching up for light well above the rest of the forest, the first branches start 130 ft (40 m) above the ground.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	4
Running southwest from the Parc de l’Esplanade, the broad, modern Grande-Allée runs past the Assemblée Nationale (provincial parliament), built from 1877–1886 in the favored style of the time, French Renaissance. [SEP] This has been the citadel of Québec’s quest for a special identity in or outside the Canadian Confederation, especially under Prime Minister René Lévesque. [SEP] On Boulevard St-Cyrille, the Grand Théâtre de Québec was inaugurated in 1971 as Québec City’s arts center and home of the Québec Symphony Orchestra. [SEP] Battlefields Park (Parc des Champs de Bataille, 390 rue de Bernieres) is devoted to the momentous battle on the Plains of Abraham that decided the fate of Québec in 1759. [SEP] Quite apart from its historical significance, the park offers delightful	walks	across the treelined fields. [SEP] In the center of the park you’ll see a massive Martello tower, built in 1805, as part of Québec’s new defenses against a potential American attack. [SEP] In a town where every monument seems like a political statement, rue Wolfe leads to one on the spot where General Wolfe was mortally wounded, while anonymous Québécois patriots have responded with a statue of Joan of Arc, off the Avenue George VI. [SEP] In the southern half of the park, the Musée de Québec possesses a first-rate collection of Québécois painting and sculpture, as well as historic furniture, jewelry, and gold and silver church ornaments. [SEP] The sculpture is principally from the 18th century, but the paintings range from the colony’s beginnings to the present day.

[SEP] On the airport side of town, there are several luxury hotels, and one of these, on the lake itself, is reached by a hand-drawn ferry. [SEP] This is a starting and ending point for trekkers, and as such is filled with a mix of people in anxious anticipation of their impending adventure and those who have recently returned from exhausting treks. [SEP] Everyone seems content to fill up on cakes and pies. [SEP] Day hikes are a popular activity here, with the most popular hike being that to Sarangkot to see Dhaulagiri and the Annapurnas from the viewing tower. [SEP] Other good	walks	include a visit to the Tibetan refugee camp at Tashiling and to the Peace Stupa atop the forested hill on the south side of the lake. [SEP] You can also take a boat out on the lake or walk to Devin’s Fall, where a river disappears underground into a steamy hole. [SEP] While most people look on this as a staging point for a trek, Pokhara is such a beautiful spot that it can be quite enough just to relax and enjoy the mountain scenery in the warm sunshine.
