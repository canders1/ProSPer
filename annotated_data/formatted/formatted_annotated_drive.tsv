The bird handler from the nation's prominent treatment center for wild animals counted to three, giving the group time to pull out their cameras and focus them, and then tossed the eagle up toward the bright blue sky.  To gasps all around, it took the big, strong bird only a few beats of its massive wings to shoot skyward, eventually veering toward the spot where two rangers found it on the ice Dec. 10, after it was injured in a tussle with another eagle.

It's a tall task trying to convince residents that the annoying creatures with bright orange incisors, hunched backs, and long skinny tails belong on the dinner table. Some people are bothered by the orange teeth. But I think what it is -- see, around here, they're so common and they're in our roadside ditches and stuff, and along our highways and byways, that they get run over a lot. They're very slow-moving animals and so you see dead nutria on the roads everywhere you go. I would be willing to wager that if you	drove	around anywhere in the United States and saw dead cows on the side of the road, people would stop eating beef. Road kill aside, wildlife officials say alligator, crawfish, and even red fish were a hard sell at first. Now, they're considered staples of Cajun cuisine.
