reporter's veracity could be questioned each and every time something like this	comes	up. [SEP] I strain mightily not to have to do that. [SEP] That's what I'm talking about. [SEP] Now, I don't know if that clarifies	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	4
 [SEP] But you can't say when you walk into a classroom, you're not teaching. [SEP] And if that's what's happening in the Dover school system and my children are in that school system, that they're routinely establishing practices that is not teaching in the classroom, then that's shameful. [SEP] In addition, I have a child who is in the ninth-grade biology class, and this has spilled over into other classes. [SEP] It's not just the biology class that has been affected by this. [SEP] My child has heard comments from other students, school board member students in her classroom about evolution being against their religion, and do you think we came from monkeys, how can you think we came from monkeys. [SEP] It used to be a weekly occurrence. [SEP] It's now a daily occurrence, and my daughter	comes	home from school upset about these comments that are being made to her and, you know, is looking for guidance on how to respond to these questions. [SEP] Also, intelligent design is not a scientific concept. [SEP] It's a religious concept. [SEP] And because I don't subscribe to that particular brand of religion, I feel that I and my daughter, my family, are being ridiculed, and my daughter feels the pressure. [SEP] I reserve the right to teach my child about religion. [SEP] And I have faith in myself and in my husband and in my pastor to do that, not the school system. [SEP] Thank you. [SEP] No further questions.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	4
And my understanding from your husband's testimony yesterday is that she hasn't yet reached the section in biology that deals with evolution. [SEP] Is that correct? [SEP] Yes. [SEP] After looking at her syllabus, it appears that evolution	comes	later in the course. [SEP] I wouldn't say at the end, but closer to the end of the course. [SEP] And so she hasn't heard this one-minute statement be read in the class yet?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	4
t, it says to educate our students so that they can be contributing members of society. "I do not believe in teaching revisionist history. [SEP] Our country was founded on Christian beliefs and principles. [SEP] We are not looking for a book that is teaching students that this is a wrong thing or a right thing. [SEP] It is just a fact. [SEP] All we are trying to accomplish with this task is to choose a biology book that teaches the most prevalent theories. [SEP] "The definition of 'theory' is merely a speculative or an ideal circumstance. To present only one theory or to give one option would be directly contradicting our mission statement. You can teach creationism without it being Christianity. It can be presented as a higher power. That is where another part of Dover's mission statement	comes	into play. That part would be in partnership with family and community. You as a parent can teach your child your family's ideology."

two minutes. [SEP] The prevailing rule for the audience here in the hall is as always, absolute quiet, please. [SEP] Good evening, Governor Bush, Vice President Gore. [SEP] The end of our 90 minutes last week in Boston, the total time each of you took was virtually the same. [SEP] Let's see if we can do the same tonight, or come close. [SEP] Governor Bush, the first question goes to you. [SEP] One of you is about to be elected the leader of the single-most powerful nation in the world, economically, financially, militarily, diplomatically, you name it. [SEP] Have you formed any guiding principles for exercising this enormous power? [SEP] I have, I have. [SEP] First question is what's in the best interests of the United States? [SEP] What's in the best interests of our people? [SEP] When it	comes	to foreign policy that will be my guiding question. [SEP] Is it in our nation's interests? [SEP] Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests. [SEP] Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests. [SEP] Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest. [SEP] I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president. [SEP] I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy. [SEP] I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. R	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	4
So you don't believe, Vice President Gore, that we should take sides and resolve this right now? [SEP] A lot of people pushing hey, the United States should declare itself and not be so neutral in this particular situation. [SEP] Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker. [SEP] And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue	comes	through us. [SEP] And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel. [SEP] You agree with that, Governor?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	4
You agree with that, Governor? [SEP] I do. [SEP] I do think this, though. [SEP] When it	comes	to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place. [SEP] It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis. [SEP] Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides. [SEP] And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense. [SEP] This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table. [SEP] I will try to do the same thing. [SEP] But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East. [SEP] People watching here tonight are very interested in Middle East policy, and they are so interested they want to base their vote on differences between the two of you as president how you would handle Middle East poli	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	4
 do I advocate an immediate withdrawal. [SEP] That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO. [SEP] No one is suggesting that. [SEP] But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground. [SEP] And there is an example. [SEP] Haiti is another example. [SEP] Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia. I think it's important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world. The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia. But -- The use of the military, there -- some people are now suggesting that if you don't want to use the military to maintain the peace, to do the civil thing, is it time to consider a civil force of some kind that	comes	in after the military that builds nations or all of that? [SEP] Is that on your radar screen? [SEP] I don't think so. [SEP] I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations. [SEP] Maybe I'm missing something here. [SEP] I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America? [SEP] Absolutely not. [SEP] Our military is meant to fight and win war. [SEP] That's what it's meant to do. [SEP] And when it gets overextended, morale drops. [SEP] I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability. [SEP] And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military. [SEP] It needs	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	4
ean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. [SEP] And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. [SEP] And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands. [SEP] Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law. [SEP] Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun	comes	from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun. What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence. So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws. We added beds. We're tough. We believe in tough love. We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained. And that's what needs to happen. We've got laws. If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important. New question. As I was saying. Both of you -- Governor, both of you have talked much about Medicare and health care for seniors. [SEP] What about the more than 40 million younger Americans who do not have health insurance right now? [SEP] What would you do about that?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	4
t the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population. [SEP] And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd. [SEP] Let me just tell you who the jury is. [SEP] The people of Texas. [SEP] There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me. [SEP] And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person. [SEP] So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around. [SEP] I'm just telling you our state	comes	together to do what is right. [SEP] We come together both Republicans and Democrats. [SEP] Let me put that directly to you, Vice President Gore. [SEP] The reason you brought this up, is it -- are you suggesting that those numbers and that record will reflect the way Governor Bush will operate in this area of health insurance as president?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	4
We've talked about supply. [SEP] I just want to know for somebody -- we're getting close to the end of our time here. If somebody wanted to vote on the environment, how would you draw the differences, Governor? Well, I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C. I believe Washington ought to set standards, but again I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and I think we ought to work with people at the local levels. And by the way, I just want to make sure -- I can't let him just say something and not correct it. [SEP] The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas has mandatory emission standards, Mr. Vice President. [SEP] That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it	comes	to grandfathered plants for utilities. [SEP] I think there's a difference. [SEP] I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was -- That was out in the west?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	4
That's pretty much all I need to know, about how you liked reading and things when you were little. [SEP] Is there anything else you'd like to say about this, that	comes	to your mind? [SEP] No, not so much.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PolkMaria.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	4
That's not where we are today. [SEP] I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country. [SEP] I've never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States. [SEP] I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today. [SEP] We have to change that. [SEP] And as president, I am committed to changing that. [SEP] I don't care if the idea	comes	from the other side or this side. [SEP] I think we have to come together and work to change it. [SEP] And I've done that. [SEP] Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues. [SEP] I've reached across the aisle. [SEP] I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	4
