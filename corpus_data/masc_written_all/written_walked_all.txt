Sequels: 45734<n>“I trust you had a safe flight, dismal as the airline was?” I nodded. “How can you tell that?” “I could tell the moment you walked in. Not only was the dust on your shoes suggestive, but you smell faintly of jet fuel & inferior peanuts. That, & your boarding pass is sticking out of your pocket with the airline’s name facing out.” I laughed. “Was it really that easy?” “Of course.” “Can you tell anything else?” She studied me intently once more. I’d have to get used to that. “Well, you’ve been well off; have been walking a great deal as of late; are a frequent writer and are a lefty. That’s all I can tell.” I nearly fell out of my chair. “How...?” “Not many ‘lower’ people, including myself, going around wearing a Rolex like that. I could see your shoes have been worn a few milimeters, but the canvas is fairly new. As far as the writing goes, you’ve a considerable amout of ink & graphite on the side of your left hand.” “You’re a genius!” I cried. She shook her head & smiled. “Deductions, my friend.”<n>Serenity in the Music<n>	#ficlets#	ficlets_1399.txt
“Hey.” A girl, sixteen years old, with masses of bright red hair and big gray eyes opened the door. She snapped her gum, leaning comfortably against the doorway. Loud music sounded from inside.<n>“Hey, Beth.” I walked up the pathway and into Beth’s mansion of a house, pulling at my camisole nervously. Was I ever going to get over being around her? I held in a sigh. Probably not.<n>“Everyone’s downstairs. Get yourself a beer.” Beth pointed down the stairs, to where the music was blasting from. I strode over to the opening. I looked back over my shoulder, seeing if she was coming, but Beth was already on the couch, absorbed with a cute junior. I sighed, out loud this time. She didn’t notice.<n>	#ficlets#	ficlets_1399.txt

Sequels: 45747<n>His fingers ran across the keyboard for a moment. He stared quietly at the screen for a moment, and then smiled, nodding to himself. I watched him move the mouse, saving the document and then clicking on internet explorer. I watched the screen switch to yahoo, and was silent as he sent whatever-it-was to himself. I examined his face in silence. There were deep bags beneath his eyes, and, as he turned to me, I could see how deeply worn he was from the lines on his face. With a jolt of shock, I realized he looked old.“Drew?” I whispered carefully. He stood up and walked toward me.“Thank you,” he croaked, his throat thick with exhaustion.“Sure thing,” I said, still whispering. Suddenly, in an unexpected movement, he hugged me. Shocked, I stood still for a moment and then hugged him back. What had happened last night?“Thank you,” he whispered again and I felt wetness as his eyes overflowed with tears. I realized that I was crying too. Cynthia had died at exactly seven this morning.<n>Mind Twistings<n>	#ficlets#	ficlets_1399.txt
Sequels: 45763<n>The bell rang and our snooty teacher walked in announcing himself. I spent most of the long class either glancing at the clock or glancing at Anna taking notes intently. I noted her eyes, her smile. I’ve never seen one like it. Finally the bell to rang.“So, my next class is,” I looked at my schedule “Algebra with Mrs. Coudrote.” “Ah, the Cood” She said with a sly tone. I figured it was a nickname for the teacher. “Down this hall. Follow me.” I followed. Her walk was hypnotizing. I had to catch myself from standing and staring. I caught up to her side. As we turned the corner, I tried to think of something to say to continue a conversation. “You do know your way around.” I said, regretting words the second they left my mouth. She laughed. “Yah, like I have been here awhile.” “I’ll bet,” I said. Anna began explaining the history of the school and soon I got lost within a few sentences but I didn’t care. I loved listen to her talk. Her voice was soft and quick. I knew I was stuck on her already.<n>Vocal Impulses<n>	#ficlets#	ficlets_1400.txt

Sequels: none<n>Arenn stood high on the cliff, looking down at the smoldering ruins, the smoke blowing into the westward setting sun. The Tall King was deposed, and after centuries of slavery, our people were finally freed, but at what cost? The multitudes, of which I was one, stood behind our rebellious leader as she stood surveying the destruction she had caused with what I feared was contentment. I wanted no more war, but I was afraid that more may follow. As if reading my thoughts, Arenn turned and looked deep into my eyes.“You, child,” she said, beckoning to me. My heart pounding, I slowly walked towards her. Odd, but I had never thought of our leader as beautiful before, only sly. Now she seemed to have the beauty of a raven silently flying overhead, an ebony silhouette against the fire-red sky. “Child,” she said again, “Why do you frown so? Are you not happy to be released after so many long years of imprisonment?” “Of course,” I said, but even as I said so my frown grew deeper. I saw a fire in her black eyes.<n>The Lights go on at Night<n>	#ficlets#	ficlets_1400.txt
Sequels: 45784<n>The girl now known as Alice Black was, in her youth, known by the name of Alice Lepic, daughter of Pierre Lepic, Dawn, and of Claire Anderson, also of an important station, 9:00 in the morning. Alice had never been happy being the daughter of two of the Days. She regarded them- her parents, and all the days, in fact- with a semblance of disdain. The night was the only thing that interested her. She was secretive. Two days before her 13th birthday, her parents, Dawn and Morning Tea, as she called her mother, took her to the Wayward Diviner, as was customary for children of the Days. The Wayward Diviner had no doubt in his mind. He told Alice’s parents who she was to be the heir of as soon as they walked through the door. But they didn’t believe him. They told him to spin the Bone Wheel, so they could see for themselves. They thought he had made a mistake. The Diviner makes no mistakes. Thirteen times the wheel went round, only to confirm his words. Alice was the Midnight Heir.<n>	#ficlets#	ficlets_1400.txt

Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still hadn’t come home. I called Mitch and our other friends, hoping that she’d crashed at one of their houses, but I had no luck. A couple of them remembered seeing her leave, but none of them had seen the thin man with her. I didn’t know how they could miss such exotic features, even in that distorting light.<n>I caught a taxi back to the church. It was still a mess, but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared. I walked across what had been the dance floor. The church was completely different now: sunlight fell through the stained glass, catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry, healthy warmth into the edges of the room, through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights. I realized that Rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and I had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up – which, if she were in a situation where I should be doing something, would probably be never.<n>Standing in the center of the church, I took out my cell phone and called the police. “I need to file a missing persons report. …Rachel Frieze. Last night, walking on West 2nd street around – maybe eleven or twelve o’clock. What? …But, sir, this is an unusual situation. She didn’t come home last night, none of her friends have seen her. …Sir, if she’s in any danger, it will probably be too late to help her by that time. My girlfriend has disappeared, I don’t even know where to start looking, and I need help! …Yes, sir. I understand.” The police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight. I closed the phone.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
Walking out of the church, a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise. A cold front must have hit while I was inside. Glancing down the street, I realized that I didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time, and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran. I pulled my T-shirt’s sleeves down my arms as far as they’d go, but I wasn’t ready for cold.<n>Walking didn’t build up much heat; it just moved the air enough to chill me more. After I’d walked about a block, a car rolled up behind me. It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry. This wasn’t the best of neighborhoods. I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it.<n>I heard an automatic window roll down. “Hey,” said a male voice, “do you need some help?”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
“I know your family. Get in. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and it’s best to start now.”<n>I walked around the car and got into the passenger seat. Before I had my belt on, we were rolling forward. “Okay,” I said. “I’m in the car. Now, will you tell me how you know my family, and how you happened to be driving by just now? In fact, why didn’t you call me by name the first time? And how did you recognize me when – ”<n>“That’s enough! I can only answer one question at a time. I know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours. I am here now because you called for help, and no-one else would answer.” He turned onto the next street and shifted up. “I will help you find your Rachel. I have to warn you, though, you won’t like what I have to tell you.”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
“Thanks, Dvorov. I owe you one. Let’s go.” That last one was to me. I waved goodbye to the hunchback as we left. He gave me a half-hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing, and whether I should be wearing body armor.<n>Back on the street, I began to see things that I had never looked for until then. Still in my initial shock, I suddenly noticed qualities of the people that my mind hadn’t registered when we parked. I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through – people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them, and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail. The yellow of this sky wasn’t just smog: it had a leeching, heavy dimness. I saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light. A corpulent, batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle. Leaning from the rough-hewn window of one building on our right was something with long, green hair draped across the seven gangly arms hanging from its windowsill. Thirty-five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed. I noticed when my back hit the wall that I was walking backwards.<n>“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,” said my driver. I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills. “We interact with humans, take advantage of them, grant them boons, sometimes even become their friends, but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction. At this point, we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
Holding Dvorov’s directions, Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway. I started wondering again how reliable my guide’s credentials were. Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other, he did not inspire confidence.<n>“Just at this corner,” he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east. East is that way.” He pointed at the wall to our right. “Don’t let the sun fool you. Then I’m going to shed a little blood, but don’t worry, none of yours.” I blinked at him, but he just kept walking until we reached the corner. “Okay, you might feel silly, but just turn three times to your left. Try to keep in time with me.” We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust. The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back. When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner. Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening the door. “Are you coming?”<n>We slipped through the door and came out, not inside the building, but on a busy street in a completely different part of town. The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East. Nepthys took us immediately to the right, where he led us to a cart filled with herbs. Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn’t place. The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar. Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart, and with its long, many-shouldered pole of a torso, it rose over our heads even while seated. Its face was small and wrinkled, with penny-sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose. “Would the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs?” it asked. “There are no finer to spice a meal, nor purer to mix a potion. Please, let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs.”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
It hissed thoughtfully. “True, true. Step behind the cart and enter through the door there, using your left hand to open the door and your right – ” he looked at me “ – to close it.”<n>“Thank you.” Nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart.<n>The latch opened under Nepthys’ left hand with a clack! The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs. At the top was one door. We entered.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
“I suppose so,” said Nepthys, “and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up.”<n>We walked back to the herb stand. The vendor stared a little at Amy, his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stand’s little lamp, but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs.<n>When Nepthys opened the little man’s door, he rolled over and grinned to see us, but when Amy walked in, he blanched. “What!” he screamed. “You idiots! You woke it up? Get out of my sight this instant!”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt

“I’m here to see Isis. Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her.”<n>The man closed his eyes. A moment later, he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in. Nepthys walked straight past him and I tried to keep up, taking Amy’s small hand so that she wouldn’t lag behind. I shivered as I walked past the pale man’s blank eyes, wondering what they were staring at. Amy gave my hand a squeeze.<n>Nepthys lead us down a hallway that matched the building’s façade, a vaulted, ribbed intestine of a hallway, whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic. I thought that I saw one rib shift in its setting, like a cat trying to scratch its back against a wall, but when I turned, it was still.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
I stood, and one of her servants took me and Amy to the door. I looked back to see Nepthys whispering something to her. He stood to go, but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment. I turned back to the door. “Come on, Amy,” I said, “he’ll be along soon.”<n>Nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall. When we got there, another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood. He offered it to Nepthys, who opened the box: on velvet lining, a wooden hammer and two stakes.<n>“Mountain ash,” said Nepthys. “That was very kind of her.” Closing the box, he paused beside the open door and looked back at me. “I really hope we find your Rachel,” he said. It looked like he was going to continue, but then he walked out the door.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt

The pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
Dvorov glanced over his shoulder, a little nervous. “I guess, man, but be quick. I don’t want my customers thinkin’ that anything’s wrong, you know?”<n>“Of course. We’ll be in and out in a minute.” Nepthys stepped in and Dvorov walked us towards the dance floor.<n>“So did you get anything out of the guy I sent you to?” Dvorov asked us.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
Arthur rose and shook his hand. "So dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home," he said. "I hope soon to see you in better sorts."<n>They parted and Allan made his way pensively from Arthur's gate. He walked the wheel-ruts, hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust. Some quarter-mile from Arthur's gate, he halted, confronted by a halloo. "Nathan?" he called out to the empty road.<n>The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree. "I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today," said Nathan, "so I thought I'd wait here for you." Nathan's lanky frame, dressed in a loose, tan jacket, fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton. His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface, infusing his body with a rakish energy. "So, Allan," said Nathan, unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside, "how goes life for the quintessential American author?"<n>	#fiction#	fiction_The_Black_Willow.txt
"Heavens, no," said Nathan, aghast. "This is one of the strongest works I've read in ages. It speaks to the deepest storyteller's instinct within us all, yet is entirely original. My dear friend, you have done it. Oh, they may rail against you at first; they may decry you as a heathen or a literary savage; but while those in power say such things, others will read your tales and see their true worth. Believe me when I say that you will be read a century from now."<n>Allan, though dubious as to that possibility, felt some temptation from the compliment; mainly, it granted him the encouragement he still needed. Nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and Allan left it with him, then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face. He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right; although the man was somewhat peculiar, he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight. Certainly, it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them. His mind's strangest fruit had ripened at last, and he found the taste less bitter than expected. These thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home.<n>It was evening, and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last. Passionate, fiery colors filled the western sky before him, though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead. As Allan drew closer, he distinguished a new cloud, a pillar rising directly ahead; a road of smoke ascended in the west, its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_The_Black_Willow.txt
