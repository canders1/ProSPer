Unfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression. [SEP] It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website. [SEP] However, the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons: [SEP] a) Moore clearly states that "before he	came	to Flint", Heston gave an interview. [SEP] In the excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March. [SEP] If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers, why would he say this, and show the month the interview was published? [SEP] b) Why should Moore leave the words "Clinton is on the Today Show" visible in the text, which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part?

[SEP] The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back. [SEP] When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner. [SEP] Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening the door. [SEP] “Are you coming?” [SEP] We slipped through the door and	came	out, not inside the building, but on a busy street in a completely different part of town. [SEP] The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East. [SEP] Nepthys took us immediately to the right, where he led us to a cart filled with herbs. [SEP] Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn’t place. [SEP] The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar.

That made me a little sad. [SEP] They were always my favorite part of the Greek myths I read in elementary school. [SEP] “Well, what about you? How did you get to America?” “My parents	came	over from Russia, just like your family. My real name is a little more ethnically appropriate, but we don’t toss those around in this place. They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary. When the Russian government dammed the river, my parents decided that instead of dying with the river, they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected. I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river. Sure, I miss having a place to settle down, but it’s better than waiting to get dammed.” [SEP] He took another shot of vodka. [SEP] “Shouldn’t you be going light on the vodka? I mean, we might have a lot of work ahead of us.”	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	come	written	masc_written	3
Immediately, I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid. [SEP] “Nathan,” said Nepthys, “I think that you just did something very stupid.” “I agree,” I told him. [SEP] The stone was as warm as human flesh now, and there was a sort of glow that might have been light or just the stone’s soft heat, I don’t know. [SEP] Then there was light, a kind of rosy glow, and I felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air. [SEP] The air around me seemed to still sound, and light	came	in around the corners of my eyes. [SEP] “Do you know what this thing does?” [SEP] I shouted, hardly able to hear myself. [SEP] Nepthys was saying something that looked like, “I have no idea!” but I couldn’t hear him. [SEP] The light in the corners of my eyes rushed in, converging on the rosy glow around the stone, and for a moment I was blind. [SEP] Then I opened my eyes again and saw a girl lying in the street. [SEP] There was no sign of the stone.	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	come	written	masc_written	3

[SEP] Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck. [SEP] “You idiot,” he hissed, “do you know how much you’ve set us back? I should say, set yourself back, since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for.” [SEP] I thought about Rachel; in the excitement, I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts. [SEP] “You’re just lucky that Dvorov isn’t my only contact. Come on, we’re heading out.” [SEP] He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs. [SEP] Walking outside, I was shocked to see that it was already dark. [SEP] “Night comes quickly here,” said Nepthys quietly as he	came	out behind me. [SEP] “Didn’t I warn you?” “Okay,” he said as we hit the street, “we’re going to see another friend of mine. First, though, we are getting you a hat. You look ridiculous with a shaved head.” [SEP] At a nearby stand, he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston. [SEP] It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front. [SEP] Amy liked it, I think. [SEP] She still hadn’t spoken since I named her, so I wasn’t sure.	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	come	written	masc_written	3

[SEP] He was naked, but there was nothing to hide: his body was hairless and completely smooth. [SEP] I only say “he” because he didn’t have a hint of femininity. [SEP] His eyes were white. [SEP] From behind him, I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure’s “A Forest”. [SEP] “I’m here to see Isis. Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her.”	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	come	written	masc_written	3
Something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd, which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before. [SEP] Then I saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking. [SEP] I tried to slip along the edge of the crowd. [SEP] Things with scales and claws kept flailing against me, pressing me into the wall, but I took a breath and kept moving. [SEP] My nose filled with a reek of thick sweat. [SEP] The music began to build, and a strobe	came	on. [SEP] Somewhere toward the center of the dance floor, I heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing – for a second, I was back with my family in Russia, hiding from the cold. [SEP] Then I felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that Amy was following me. I gathered her under my arm. [SEP] Dvorov was somewhere behind me, too, negotiating delicately through his patrons. [SEP] Just in front of me, a massive thing slammed into the wall, sending up a cloud of granite dust. [SEP] It slumped to the floor and I realized that it was a werewolf. [SEP] Its haunches twitched in time to the music. [SEP] As it started to rise, a man with thick, scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him. [SEP] I thought that my odds were better on the dance floor.	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	come	written	masc_written	3
We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us. [SEP] He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall, and we chased up after him, heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held. [SEP] Luckily, the vampire turned off after three stories. [SEP] He ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors, but Nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me. I called out to Amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us. [SEP] Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment. [SEP] Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room, then made a turn out of sight. [SEP] When I	came	to the door at the end of the room, it looked like it had been torn off its hinges. [SEP] I didn’t imagine that Nepthys had done it, and it wasn’t without alarm that I ran after him. [SEP] A black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral. [SEP] The vault rose into obscurity above me, and a massive rose window stood ahead of me. [SEP] The panes looked dyed black, and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter. [SEP] Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber, and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere. [SEP] I couldn’t tell how many people were running, much less where they were. [SEP] On the steps in front of the altar, I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and two other women. [SEP] Then I heard Nepthys shout, “Nathan! Behind you!” [SEP] I whirled and droppe	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	come	written	masc_written	3
I was content to let myself drift away, and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral’s hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek. [SEP] A girl’s voice, soft and almost recognizable, spoke, “Nathan.” [SEP] I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected. [SEP] Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me the hammer and stake. [SEP] I stood and turned toward the altar. [SEP] The vampire was walking just steps ahead of me. I stepped up behind him and raised my hands, which almost seemed to be glowing. [SEP] Then the stake	came	down into his back and one, two, three strikes with the hammer drove it in. [SEP] The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth. [SEP] Behind me, Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys, whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug. [SEP] I pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar.	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	come	written	masc_written	3
The Black Willow Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close. [SEP] Opening a side drawer, he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot. [SEP] After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner. [SEP] His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow. [SEP] The only other illumination	came	from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards. [SEP] Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right. [SEP] The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin. [SEP] Allan reviewed the troops, all prepared to disembark, their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to-be, thus upsetting the apple cart of his life's plan, clarified – of course – by his very time away from her he loved best.	#fiction#	fiction_The_Black_Willow.txt	come	written	masc_written	3
"Before?" "Before that blasted impulse	came	over me and I started writing like Edgar Poe – though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others, thank Heaven."

They parted and Allan made his way pensively from Arthur's gate. [SEP] He walked the wheel-ruts, hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust. [SEP] Some quarter-mile from Arthur's gate, he halted, confronted by a halloo. [SEP] "Nathan?" he called out to the empty road. [SEP] The reply	came	from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree. [SEP] "I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today," said Nathan, "so I thought I'd wait here for you." [SEP] Nathan's lanky frame, dressed in a loose, tan jacket, fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton. [SEP] His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface, infusing his body with a rakish energy. [SEP] "So, Allan," said Nathan, unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside, "how goes life for the quintessential American author?" "I wouldn't know," replied Allan dryly, before continuing in another tone entirely. [SEP] "I destroyed another story last night, Nathan."	#fiction#	fiction_The_Black_Willow.txt	come	written	masc_written	3

[SEP] The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories, but turned down such treatment for other types of watches "because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands."	#newspaper:newswire#	newspaper:newswire_wsj_0026.txt	come	written	masc_written	3
The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long, twisted, arduous.

Moore	came	to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances. [SEP] "It is wrong to kill."	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_ch5.txt	come	written	masc_written	3
y workers regularly meet for lunch or after work. [SEP] In these meeting places, people gather to see old friends, gossip, and make new acquaintances. [SEP] In the workers’ adopted social settings, the transition from friendly chatter to serious business occurs naturally. [SEP] In the Silicon Valley, collective actions unfold through a combination of mutual interests, intellectual curiosity, and problem solving geared towards developing new markets, technologies, products, or applications for computers. [SEP] Workers have a systemic commitment to technical excellence in their field. [SEP] As one engineer explained, the process is quite simple: ‘people rub shoulders and share ideas’ (Saxenian, p. 27). [SEP] The knowledge of these informal groups is so powerful that many ‘local entrepreneurs	came	to see social relationships and even gossip as crucial aspects of their business’ (Saxenian, p. 26) As one local manager claimed: ‘‘‘Over a lunch conversation or a beer, you’ll learn that company A or company B has a technology you want . . . If it fits your needs, you’ll build it into your next product’’’ (Saxenian, p. 31). [SEP] In this manner, micro-level conversations influence the creation of new technologies, products, and applications. [SEP] It is through such social interaction and collective action that we begin to understand how patterns and order emerge in the Valley. [SEP] In the absence of hierarchy and centralised planning, employees in the Valley rely on their skills, rather than on formal position, to provide a reference point for their careers. [SEP] Such self-generated gui	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_CUP2.txt	come	written	masc_written	3
o the United States from South Africa, Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses, which led to an unusual commission: the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse. [SEP] He gave the commercial building in Manchester, Connecticut, a new façade dominated by a large arch, over-scaled voussoirs, and a pediment. [SEP] Inside, the barrel-vaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order. [SEP] Greenberg had graduated from Yale in 1965, and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism. [SEP] However, unlike Venturi and Moore, Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building; he was returning to Classical roots. [SEP] From this modest beginning, over the next two decades,	came	a variety of commissions: a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building, several college and university buildings, and a Roman Catholic church. [SEP] His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens, Georgia, a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills. [SEP] Greenberg is also known for large country houses, both in the United States and in Europe. [SEP] Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope, he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential work—using Georgian and American Colonial styles. [SEP] One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon, another by Palladio’s unfinished Villa Thiene. [SEP] Several are picturesque rambling affairs	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_rybczynski-ch3.txt	come	written	masc_written	3
SEP] Until then, he had been running his own office in Los Angeles for almost twenty years, building shopping centers, suburban offices, department stores, and apartments in competent but unremarkable renditions of L.A. modern. [SEP] The project that brought him to national attention was his own remodeled house: a nondescript bungalow encased in an unsettling Cubist composition of unpainted plywood, corrugated metal, and chain-link fencing. [SEP] The odd shapes and unorthodox materials marked Gehry as a maverick. [SEP] That was in 1978. [SEP] Unexpectedly, he attracted a broad range of commissions, not only residential clients, but also museums, public institutions, universities, corporations, and developers, and not only in the United States but around the world. [SEP] Hunt was 43 when he	came	into his own. [SEP] He had established an architectural practice in New York in 1855, almost immediately on his return from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. [SEP] He was moderately successful, achieving local renown for the Tribune Building, an early New York skyscraper. [SEP] Despite his Parisian background, Hunt worked in the prevalent Ruskinian Gothic style. [SEP] Of his Presbyterian Hospital in downtown Manhattan, the architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler wrote: “The building is of Gothic design with very red brick, and very irregular stone dressings, which, it must be confessed regretfully, are not pleasing to the eye.”3 For his next project, the Lenox Library, Hunt tried something different.
