As one consequence, the number of business failures among U.S. apparel manufacturers climbed from 227 in 1975 to a high of 567 in 1993.14 Not surprisingly, employment in the apparel sector during this period declined appreciably. [SEP] And the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a further reduction in the domestic apparel industry during the period 1996 to 2006 from 864,000 workers to just 714,00015—this from an industry that employed about 1.2 million employees in 1950 and reached a peak of 1.4 million employees in 1973.16 The conventional wisdom explains the industry’s decline in this way: Apparel, particularly women’s apparel, is	driven	by price-based competition among generally small manufacturing and contracting establishments.17 [SEP] Labor costs represent a significant portion of cost for many garment categories,18 and U.S. wage levels far exceed those of competitors in countries like the People’s Republic of China and Mexico.19 [SEP] Although the magnitude of these differences varies as exchange rates fluctuate, under any realistic exchange-rate scenario, the labor cost differential is sufficiently high to put U.S. manufacturers at a very significant competitive disadvantage. [SEP] The manufacture of men’s shirts provides another illustration. [SEP] Throughout much of the post-World War II era, the majority of men’s shirts sold in the United States were white dress shirts, primarily through department stores.

anufacture. [SEP] Garment-making in its current labor-intensive form will eventually be phased out in favor of automated, robotized manufacturing, geared for almost instantaneous transition from one style to another. [SEP] The difficulty of handling cut fabrics by machines may be resolved in the near future, and the quest for higher operating speeds will then receive more attention, taking production levels to new heights.29 [SEP] Yet here the conventional wisdom misses other significant measures of performance. [SEP] Managers in well-integrated channels pay attention to inventory costs, inventory replenishment practices, information reliability, and time to market rather than the traditional direct costs of labor and materials alone. [SEP] In fact, competitive performance is already being	driven	less by how a company manages its assembly operations and more by how it manages the logistics of its operations as a whole. [SEP] Our study shows that an apparel manufacturer can still be successful with a traditionally organized sewing room; a firm with innovative and productive assembly operations, on the other hand, may not be competitively viable if it has not invested in information links with retailers and other changes in management practices. [SEP] Apparel manufacturers are not the only ones learning this lesson the hard way. [SEP] The emphasis on labor productivity that has preoccupied practitioners and analysts in many industries—such as the total labor minutes required to assemble a car—no longer makes as much sense now that information technology has revolutionized retailing in	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	5
Proposition 4:  Instead of fashion as the saving grace of the channel, basic and fashion-basic products will prove critical to its long-term survival. [SEP] When people consider the U.S. apparel industry, they often think of New York City’s Seventh Avenue, which is	driven	by new design, constantly changing seasonal offerings, and a willingness by consumers to pay a premium for the cutting edge of fashion. [SEP] New York City and Los Angeles continue to have a competitive advantage in this area because a large number of designers and manufacturers are located in these cities and can respond quickly to changing demands, as well as shape them. [SEP] This infrastructure allows for “quick response” on the fashion end of the women’s and, to a more limited extent, men’s markets. [SEP] Once established, a variety of proponents believe, the experience at the fashion end can be diffused downward to less fashion-oriented products. [SEP] As a result, some of the fashion-oriented products that had been sourced offshore can then return to the United States. [SEP] Those wi	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	5
Apparel, textile, and fiber firms and retailers have recently joined to launch the Quick Response Program, designed to improve information flow, standardize recording systems, and improve turnaround time throughout the system.... [SEP] The program could be an important boon to productivity and competitiveness.... [SEP] Will Quick Response succeed? [SEP] According to industry experts, that depends on whether it diffuses down to the high-fashion, quick turnaround segments of the industry or, like much new technology in this industry, is adapted to suit the needs of firms still committed to mass production.31 [SEP] Regardless of where Quick Response has succeeded, however, our research indicates that very different time-based competitive demands have emerged in the industry,	driven	not by voluntary acceptance of policies but by the changing nature of market competition among retailers. [SEP] Rather than arising in the fashion, “Seventh Avenue” segment of the industry, the new form of retail competition involves basic and fashion-basic products like jeans, intimate apparel, and T-shirts—the bottom of the fashion triangle. [SEP] Basic and fashion-basic apparel categories now constitute the lion’s share of industry sales, accounting for approximately 72 percent of all shipments.32 [SEP] This implies that a far larger portion of the industry may be viable in the long run than the part that could be saved by “quick response” at the fashion end.33 [SEP] Bear in mind, however, that this viability depends on manufacturers using information to plan and execute production in a 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	5
Alfred Chandler described the last industrial transformation in his well-known book The Visible Hand. [SEP] The use of everything from railroads to an improved postal service, according to Chandler, created enterprises with internal administrative structures that coordinated the flow of goods from many individual producers to many more consumers. [SEP] This administrative coordination reduced “the number of transactions involved in the flow of goods, increased the speed and regularity of that flow, and so lowered costs and improved the productivity of the American distribution system.”4 The parallels with the information integration now occurring in retail-apparel-textile channels—this time	driven	by advances in computer and related technologies—are striking. [SEP] In fact, another industrial transformation is under way, one that rivals the earlier revolution in organizational structure and management. [SEP] The first three sections of this chapter summarize the emergence of the U.S. retail, apparel, and textile industries over the past century, including a number of human resource issues. [SEP] The fourth section looks at their channel relations prior to the mid-1980s, before some enterprises started interacting with each other in new ways. [SEP] This brief historical survey highlights not only the crucial developments that still undergird these industries but also the systems and work practices from an earlier era that no longer match today’s competitive requirements.

put is produced in enterprises that engage in both operations. [SEP] In fact, Lowell and his associates established the first incorporated manufacturing operation when they set up an integrated mill, from cotton to finished fabric.33 [SEP] The cloth produced in weaving mills requires further finishing—such as bleaching, shrinking, dyeing, and printing—before it is ready for sale to the apparel industry, to retail distributors, or to industrial consumers. [SEP] To undertake such a comprehensive set of activities, of course, requires significant capital investment. [SEP] From the outset of the Industrial Revolution, spinning, weaving, and finishing have called for substantial investments in plants, power, and equipment.34 [SEP] Because of this capital intensity, the textile industry has been	driven	by economies of scale. [SEP] American plants have largely succeeded through making huge runs of a limited range of products and, since the 1950s, technological changes on the floor—much quieter machinery, for example, or removal of the ubiquitous cotton dust (now required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) that used to affect both worker performance and the quality of cloth—have dramatically improved industry performance. [SEP] Further, the knitting machine has been a key development in manufacturing technology. [SEP] Knitted goods are an essential and growing segment of the textile industry, a trend that reflects the increasing demand for casual wear. [SEP] The knitting machine produces cloth as the loom does but uses a different method. [SEP] The warp knitting machine p	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	5
long with a number of other retailers, began another revolution in the industry. [SEP] Sam Walton started small in the 1970s, but Wal-Mart rapidly became the largest retailer in the United States, with total sales in fiscal year 1995 equaling the combined sales volumes of Kmart, Sears Roebuck and Co., and the supermarket chain The Kroger Co., the next three largest American retail organizations. [SEP] Walton’s successful innovations placed enormous pressure on other mass merchant retailers to alter their practices along similar lines. [SEP] By the late 1980s, a growing number of retailers had started changing the way they did business. [SEP] As we have emphasized, the current retail revolution—involving new information technologies, new product labeling, and new methods of distribution—has	driven	changes in the apparel and textile industries as well. [SEP] Yet this revolution didn’t happen overnight; nor was it the brainchild of a single entrepreneur. [SEP] In fact, the retail systems of both Wanamaker and Walton integrated a variety of innovations that had already been pioneered by other retailers. [SEP] For example, Wanamaker’s “one-price” policy was initially adopted by wholesaler Arthur Tappan in the 1820s and experimented with by Lord & Taylor in 1838 and Rowland Macy in the early 1850s. [SEP] Similarly, bar codes and electronic scanning—key building blocks of new retailing practices—began in the grocery industry. [SEP] Kmart became the first major nonfood retailer to employ them as a means of tracking inventory in the early 1980s, several years before Walton made this technolo	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch3.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	5
puter pen is used to outline a panel of the garment with a sequence of contact points. [SEP] The computer, on command, then connects the image of the points on its screen with a series of line segments that form the silhouette of the pattern piece. [SEP] Another computer command adds the seam allowance and, after the desired modifications have been made, a piece of the new design is created. [SEP] When all the individual pieces of the garment have been modified and entered into the computer system, the final garment pattern is ready to be cut and sewn into a sample garment. [SEP] Numerically controlled fabric cutters are now available that can rapidly and accurately cut patterns from a single ply of cloth, removing the usual obstacle to sample garment-making. [SEP] The cutting equipment is	driven	by the output of a pattern-grading and marker-making program. [SEP] Note that this entire design sequence can take as little as part of a day, yielding a sample garment hung on a mannequin. [SEP] Again, the time it takes managers to reach a decision is what determines the length of this process. [SEP] However, it may take months to produce a sample garment in a desired fabric simply because that fabric takes months to make.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	5
Simpler spreading machines have no on-board computer, but they do unroll the bolt of cloth “unstressed” and properly aligned with the edge of the ply below. [SEP] However spreading is done, it is important for the plies to lie directly on top of each other. [SEP] Misalignment of the edges can ruin many pattern pieces and the final garments for which they were intended. [SEP] Once a ply is laid down, it is almost impossible to shift it because of the friction between the plies. [SEP] With simple spreading machines, the operator must look for fabric defect indicators placed in the selvage by the textile manufacturer. [SEP] After the cloth is spread, it is ready for the appropriate marker to be fit on top and fixed to the lay of fabric. [SEP] Sometimes staples are	driven	through the paper into the underlying cloth. [SEP] If the lay is made by hand, then the cloth is generally cut directly by hand-guided electric knives that slice through the cloth on the table. [SEP] If computer-controlled cutting is used, the lay of cloth is pulled onto the cutting table by an underlying paper sheet. [SEP] In either case, the pattern pieces can now be cut.

Some magazine advertisements for upscale men’s dress suits tout hand-cutting by experienced tailors. [SEP] Occasionally the ads include a drawing of a man with a large pair of scissors. [SEP] But cloth is rarely cut this way, even when only one ply is cut at a time. [SEP] An eight- or twelve-inch pair of scissors is an unwieldy instrument, difficult to guide within the 1/32th of an inch of the pattern outline. [SEP] It is even harder to accurately cut the notches used by sewing operators to align cut parts. [SEP] Most often, an electrically	driven	vertical reciprocating knife is used to cut the fabric. [SEP] The vertical knife oscillates less than three-quarters of an inch but can cut cloth plies a foot or more in thickness. [SEP] The knife and motor are supported above the base plate by a frame. [SEP] The frame also gives the cutter a place to grip the machine for hand-guided cutting. [SEP] The base plate is a smooth cap with a slit to contain the moving end of the knife. [SEP] The knives have built-in sharpeners that run a stone up and down the blade every few minutes. [SEP] In such a “hand-cutting” operation, the operator guides the knife along the outlines on the paper marker fixed to the fabric lay. [SEP] One hand holds the marker on the lay, the other guides the electric knife.

[SEP] The average annual capital investment in sewing machines and attachments per operator in our survey was $720 (in 1992 dollars). [SEP] Some of the machines in an American men’s dress-shirt plant like the one previously described will cost $20,000 or more, but such automated sewing systems are rare. [SEP] As we have already noted, the general requirement for return on investment forces expensive capital equipment to be operated under more than single-shift conditions, unless it is essential to produce a given item. [SEP] The automated sewing systems that create the closely spaced regular stitch patterns used as decorative top stitching on men’s dress shirts, collars, cuffs, and pockets are examples of expensive machines operated for a single shift. [SEP] Because assembly operations are	driven	more by labor costs than capital-intensive equipment, a typical American sewing factory operates just a single shift a day, with an average of about thirty-seven hours of work per week.11 [SEP] On the men’s side of the industry, factories of up to several hundred workers are common, but smaller loft shops are typical for women’s apparel. [SEP] Factories are located where the workforce lives. [SEP] And the infrastructure needed to support a sewing room is relatively modest. [SEP] Power in the form of electricity, water—especially if items like jeans are to be washed—and a phone are about all that is required. [SEP] In some developing countries, workers are brought to the factories, which are generally located at the outer reaches of the local industrial infrastructure.

[SEP] Yet, the particular German emphasis on these values would probably not appeal in the same measure to other European courts. [SEP] The Germans themselves have coined a unique, hard-to-translate phrase to describe the controversies that have	driven	their system of justice for the last fifty years.

[SEP] In real life, we cannot reenact the forty years of wandering in the desert that the Hebrews had to endure before they could shake off their ingrained ways and a new generation could seek redemption under the law.

 reactions. [SEP] At equilibrium, the net rate of formation or destruction of each molecular species is zero, aside from small fluctuations that damp out. [SEP] Thus, if two molecular species, X and Y, interconvert, the equilibrium is attained at that ratio of X and Y concentrations at which Y converts to X as fast as X converts to Y. If the reaction is displaced in one direction, say there is a higher X concentration than the equilibrium ratio, then the spontaneous, or exergonic, reaction proceeds in the direction toward equilibrium that reduces the excess of X concentration (Figure 3.3). [SEP] All spontaneous chemical reactions, if coupled to no other source of energy, are exergonic.

 first additional system consists in pyrophosphate, PP, a high-energy dimer of monophosphate that breaks down to form two monophosphates, P + P. Like any reaction, the reaction converting PP to P + P has an equilibrium, hence an equilibrium ratio of PP and P. In the presence of excess PP compared to equilibrium, the reaction flows toward equilibrium by the spontaneous cleavage of PP to yield P + P. My purpose in invoking the exergonic conversion of PP to P + P is to utilize the loss of free energy in this exergonic reaction to drive the DNA trimer-hexamer reaction beyond its own equilibrium, leading thereby to an excess synthesis of the 3’CCCGGG5’ hexamer when compared to its equilibrium concentration. [SEP] Thus, the excess synthesis of the hexamer, which would not occur spontaneously, is	driven	endergonically by being coupled to the exergonic breakdown of PP to P + P (Figure 3.4). [SEP] In short, the exergonic breakdown of PP to P + P supplies the free energy to drive the excess buildup of 3’CCCGGG5’ concentration beyond its own equilibrium with respect to its trimer substrates, 5’GGG3’ and 5’CCC3’. [SEP] The excess synthesis of 3’CCCGGG5’ constitutes excess reproduction of the hexamer autocatalytic reaction product beyond that which would occur without the coupling to the additional PP free energy source. [SEP] Thus, the system is reproducing “better” with the coupling to PP than without the coupling.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	5
 that free energy is used up. [SEP] In order to have a renewed internal supply of the free energy needed to synthesize excess hexamer, it is convenient to resynthesize pyrophosphate from the two monophosphates, P + P. I’ll return below to the meaning of “convenient,” for in a general sense, the convenience reflects the organization of processes that sustains an agent, and that organization is not convenient, it is essential. [SEP] Resynthesis of PP from P + P requires the addition of free energy. [SEP] This is true because we used the exergonic breakdown of PP to P + P to drive the excess synthesis of 3’CCCGGG5’. [SEP] Now we need to add energy to resynthesize PP from P + P. To do so, I invoke an additional source of free energy in the form of an electron, e, which absorbs a photon, hv; is	driven	endergonically to an excited state, e*, and falls back exergonically to its low-energy state, e, in a reaction that is coupled to the synthesis of PP from P + P. The point of this third reaction-couple is clear: PP is resynthesized from P + P so that PP can continue to drive the excess synthesis of the DNA hexamer, 3’CCCGGG5’. [SEP] Overall, the total system of linked reactions is exergonic = there is an overall loss of free energy that is ultimately supplied by the incoming photon, hv, plus the 2 substrates, 5’GGG3’, and 5’CCC3’. [SEP] Thus, we are not cheating the second law.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	5
mer and back around to PP via the reaction with the high-energy electron. [SEP] The macroscopic cycling of matter around this cycle is the engine at work. [SEP] (I am grateful to Peter Wills for this clarification of the concept of a chemical motor.) [SEP] In addition, depending upon the details of the kinetic constants, our autonomous agent may literally show an oscillatory concentration cycle in which PP concentration begins high and falls as P + P is formed, then the high PP concentration is reformed by use of the photon-energized exergonic e*  e reaction. [SEP] Thus, the PP P + P reaction embedded in the autonomous agent constitutes a chemical engine in which there is a macroscopic net flux of matter around the PP  P + P cycle, which is operating displaced from equilibrium as it is	driven	by addition of energy from the photon, hv, and addition of the two DNA trimers, and as energy is drained oV to drive excess synthesis of the DNA hexamer. [SEP] The fourth thing to note about the autonomous agent is that, like the Carnot engine, the steam engine, the gas engine, and the electric engine, the autonomous agent works in a cycle. [SEP] At the end of the cycle the system is poised to cycle again. [SEP] A repeating organization of process is achieved. [SEP] And next, just as the Carnot engine run backward is a refrigerator and not a pump, if the reactions of the autonomous agent were run backward the PP  P + P engine would run in the reverse direction. [SEP] This is because all reaction couples would be displaced from equilibrium the opposite way and the analogue of throwing the g	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	5
lipsistic eVorts to make my own living as a scientist. [SEP] But natural games are not quite so straightforward. [SEP] I begin by mentioning again the rather surprising no-free-lunch theorem proved by Bill Macready and David Wolpert as postdoctoral fellows at the Santa Fe Institute a few years ago. [SEP] Recall that Bill and David were wondering whether there might be some search algorithm for adapting on a fitness landscape that was inherently better than all other algorithms. [SEP] For example, John Holland, another Santa Fe Institute colleague, is justly well-known for inventing his “genetic algorithm” to optimize hard computational problems. [SEP] The genetic algorithm, which has been rather widely used in academic and industrial settings, is based on analogy with biological adaptation	driven	by mutation, recombination, and selection. [SEP] In eVect, Bill and David were wondering whether biological systems in this biosphere happen to have stumbled on the best possible optimization procedure. [SEP] Importantly, the answer appears to be no. [SEP] Macready and Wolpert considered a mathematically well-formulated set of “all possible fitness landscapes” and showed that, averaged over all landscapes, no search algorithm outperforms any other algorithm. [SEP] No free lunch.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	5
Yet we hardly know how to say what this propagation and elaboration of organization and process is, nor have we a clue about whether there may be general laws that govern such self-constructing nonequilibrium processes. [SEP] Such a law could be my hoped-for fourth law of thermodynamics for open self-constructing systems. [SEP] We have begun with autonomous agents. [SEP] But we are here	driven	beyond bio-spheres. [SEP] What are the general conditions that allow such self-constructing nonequilibrium processes to flourish? [SEP] Are biospheres the only examples? [SEP] What of the evolution of the geology of a planet, a solar system, a galaxy, the universe as a whole? [SEP] Are there ways of thinking about the emergence of structures that measure and discover sources of energy in nonequilibrium systems, together with the emergence of structures and processes that couple to sources of energy, do work to construct constraints, and propagate the constrained release of the discovered energy such that more diverse structures, constraints, and processes can arise, de novo, in the adjacent possible of the evolving universe?

My Rube Goldberg device propagates work; it succeeds in creating a sequence of coordinated macroscopic changes in the physical universe. [SEP] I do not know a formal definition of “propagating work,” so, in the absence of anything better, I will point at what I mean by Figure .b. [SEP] We have some clues in place now. [SEP] Work is the constrained release of energy. [SEP] Often constraints themselves are the consequence of work. [SEP] I have tentatively defined an autonomous agent as a self-reproducing system that carries out at least one work cycle. [SEP] In turn, this led us to note that an autonomous agent is necessarily a nonequilibrium device, therefore, that it stores energy. [SEP] To think about work cycles, we have been	driven	to ask about Maxwell’s demon, measurement, when and why measurement pays, thence to what features of a nonequilibrium system are measured such that they constitute a source of energy, thence to how couplings arise that capture the energy source, thence to work and constraints, and now to propagating work due to the occurrence of linked sets of constraints and flows of matter and energy. [SEP] A next step is to realize that the only well-known autonomous agents, namely real cells such as yeast, bacteria, your cells and mine, do actually carry out linked processes in which spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes are coupled to build constraints on the release of energy. [SEP] The energy, once released, constitutes work that propagates to carry out more work, building more constraints on the 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	5

[SEP] Even here, the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language, wherever new sentences can be created, is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole. [SEP] If the conversation we recent two-legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive, so too is the chemical conversation in any full-fledged ecosystem, where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another. [SEP] I suppose I am naively	driven	to consider that the biosphere, with its urgent diversity in which, emboldened by all our know-how, we do get on with a very rich conversation, may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks.

Consider an ecosystem with dierent species of bacteria. [SEP] Each species may secrete dierent chemical species, S, that impinge on a subset, C, of the other cell species. [SEP] In Figure . [SEP] I show a three-dimensional coordinate system. [SEP] One axis shows the order-chaos axis for a single isolated bacterium, measured by Derrida curve criteria, with order on the left, near the origin, and chaos on the right. [SEP] The remaining axes show C and S. If a given cell is at the phase transition between order and chaos, and additional molecular inputs, S per cell, come from C dierent types of cells, the total connectivity in the cell is raised from KN to KN + CS. [SEP] The results will typically drive that cell into the chaotic regime. [SEP] Indeed, the entire community will be	driven	into the chaotic regime. [SEP] Hence, in the coordinate system of Figure . [SEP] , Igor Yakushin at Bios Group has shown that a hyperbolic surface, as shown, separates the ordered regime from the chaotic regime. [SEP] Cells can buer themselves from chemical perturbations from other species by retreating deeper into the ordered regime. [SEP] This can be accomplished by increasing the number of canalyzing inputs per gene. [SEP] And indeed, as described above, individual eukaryotic cells do appear to lie well within the ordered regime, perhaps as buering for the fact that such cells, like yeast, live in microbial communities or, like human cells, live in tissues where each cell is bombarded with chemical signals from other cells in the same body.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	5

Recall the Noah’s Vessel experiment, with two of every species ground up in a blender, breaking all cell membranes, comingling the trillion or so proteins of the hundred million species with the thousands of small molecule metabolites. [SEP] A supracritical explosion of chemical diversity would presumably ensue. [SEP] As I noted, life has learned to avoid that fate. [SEP] Cells are subcritical. [SEP] Were they not, then any new chemical that chanced to enter the cells of Fredricka the fern would unleash a cascade of synthesis of novel molecular species, some of which would presumably kill poor Fredricka. [SEP] Best defense? [SEP] Stay subcritical. [SEP] Why mess with that mess? [SEP] But recall that a mixed microbial community should be able to be	driven	to the subcritical-supracritical boundary by increasing the diversity of microbial species present and/or hitting the community with a sucient diversity of novel small molecule species. [SEP] My argument follows that if the community is supracritical, the novel cascading molecular species will kill o some of the microbial species, thereby lowering the community toward the subcritical regime. [SEP] On the other hand, mutation and immigration should drive the community toward the supracritical regime. [SEP] Do mixed microbial communities hover on the subcritical-supracritical boundary? [SEP] We have seen other reasons that bound a community’s complexity, including Ksat problems noted in this chapter.

[SEP] In a similar spirit, microfinancing of a linked diversity of cottage businesses in the third world and the first world seems to be achieving local economic growth where more massive eorts at education and infrastructure, Aswan dams and power grids, seem to fail. [SEP] Indeed, in the same way in an ecosystem, organisms create niches for other organisms. [SEP] I suspect, therefore, that over the past . [SEP] billion years, the growth of diversity of species is autocatalytic, for the number of possible niches increases more rapidly than the number of species filling niches. [SEP] And in the linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes, the universe as a whole advances autocatalytically into its adjacent possible,	driven	by the very increase of diversity by which novel displacements from equilibrium come into existence, are detected, are coupled to, and come to drive the endergonic creation of novel kinds of molecules and other entities. [SEP] Economic growth is part and parcel of the creativity of the universe as a whole. [SEP] Think of the Wright brothers’ airplane. [SEP] It was a recombination between an airfoil, a light gasoline engine, bicycle wheels, and a propeller. [SEP] The more objects an economy has, the more novel objects can be constructed.

[SEP] The material fabric of old buildings—the heavy beams, rough brick walls, and solid woodwork—is one of their chief pleasures. [SEP] That is why we feel cheated by hollow walls, flimsy doors, and shaky balustrades. [SEP] Buildings should last and feel as though they will. [SEP] One might assume that just as the highest-rated cars—Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus—represent the highest standards of automobile technology, the most admired architecture would be the best built. [SEP] This was generally true in the past, but in the twentieth century, when new materials and new aesthetic theories often have	driven	architects to cavalier experimentation, even celebrated architects have fallen short in that department. [SEP] Le Corbusier’s white suburban villas, for example, were crudely finished in cement plaster on top of brick, and since the architect usually ignored (for aesthetic reasons) intrusive metal flashing and coping strips, the crude “machines for living” often aged poorly. [SEP] Some Frank Lloyd Wright buildings have leaky skylights, sagging overhangs, and defective heating systems. [SEP] This does not make them any less delightful to visit, but it must make them considerably less delightful to inhabit.

[SEP] Rupert’s Land was bought from the H.B.C. in 1869, but incorporating Manitoba was not so easy. [SEP] Led by Louis Riel, Métis descendants of Indians and French fur traders waged an armed struggle for land rights on the Red River in the face of the expansion-hungry railway builders. [SEP] An impassioned politician as well as a fiery military leader, Riel won local Anglo-Saxon support for his proposed Manitoba Act guaranteeing equal French and English language rights in school and church. [SEP] But the execution of a troublemaker from Toronto brought in a retaliatory force of Ontario troops, and Riel fled to the United States.

[SEP] Expanding at a purposeful but more leisurely pace than other leading Canadian cities, Vancouver has never lost sight of the importance of enjoying life at the same time.

] Though he had begun his campaign without the King’s authority, once news of the treasures captured by Cortés reached Madrid, a royal warrant was dispatched to legitimize the victory and create “New Spain” — the latest Spanish colony. [SEP] However, it was left to Don Francisco de Montejo, “a gentleman of Seville,” following in the great conquistador’s wake, to take possession of the Yucatán in the name of the Spanish king. [SEP] Arriving on the coast in 1527, Montejo’s forces were hindered by the dense jungle and withering climate, and were met by fierce resistance from the natives. [SEP] To make matters worse, news of great riches discovered in Peru led many of his men to desert in search of greater rewards. [SEP] The campaign went so badly that by 1535 the Spaniards had been completely	driven	out of the Yucatán. [SEP] In 1537 another force, under the command of Montejo el Mozo (the Younger), Don Francisco’s son, set out to plant the Spanish standard on Yucatecan soil. [SEP] At first ill fortune dogged them; the dwindling force was besieged in Champotón, on the west coast, for two miserable years. [SEP] With reinforcements, the Spaniards managed to establish a beachhead. [SEP] A band of only 57 men, led by Montejo el Mozo’s cousin (yet another Don Francisco), marched inland to take the Mayan village of T’Ho. [SEP] The Indians gathered their forces for one last great battle, and thousands of them fell upon the Spanish camp, now defended by 200 men.

 collected. [SEP] The geography of the northern Yucatán region separated it physically from the rest of New Spain, and fewer colonial landowners settled here than the area around the new capital (now Mexico City). [SEP] Furthermore, this isolation led to the development of a strong independent streak for both colonists and indigenous peoples. [SEP] The Yucatán declared its independence in 1821 but did not join the fledgling country of Mexico until 1823. [SEP] In 1840, it changed its mind, and withdrew from the union. [SEP] This was the catalyst for the oppressed Maya to take up arms against their colonial oppressors. [SEP] In 1847, a savage uprising known as the Caste War saw Mayan rebels massacre white settlers and take control of nearly two-thirds of the peninsula. [SEP] By 1850 they had	driven	the Mexicans back to their strongholds in Mérida and Campeche. [SEP] However, in an amazing turnaround, the Maya’s ancient beliefs became their undoing. [SEP] Just when the Mexicans were on the point of surrender, the rains came early and the Indians, obedient to their gods, dropped their weapons and returned to their milpas to plant the sacred corn. [SEP] The settlers called in reinforcements and wreaked a terrible revenge on the natives. [SEP] One group of rebels, known as the Chan Santa Cruz, held out in the jungles of Quintana Roo around the city of Tulum, harrying the Mexicans and making the east coast of the Yucatán a dangerous area, off-limits until well into the 20th century.
