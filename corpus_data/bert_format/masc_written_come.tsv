A further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic “Indianness”, both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside Spanish culture. [SEP] The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not “Indian enough”; it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 85). [SEP] Politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly, even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking Spanish; indigenous identity has be	come	a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself. [SEP] The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group; the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self-determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences. [SEP] Efforts towards development, then, cannot endanger traditional culture and values, for fear of losing cultural legitimacy (Jackson 1995: 5). [SEP] There develops a duality in native culture; for example, many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside the classroom.

tók is one of the many early-twentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality. [SEP] While we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind, and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions, by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work. [SEP] Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music—their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum. [SEP] But if we apply it to music such as Bartók’s that is in the middle area, we can	come	up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results. [SEP] To do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the Concerto for Orchestra. [SEP] By applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of the tonal realm, we not only find the elements of tonality that do remain, but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions. [SEP] It is not disputed that Bartók’s music has great expressive power—perhaps now we can understand why. [SEP] References	#essays#	essays_Bartok.txt	come	written	masc_written	1

[SEP] I realized that Rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and I had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up – which, if she were in a situation where I should be doing something, would probably be never.

[SEP] “Nepthys!” said the woman, slithering up across the furs to sit up. [SEP] As she rose, her robes fell open and I realized that, except for what looked like a red silk kimono, she was naked – naked and stunning. [SEP] I had an urge to cover Amy’s eyes. [SEP] “It’s been years since I’ve seen you. Please,	come	and sit beside me, and introduce your friends.” “This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in the human world,” said Nepthys, ushering us toward the woman in silk.

[SEP] They took their seats within the car and his driver set the horses trotting. [SEP] For a few yards, they kicked up dust along the roadway; then they raised their hooves and took to the air. [SEP] She gaped, afraid but knowing that no harm would	come	to her by his hand. [SEP] The New England woods disappeared, even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky. [SEP] Above them, the Milky Way drew near as if the stars themselves could be reached. [SEP] A magnificent glow infused the carriage as they merged with the sky's glory. [SEP] Allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window. [SEP] "Damn you," he cried, "will you never leave me be? Shall I never finish a story in peace?"

[SEP] His thoughts were not of the act's futility, nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing; instead, all that filled his mind was the tree's constant presence in his life, growing with him and beside him, its persistent reminders that he had higher, truer things to write, the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake. [SEP] His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn, burning logs, but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes, tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers. [SEP] But he did not weep. [SEP] Instead, he bethought himself of the loss of the tree; considered also Arthur's motivation and whether some good might not	come	of this, after all. [SEP] Leaving the circle of ashes, he stood and turned towards the woods, in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood. [SEP] He stepped slowly beneath the branches, a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great, swirling eddy, a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willow's last breath. [SEP] Allan wandered beneath the trees for a time, thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog, strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate. [SEP] He considered Arthur's intervention; considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested, to write stories that others would read; for after all, what purpose writing if not to be read?

USSRSOS Some new information has	come	to light over the Kursk disaster. [SEP] (For those with short attention spans, the Kursk was the submarine that blew up and sank in the Arctic Ocean killing all 118 on board.) [SEP] The Russians tried to blame the incident on a collision with an unidentified object. [SEP] However, sonar tapes which recorded the blasts (a small one at first, then a much larger one, two minutes later), cast doubt on these claims. [SEP] A whistle-blower within the Russian military has leaked that the crew of the Kursk was testing a new type of torpedo when the accident occurred. [SEP] It seemed very likely that the test didn't go quite as planned. [SEP] While rescue efforts to save the survivors of the Kursk failed, salvage crews were able to recover a 'Black Box' from the submarine which recorded events leadi	#jokes#	jokes_jokes10.txt	come	written	masc_written	5

To illustrate the preceding argument we will apply Weick’s ideas to descriptions provided by AnnaLee Saxenian (1996) on the dynamics of the Silicon Valley and by Candace Jones (1996) on the independent film industry. [SEP] We reinterpret the contributions of these authors by explicitly re-framing them within Weick’s framework (and we emphasise it is these three authors, and their original descriptions and ideas, that deserve the major part of the credit for this chapter). [SEP] To show how enactment and associated principles of self-organising and learning	come	to life, we will trace the process of enactment in each setting. [SEP] First, we will describe the factors that have contributed to boundaryless career forms in each example. [SEP] Next, we will cite some of the characteristics that make the resulting circumstances ‘weak’. [SEP] After that we will discuss the social behaviour and collective actions that fill the resulting void in the environment. [SEP] Finally, we will point out the patterns, order, and shape we see enactment bringing to each of these respective settings. [SEP] By doing so we hope to convey the pervasive qualities of both the process of enactment and the vehicle through which it operates – the boundaryless career.

The Silicon Valley The Silicon Valley is notorious for the individual and collective success of its firms. [SEP] So much so that the name ‘Silicon Valley’ has	come	to be synonymous with the electronics industry. [SEP] The region is regarded as the centre for excellence and innovation and has given rise to some of the world’s most influential firms, including Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Intel. [SEP] Since its inception the Valley has operated with an individualistic open labour market. [SEP] Today, the learning advantages that emanate from associated boundaryless career behaviour are regarded as a key source of competitive advantage for the region (Saxenian, 1996). [SEP] One can argue that the Valley’s ‘boundarylessness’ is a necessary feature of operating in a dynamic industry that demands constant innovation.

1995). [SEP] Today, Hewlett’s and Terman’s philosophy permeates the region. [SEP] Despite fierce inter-firm competition, open information exchange is common practice among the region’s producers. [SEP] Several features of the Valley contribute to creating a ‘weak’ environment. [SEP] The high pace of technology and product life cycles, fluidity of firm formation and failure, rapid employee turnover resulting in little com-pany-specific socialisation, as well as a lack of meaningful institutionally based hierarchy, all contribute to an environment in which individuals rely on alternative cues to guide their behaviour. [SEP] For example, in the Valley, technology moves quickly and competition is tough. [SEP] New firms form almost overnight -and many disappear just as quickly.
