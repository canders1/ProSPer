ed to continue. [SEP] Indeed, much of Asian sourcing has been devoted to such items, with production shifting within Asia away from regions where wage levels have risen. [SEP] But for basic and fashion basic apparel products, for which frequent replenishment orders are becoming the norm, the practice of sourcing some of the assembly and sewing operations from nearby lower wage regions and countries is emerging. [SEP] At the same time, design, distribution centers, marketing—even cutting—as well as some short-cycle assembly remain in the market region. [SEP] As we pointed out in Chapter 13, regionalization of apparel production in three main areas has started to occur. [SEP] In the U.S. market, most sewing operations take place in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin; in Europe, sewing operations	go	to North Africa, Turkey, and Eastern Europe; and in Japan, sewing operations	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch15.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
A second method has involved mobilizing public pressure on consumers, retailers, and manufacturers to raise the incentives for voluntary compliance with labor standards.

The NRF fields a deluge of calls each week about the Internet’s impact on retailing. [SEP] The most common question we get from reporters: “How long will it take for the Internet to completely replace physical retailing?” [SEP] We have observed that traditional retailers are taking a cautious approach to the Internet. [SEP] Yet most understand its great potential, even if they openly admit they don’t have all the answers.43 [SEP] A limited number of retailers are currently experimenting with the Internet, although only 9 percent of those surveyed in 1998 indicated that they currently sell products this way.44 [SEP] Retailers are currently reluctant to	go	on-line both because they believe that their products are “ill-suited for Web sales” and are concerned about specific technical limitations, such as the security of electronic financial transactions.45 [SEP] A number of developments, many linked to issues we have discussed, indicate both the potential and limitations of electronic retailing. [SEP] In one sense, the Internet offers opportunities akin to mail-order retailing for playing a very lean game. [SEP] For example, Lands’ Ends became an early leader in adopting certain lean retailing elements into its catalog operations and has aggressively entered Internet retailing. [SEP] This retailer launched its Web site in 1995, the first major apparel retailer to do so. [SEP] Its site incorporates an encryption system to protect customers again	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch15.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
of mail-order sales with even lower transaction costs. [SEP] However, the obstacles to virtual retailing remain formidable. [SEP] Product offerings are limited in Web retail sites—the Lands’ End site, for example, offered only 500 products in 1997. [SEP] In addition, just as in other areas of modern retailing, a company must have a distribution system capable of getting products out efficiently on an order-by-order basis, either through internal resources or use of third-party consolidators. [SEP] The economics of distribution for Web retailing, like catalog retailing, are therefore quite different from those developed even by advanced in-store lean retailers. [SEP] Finally, measurement, fit, color, and texture remain central components of apparel sales. [SEP] In apparel—unlike the sale of	go	ods via the Internet such as computers, software, or tools—people want to see, feel, and try on the products. [SEP] These aspects of selling apparel items do not fit well with “virtual retailing.” [SEP] The mail-order business already contends with this problem, and these retailers cope with returns that sometimes	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch15.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
this product was not promoted at retail with discounted prices at any time during this period, so the variation is not due to consumers preferring to purchase a product when it was “on sale.” [SEP] In addition, the demand peak for the 43-regular occurs in week 10, which was only an average demand week for the 46-regular. [SEP] It is useful to outline the ordering and manufacturing processes on a weekly basis to see how this manufacturer’s inventory policies might differ for the two different sizes. [SEP] Suppose that, as described in Chapter 6, the retailer consolidates POS data for the previous week’s sales each Sunday night and places a replenishment order with our manufacturer. [SEP] On Monday, the manufacturer (1) processes the order; (2) picks and packs the desired items from finished	go	ods inventory and ships them to the retailer; and (3) places a factory order to manufacture those items that it shipped that day. [SEP] Assume that the manufacturing lead time—the amount of time required to	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
t must choose which products to assemble in each plant. [SEP] In many cases, the choice is between a more expensive plant—probably located close to the market—that provides shorter lead times and a more distant supplier that takes longer to make items but does so at a lower unit cost. [SEP] Under the traditional retailing system, suppliers filled an order by carrying out assembly in the least costly plant, as long as its quality was adequate for the market for which the product was destined. [SEP] In a lean retailing world, however, factors other than the direct costs of assembly and transportation need to be considered. [SEP] Caught between lean retailers’ need for immediate replenishment and the high risk of carrying inventory for products with uncertain demand, a manufacturer today must	go	beyond traditional direct costs and also include manufacturing lead times and inventory carrying costs in its sourcing equation. [SEP] Most production managers instinctively believe that having at least some manufacturing capability close to the market adds value to the company, but expressing that value in dollars and cents, and making specific allocations of products to plants, are difficult. [SEP] Manufacturers—whether of suits, CDs, office products, or pasta—generally classify products in terms of product lines. [SEP] Planning, therefore, is done for fall fashion lines, jazz ensemble CDs, yellow legal pads, or fettuccine pasta products. [SEP] Even if this method of cate	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
tionally, a new apparel design was created by asking the designer/artist to make a watercolor sketch. [SEP] If the fabric was to have a pattern, there might also be a close-up colored sketch of it. [SEP] Many designs would be grouped together into a storyboard, which was then presented to managers for final decisions. [SEP] Next the designs that passed this stage went through a technical design step in which details were added and patterns made. [SEP] After this step, fabric might be cut and a sample made to see how it would look on a mannequin. [SEP] If the new garment was a blouse, for example, the designer might wish to see how it looked with skirts planned for the collection. [SEP] If the designer was not satisfied with the drape of the garment, the fit, or the pattern, he or she might	go	back to square one. [SEP] Several iterations of these initial design steps could add weeks or months to the process before production began. [SEP] Although some haute couture or high-end apparel designers may still work in this manner, each year more garments are designed using computer technology. [SEP] In our survey, 40 percent of the business units reported using Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) systems to prepare new products in 1992. [SEP] Employing CAD was particularly common among the largest business units in our sample. [SEP] The use of modern design tools and information technology can collapse the design time so that managerial decision-making becomes the longest step in the process—and even the time for that step can be shortened with information technology. [SEP] The new way allows 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Mass Customization The percentage of the population wearing factory-made apparel has grown steadily since the nineteenth century. [SEP] Some still rely on custom-made clothing, especially those who have to	go	this route because of their size and shape or those with the money to afford custom tailoring. [SEP] Although many might like to have customized clothing, few consider it a realistic option. [SEP] It is only recently that “mass customization” may make sense for both consumers and apparel-makers.10 [SEP] Mass customization involves a number of preassembly innovations. [SEP] When somebody orders custom-made clothing, his or her measurements are taken by a fitter in a store and, three to six weeks later, the garment appears. [SEP] In this case, how was the suit, shirt, pants, or pair of jeans made? [SEP] Were all the preassembly steps followed or did an individual tailor cut the cloth and make the entire garment? [SEP] The answers depend on the garment as well as on just how “custom-made” it r	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Each day, the manager looks over the factory floor to see if any carts with a particular flag color are falling behind the others of that group. [SEP] Delays in product flow can result from machine problems, worker absence, or if priority is given to special orders. [SEP] In some plants, the carts may contain up to a day’s worth of work. [SEP] Although this may appear to be a crude way of keeping track of the work flow, it is simple and generally effective. [SEP] Still, work almost never progresses in perfect lockstep through a factory. [SEP] Finding the correct parts for a shirt can often involve a hunt through the plant. [SEP] For example, a worker might accidentally leave a bundle of unfinished work in the cart when it	go	es back to be loaded again. [SEP] Because a worker may have a day’s work in the carts in front of her, it is easy to see how individual bundles of parts can be misplaced—which, in turn, will hold up the assembly of some SKUs. [SEP] Partially finished shirts and shirt subassemblies will then be in a number of places in the factory. [SEP] This shirt factory employs 250 workers. [SEP] If the shirt in question is rated to require twelve minutes to assemble, such as the one in the figure, a forty-hour work week will produce 4,167 dozen shirts when the factory is operating at standard efficiency. [SEP] (Of course, many plants may fall below the standard and take longer than twelve minutes to make that shirt.)10 A typical time for a shirt to	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
As work progresses through a typical sewing plant, it is also common for a special order to disrupt the flow. [SEP] Even if the special order does not require a thread change, as with most dress shirts, someone will have to move the order to the front of the queue at each sewing station and combine the parts for final assembly. [SEP] We have visited a top-of-the-line men’s suit plant in Sweden where a special order would	go	through the plant in four working days, rather than the normal six weeks, just by allowing the work to	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
 efficient way of operating when the costs of carrying mountains of WIP did not enter into production costs. [SEP] Generally, under this system of apparel assembly all production was made to fill an actual order. [SEP] The risk of inventory was carried by the retailer who placed the order, so apparel operators carried large WIP (in 1988 for our sample an average of 3.65 weeks worth). [SEP] But under rapid replenishment arrangements, the inventory risk is now assumed by the apparel manufacturer; consequently assembly time is now very important. [SEP] As shown in the cases studied in Chapter 7, production-cycle time and inventory carrying costs are two crucial parameters in making rapid replenishment sourcing decisions. [SEP] When the assembly cycle time is reduced, both the WIP and finished	go	ods inventory levels necessary to meet a given rapid replenishment demand	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Despite grim work lives, Rosie and Henry, who had little schooling themselves, sent nine of their children to college and some to graduate school. [SEP] They managed to be involved and caring parents, without all the comforts and time-saving conveniences that we now take for granted—a water-tight roof; central heating; fast foods; microwaves; vacuum cleaners; washing machines and dryers; automobiles; telephones; and much, much more. [SEP] Though Rosie’s and Henry’s way of life was hard, and we shouldn’t	go	too far in romanticizing it, their story helps us put the contemporary time bind in perspective.

How does early experience join with biology to aect brain development? [SEP] The cerebral cortex, seat of human intelligence, under	go	es dramatic growth during the ﬁrst few years. [SEP] Almost all its neurons—cells that store and transmit information—are in place by the second trimester of pregnancy. [SEP] Once established, neurons begin to take on unique functions by sending out branching ﬁbers, which form elaborate connections with other neurons. [SEP] Formation of this complex communication system contributes to an enormous increase in size of the brain—from nearly 30 percent of its adult weight at birth to 70 percent by age 2 and 90 percent by age 6.57 As neurons form connections, a new factor becomes vital in their survival: stimulation. [SEP] Neurons stimulated by the surrounding environment continue to establish new connections, which support more complex functions.

etrimental impact of excessive adult tutoring on young children, described earlier in this chapter. [SEP] They also raise grave concerns about the recent proliferation of expensive commercial early learning centers, in which infants are barraged with letter and number ﬂashcards and slightly older toddlers are drenched in a full curriculum of reading, math, science, art, music, gym, and more.62 [SEP] Rather than optimizing early neurological growth (as proponents claim), these eorts to jump-start young children can inﬂict considerable harm, robbing them of a healthy start on the road to maturity.63 [SEP] Our rapidly expanding knowledge base on brain development and children’s learning reveals that a genetically inﬂuenced roadmap for brain growth and a developmentally appropriate environment	go	hand in hand; the impact of each depends on the other.

To illustrate how Vy	go	tsky envisioned this close connection between social interaction and children’s thinking and behaving, let’s look in on another verbal exchange between a parent and a young child. [SEP] Deb is pulling weeds in the garden while 2 1/2-year-old Maggy follows along, alternately digging with her small spade and holding a toy telephone to her ear. [SEP] Soon gray clouds appear along the horizon, and thunder can be heard. [SEP] Maggy, frightened by the booming sounds, whimpers to Deb, “Scary, Mommy. Go inside!” “That thunder is way up in the sky, far away,” Deb explains, pointing o in the distance. [SEP] “It can’t hurt you. We need to get these weeds out before the rain comes. Just a little longer, and then we’ll	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Maggy listens and responds, “Not scary, far far away,” and Deb nods in agreement. [SEP] As Maggy waits, she paces back and forth near Deb, speaking into her toy phone, “Not scary thunder. Far away. Get the weeds. Not scary, boom boom! Like a big drum.” [SEP] Maggy has taken the communication jointly generated with her mother and turned it toward herself. [SEP] She uses speech derived from that conversation to reﬂect on the thunder, allay her fear, and help her wait until Deb’s task is ﬁnished and they can	go	inside. [SEP] As Maggy “thinks aloud” with words, she converses with herself, in much the same way that she interacted with her mother. [SEP] Over time, Maggy will start to interact with herself silently, “inside her head.” [SEP] And as Maggie’s social experiences expand and become more complex, she will continue to weave aspects of them into her inner dialogues, acquiring new, more advanced ways of thinking. [SEP] A ﬁnal point about thinking as internalized social interaction: Note that Maggy’s telephone conversation with herself is not a simple copy of Deb’s remarks to her. [SEP] The sociocultural vision is very dierent from behaviorism, which views development as directly imposed, or shaped, by external forces. [SEP] Instead, children are active agents, contributing to the creation of th	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
beings who must be urged toward independence. [SEP] In response to researchers’ queries, they frequently say that babies should be trained to be self-reliant from the ﬁrst few months.1 [SEP] Consequently, they place a high value on children’s learning and doing on their own. [SEP] Repeatedly relying on others for assistance is construed as weakness, uncertainty, and lack of capacity. [SEP] In keeping with this view, many American parents worry that if their children seek help, they may become dependent. [SEP] A similar view permeates traditional classrooms, where an individualistic value system prevails. [SEP] Children must “do their own work.” [SEP] In the most intensely individualistic of these settings, conferring with your neighbor is worse than dependency; it is cheating, and teachers	go	so far as to set up barriers between pupils, such as upright books and cardboard screens, to prevent it. [SEP] This emphasis on independent accomplishment is not broadly accepted around the world. [SEP] Indeed, adults in some non-Western cultures regard American parents as rather merciless in pushing their young children toward independence—for example, when they insist that infants sleep alone rather than with their parents, or when they take pleasure in the earliest possible mastery of motor skills, such as crawling and walking, long before the child has acquired the reasoning powers to avoid steep staircases and busy roadways.2	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1

1. Joint Problem Solving, Aimed at Keeping the Child in the “Zone.” [SEP] Sydney and her father collaborate in overcoming obstacles that Sydney encounters. [SEP] In doing so, father and daughter jointly work toward successful puzzle solution. [SEP] Sydney’s father keeps the task within Sydney’s “zone” by temporarily reducing the diculty of the puzzle. [SEP] He does so by breaking the task into smaller units, focusing Sydney’s attention on the lower section—the part with the largest and most easily matched pieces. [SEP] Then he assists with a general prompt, “Which piece might	go	down here?” [SEP] When Sydney’s father observes that this suggestion is not sucient for her to succeed, he oers additional support, “Find a piece that looks like this shape and matches this color” and “Turn it.” [SEP] His statements contain strategies (attending to color and shape, patiently adjusting pieces so they ﬁt) that Sydney can use in future attempts. [SEP] When Sydney experiments with the color-matching strategy and succeeds in placing the brown piece, she internalizes the technique. [SEP] She applies it in subsequent eorts, regulating her behavior with self-directed language resembling her father’s communication during joint problem solving. [SEP] Consequently, Sydney begins to move toward independent solving of the puzzle.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
When adults ask children questions and make suggestions that permit them to participate in the discovery of solutions, then transfer of useful strategies to the child is maximized. [SEP] By introducing language as a mediator of the child’s activity, the adult’s questions and prompts prevent the child from responding impulsively. [SEP] They encourage the child to step back from the immediate situation and consider alternatives—in essence, to think. [SEP] Look at Sydney and her father’s dialogue once again. [SEP] When he asks, “Which piece might	go	down here?” he evokes Sydney’s present strategic thinking, ﬁnding that it is still tied to immediate objects in the situation. [SEP] Sydney looks for the clown’s shoes but fails to ﬁnd them. [SEP] Then her father introduces a special form of strategic thinking called distancing.

At times, adults tell children stories that carry important self-relevant lessons. [SEP] For example, recently I listened in as a father and his 5-year-old son waited in the foyer of a syna	go	gue for a Jewish New Year service to begin.

[SEP] Little Chaim had a brand new whistle in his back pocket, and he badly wanted to play it.

“I can’t remember much family togetherness when I was a kid,” Hannah remarked. [SEP] “Our parents couldn’t talk things out with each other, and they rarely talked things out with us. Mom took Sarah and me to Girl Scouts, swimming, piano, and other lessons. We enjoyed the activities and the friends we made, but they couldn’t compensate for what was missing: warm, family time. We almost never sat down to a meal together or went places together; we each went our own way.

 Fulfillment and Insight into Social Roles Freud regarded make-believe play as a form of pleasurable wish fulﬁllment that allows children to act out uncertainties, anxieties, and hoped for outcomes and, therefore, to master frightening and frustrating events. [SEP] Young children, Freud noted, often revisit anxiety-provoking experiences, such as a trip to the doctor’s office or discipline by a parent, but with roles reversed so the child is in command and compensates for unpleasant happenings. [SEP] Sophie’s parents, aware of the previous day’s events, might have judged her pretend focus on bedtime, lollipops, and paciﬁers to contain at least an element of wish fulﬁllment. [SEP] The evening before, they had told her, “Only one lolly from the candy dish,” and she had complained at having to	go	to bed while her parents continued to talk and laugh with their guests. [SEP] Psychoanalyst Erik Erikson built on Freud’s vision, expanding his picture of make-believe. [SEP] According to Erikson, children draw on fantasy play to ﬁnd out about themselves and their social world.1 [SEP] In all cultures, children act out family roles and highly visible occupations—police officer, doctor, and nurse in our society; rabbit hunter and potter among the Hopi Indians; and hut builder and spear maker among the Baka of West Africa.2 [SEP] As they do so, they enter a small social organization whose members must cooperate to achieve common	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Had Vy	go	tsky lived long enough to become familiar with Erik Erikson’s psychoanalytic theory, he would have agreed that make-believe play teaches children about social roles and provides them with insights into what they can become in their society.

Children’s imaginative play, Vy	go	tsky pointed out, contains an interesting paradox. [SEP] In play, preschoolers seem to do what they most feel like doing, and to an outside observer, their play appears free and spontaneous. [SEP] Nevertheless, pretend play demands that children act against their immediate impulses because they must subject themselves to the rules of the make-believe scene.13 [SEP] A child pretending to	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
In this sense, make-believe is not really “free play,” as we often assume it to be. [SEP] Instead, its very essence is self-restraint—voluntarily following social rules. [SEP] While pretending, Vy	go	tsky explained, children repeatedly face conﬂicts between the rules of the make-believe situation and what they would do if they could act impulsively, and they usually decide in favor of the rules. [SEP] When tired, Sophie’s teddy bear and leprechaun don’t stay up late doing just as they please.

Furthermore, children acting out stories during pretend play are assisted in mastering the storytelling script, or basic framework of story organization. [SEP] Preschoolers’ pretend scenarios are often quite storylike, consisting of characters, settings, and plot sequences that include adventure, suspense, surprise, conﬂict, and resolution. [SEP] Witness the following trip to Sea World, during which Emily and her friends save Baby Shamu from danger: S: (to Emily) Would you come with us? [SEP] Let’s	go	to Sea World. [SEP] E: Sea World!

Vital Features of Adult–Child Play How should parents, caregivers, and teachers	go	about engaging young children in make-believe?

[SEP] In fostering play, adults might have explicit	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
onstrations and suggestions. [SEP] In support of this approach, psychologist Barbara Fiese’s observations of mothers playing with their 15- to 24-month-olds revealed that maternal questions, directions, and intrusions (initiating a new activity unrelated to the child’s current play) led to immature behavior in which toddlers merely mouthed, touched, and looked at toys. [SEP] Relentlessly barraging children with information that communicates “at” rather than “with” them fails to involve them in dialogue and interferes with optimum development of play. [SEP] In contrast, turn-taking and joint involvement, in which mothers sustained or expanded on their child’s play themes, evoked high levels of pretending.68 [SEP] Maternal interactions that suggest play options related to 1 1/2-year-olds’ on	go	ing activity—for example, saying “Oh, is the doll trying to swim?” as the child puts a doll into a toy cup—continue to predict extended make-believe sequences and imaginative object substitutions at age 3.

This does not mean that parents should never express anger at or punish a child. [SEP] An otherwise warm parent who is disappointed and disapproving lets the child know that the transgression is serious. [SEP] When children realize that adults regard their misdeed as very important, they listen more closely.20 [SEP] And punishment is warranted after repeated infractions. [SEP] But parents have far better ways to punish than spanking. [SEP] One of these is time out—requiring a child to sit aside or to	go	to his or her room. [SEP] Another is withdrawal of privileges, such as a visit to the playground or a weekly allowance. [SEP] These mild punishments derive their potency from warm parent–child bonds. [SEP] Children of involved, caring parents ﬁnd the interruption in parental affection that accompanies punishment to be very unpleasant. [SEP] As a result, they want to regain the warmth and approval of the parent as quickly as possible. [SEP] An important preventive of misbehavior—and a vital element of effective punishment—is explanation. [SEP] Pairing reasons with mild punishment (such as time out) leads to a far greater reduction in rule violations than using punishment alone.21 [SEP] The reason the adult gives the child must match the child’s capacity to understand.

gin preschool or child care, they are more susceptible to otitis media because of close contact with other children. [SEP] Therefore, frequent screening for the disease, followed by prompt medical intervention, is vital. [SEP] Interestingly, verbally stimulating adult–child interaction and high-quality child care help reduce developmental problems associated with otitis media.44 [SEP] When adults converse often with children and keep environmental noise to a minimum, children with persistent ear infections have more opportunities to hear and respond to spoken language. [SEP] I’m trying to decide whether to enroll my 5-year-old son in kindergarten or wait until next year. [SEP] How can I tell if he’s ready for kindergarten? [SEP] If he doesn’t do well in kindergarten, should he repeat it or	go	into a “transition” class? [SEP] Many parents struggle with the decision of whether to enroll their child in kindergarten once the child meets the age requirements. [SEP] Most often, they consider delaying the start of school for boys, who as a group tend to lag behind girls in cognitive and social development. [SEP] At the heart of parents’ concern is whether their child will be able to meet the academic and social demands of the kindergarten classroom.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Is learning and development affected if the father becomes less involved or absent after a divorce? [SEP] Divorce is invariably painful for children, and learning and development can be affected—temporarily and long term.73 [SEP] Preschool and young school-age children are often profoundly upset. [SEP] Because they have great difficulty grasping the reasons for their parents’ divorce, they may blame themselves and take the marital breakup as a sign that they could be abandoned by both parents. [SEP] As a result, they may cry and cling, refuse to	go	to school, and show a drop in enthusiasm for play and learning. [SEP] Young children need extra affection and reassurance along with gentle reminders that their parents’ separation is permanent. [SEP] Of all age groups, preschoolers are most likely to have trouble accepting the reality of divorce and to fantasize that their parents will get back together.74 [SEP] Many school-age children and adolescents also react strongly to the end of their parents’ marriage, particularly when family conﬂict is high and parent involvement with children is low. [SEP] Around the time of divorce and for up to several years after, children tend to be emotionally volatile, displaying both depression and demandingness, noncompliance, and aggression.75 [SEP] Boys in mother-custody families seem to have the harde	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] He appeared at Christmastime to test and discipline children who did not know their catechism or prayers.

[SEP] Children were terribly frightened because of his horrid appearance. [SEP] Instead of a mask he sometimes had a tortilla plastered on his face, wore buffalo horns and a horsetail, and of course carried the whip.

 by parents and grandparents. [SEP] A riddle is an intellectual brainteaser, in Spanish called a quebracabeza; facts are framed in the form of a question in such a way that the respondent cannot possibly know the answer. [SEP] An example in Spanish is, “Qué camina de cuatro patas por la mañana, dos patas en el medio día, y tres patas en la noche?” (What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night?) The answer is man, who as a child, in the “morning” of life, crawls on four legs; as an adult walks on two legs; and as an old man uses a cane for support, thus walking on three legs. [SEP] Another example is a “true riddle,” which is a comparison of something to the unknown answer, and that something is described in the question. [SEP] For example, “Ten	go	ojos y no miro; boca pero no hablo; qué soy?” (I have eyes and cannot see; a mouth, but cannot speak; What am I?) The answer is a photograph. [SEP] Another type of riddle is the conundrum, where the answer is contained in the riddle itself, such as “Agua pasa por mi casa cate de mi corazon” (Water passes by my house pain of my heart).

alaveras during the period of the presidency of Porfirio Díaz and during the Mexican Revolution. [SEP] He introduced the humorous satirical calavera that showed the objectionable side of life, that engaged in regular daily activities such as eating, dancing, drinking, fighting, enjoying life, and being a regular Mexican. [SEP] The Mexican concept of death is exemplified in the satiric antics of the calavera and this perspective is also found in the art, literature, and performance arts of Chicanos. [SEP] Calaveras are depicted dancing, drinking in cantinas (bars), crowding and falling out of buses, and playing instruments in musical groups. [SEP] El Teatro Campesino in its performances always has a calavera character that either represents La Muerte (death) or typifies a disturbing alter e	go	of one of the main characters. [SEP] A Mexican tradition of the late nineteenth century was the publication of a poetic broadside that was called a calavera. [SEP] Published before or during the festivities of Día de los Muertos, these calaveras carried poems that poked fun at socially prominent people such as politicians and the very wealthy. [SEP] Some calaveras, such as the poems, were printed in newspapers, but most were small pamphlets or single sheets that were sold on the street.

The prodigious amount of published literature about La Llorona, by folklorists, literary critics, anthropologists, and feminist writers, attests to the complexity of the legend. [SEP] Children’s books, short stories, novels, and films have been created based on this basic story of infanticide and repentance. [SEP] We find narratives in rural and urban areas of the Southwest, on college campuses, in juvenile halls, in large cities of the Midwest such as Chica	go	, and among the native populations of Mexico. [SEP] Many Chicanos see themselves as orphans of La Llorona, as the lost children of the marriage between the Aztecs and the Spanish Conquerors. [SEP] She is a beloved female archetype among contemporary Chicanas, who write poems, short stories, and academic research articles about her.

ence of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to come to the United States. [SEP] Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos, with the same prejudicial meaning as “greaser” or “spic.” [SEP] Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants. [SEP] Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called “wets.” [SEP] Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels. [SEP] In Mexico, the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas, a literal translation for the word wetback. [SEP] In 1955 a well--established Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas, which intended to persuade Mexicans not to	go	to the United States. [SEP] It was a political film that incorporated all of the standard characters that would appear in countless other films and novels of the Chicano experience: the wetback, the pocho (half Mexican), the coyote (smuggler) who smuggles people into the United States, and the grower Mister Sterling. [SEP] An ironic, yet justified ending shows Mister Sterling dumped into the Rio Grande by Mexicans, and as he swims to the U.S. side of the border he is shot by the Border Patrol.

ber of 1974 as a means of developing cooperation and communication for the artists working throughout California. [SEP] The early murals were considered public folk art because of the common themes of community and civil rights and because most of the murals were located in working-class neighborhoods and urban barrios. [SEP] Often, these early murals were referred to as a people’s art. [SEP] This concept was well expressed by a group of women artists in San Francisco who called themselves Mujeres Muralistas (women muralists). [SEP] “Our interest as artists is to put art close to where it needs to be. Close to the children; close to the old people; close to everyone who has to walk or ride the buses to get places. We want our art either out in the streets or in places where a lot of people	go	each day, the hospitals, health centers, clinics, restaurants, and other public places” (Cockcroft, Weber, and Cockcroft, 107). [SEP] The scenes of many early Chicano murals consisted of pre-Columbian indigenous themes and motifs that reflected a mestizo (mixed-race) heritage and a Mexican cultural nationalism. [SEP] Images of Aztlán, a concept from the pre--Conquest, and other Aztec symbols represented cultural pride and national loyalty. [SEP] Chicano and Chicana artists turned to symbols that portrayed the traditions of Chicanos, traditions that distinguished them from mainstream American culture. [SEP] These images can still be found in murals located in Chicano communities across the United States.

The first and for many years the one considered most -authentic was by John Rollin Ridge, serialized in the California Police Gazette and eventually published under the title of The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murrieta, the Celebrated California Bandit in 1854. [SEP] John Rollin Ridge, a Cherokee also known as Yellow Bird, wrote his story one year after the death of Murrieta. [SEP] This is the basic story of Joaquín that all subsequent histories are based on. [SEP] In 1859 the California Police Gazette printed Ridge’s story in ten installments and this publicity helped to further disseminate the story. [SEP] The book was translated into French and Spanish and for many years it was better known abroad than in this country. [SEP] In doubting the details of the Murrieta legend, researchers	go	back to Ridge’s version, which some say was based on newspaper stories about the various bandits named Joaquín. [SEP] It is believed by some researchers that Ridge just applied the name Murrieta to the Joaquín that was finally captured and decapitated. [SEP] As a Native American, Ridge identified with the discriminatory treatment of California Mexicans, and he stated that he wanted to do justice to the Mexicans. [SEP] Joaquín Murrieta’s life has been depicted in novels, stories, newspaper serials, and movies. [SEP] Charles E. B. Howe wrote a play about Joaquín in 1859 that covers his escapades from the spring of 1851 to July 24, 1853, the day he was captured and killed by Captain Harry Love.

Oso, Juan The name of a folk character found in tales collected in Spain and New Mexico by Aurelio Espinosa and his son, Jose Manuel Espinosa. [SEP] In some tales Juan Oso (John Bear) is the son of a princess and a bear. [SEP] The princess is kidnapped by a bear when she is out of the palace and is taken to a cave where she eventually has a son who is half bear and half human. [SEP] Finally she and Juan Osito, her son, are able to run away from the bear and	go	live in the palace with her father. [SEP] After Juan grows up he leaves his mother to wander the land, and from this point on, various tales describe the different adventures of Juan Oso. [SEP] In a variant of the tale, a young woman and her baby son are captured by a bear and taken to live in a cave where the son grows up learning the ways of the bear. [SEP] They also escape and return to live with the woman’s uncle, and Juan Oso wanders off to explore the world. [SEP] Even though he is half wild, Juan Oso develops into a strong, smart, and sensitive man who will not be outwitted.

folk play. [SEP] Also known as La Pastorela, the complete title of this folk drama is El Coloquio de los Pastores, and it is written in verse and performed on Christmas Eve. [SEP] It is an ancient mystery play, brought to the New World by the Spanish Franciscan priests, and is performed throughout the Southwest. [SEP] As a folk production, it is performed for entertainment, but it is also a religious presentation that is maintaining a long tradition. [SEP] The full title means “the dialogue of the shepherds,” and it is an interpretation of the dialogue and reaction the shepherds may have had when they learned of the birth of Jesus Christ. [SEP] It narrates the story of the shepherds who are visited by Michael the Archangel who informs them of the birth of the infant Jesus and urges them to	go	to Belén (Bethlehem). [SEP] Before the shepherds decide what to do, they are visited by Lucifer, who is angry about the birth of the Christ child to the Virgin Mary. [SEP] Lucifer tries to challenge the shepherds but Michael the Archangel returns just in time to defeat him. [SEP] The shepherds then continue on their journey to Bethlehem bringing gifts for the infant Jesus. [SEP] The structure of the play is formulaic, and so the sequence of acts can be rearranged into many different patterns, with jokes, songs, speeches, and other events added at different points.

Lochner ranks among the more widely scorned decisions of the Supreme Court. [SEP] The general complaint is that the Court ignored the interest of the state in furthering the health and welfare of its citizens. [SEP] To put this objection in other terms, the opinion ignored the ascendancy of the tripartite conception of	go	vernment. [SEP] The issue remains with us—if only in a slightly different guise. [SEP] Since the late 1930s, the principle of freedom of contract has given way to the propriety of the state and federal measures to protect working people on the job. [SEP] Yet, the question of liberty and its potential abuse in an oppressive relationship remains a flash point of debate. [SEP] Although the concept is not mentioned in the Constitution, the freedom to say “yes” or “no” to particular commercial relationships has become an essential dimension of personhood. [SEP] It is as much a part of the basic liberty protected under the due process clause as the right to be free from unjustified physical restraint.

Freedom of contract enables individuals to express their personhood, but it also facilitates relationships of oppression, including “slavery and involuntary servitude.” [SEP] After all, it is possible to choose to enter into a contract of slavery. [SEP] The book of Exodus permits the purchase of a Hebrew slave, but after six years of service “he shall	go	out free, for nothing.”10 Yet, there are people, the Bible recognizes, who prefer the condition of servitude: And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master . . . I will not	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
ple, the servant chooses the condition of servitude. [SEP] We know from the fate of many long-term prisoners that after a certain period they choose a life of dependence, free of the responsibility of caring for themselves. [SEP] It is not impossible that someone might actually prefer the secure life of the slave to the anxious life of the free person who must care for himself. [SEP] There are two distinct grounds on which the law might sensibly prohibit the possibility recognized in Exodus. [SEP] First, the claim might be that freedom and its blessings represent a great gift that no individual “made in God’s image” should be able to forfeit as though it were a disposable piece of property. [SEP] Alternatively, the argument might be that in principle people have the right to choose to fore	go	their freedom, but that in reality these choices are always influenced by personal necessities that becloud the choice actually made. [SEP] This is especially true under market conditions, where the need for sustenance can drive people into relationships that they would not choose in and of themselves. [SEP] It is clear that even the choice of the Hebrew slave discussed in Exodus can never be shown to be completely free. [SEP] The legal arrangements also stipulate in the same passage that if during his period of servitude the slave acquired a wife or children, then he must leave them behind when he leaves his master’s service. [SEP] Some purchased servants might decide to opt for permanent servitude simply because they cannot bear to live without their wives and family.

Equality appears as a central theme in the virtue of justice as well as friendship. [SEP] The just person is one who pays due regard to his own interests as well as to those of others. [SEP] He is able to maintain the proper balance between his own interests and those of others. [SEP] This is an aspect of distributive justice that generally requires each person to receive a due or proportionate share of the	go	od to be distributed. [SEP] Aristotle describes this proportion as an expression of geometric equality. [SEP] Similarly, when one person wrongs another, some correction is necessary. [SEP] This species of justice is also based on equality, understood arithmetically. [SEP] The wrongdoer and the victim should both be restored to the state they were in prior to the wrong. [SEP] This might be done by compelling the wrongdoer to pay compensation from the gains that he has received in order to make up the loss to the victim. [SEP] These virtues of friendship and justice require cultivation, for they contribute to the flourishing of the virtuous individual.

The idea of human dignity, which we now take to be a shared premise of Western civilization, became the backdrop for our current faith in human rights and crimes against humanity. [SEP] The Fourteenth Amendment is our placeholder in the evolution of egalitarian thinking. [SEP] We know very little about how much equality the framers of the amendment intended to secure, and frankly it does not matter. [SEP] Each generation must struggle to assay how far they are willing to	go	in the name of egalitarian justice or, by contrast, how far they wish to surrender to the surviving counter-values of hierarchy. [SEP] In the aftermath of the Civil War it was clear, ironically, that black men were far ahead of white women in ascending the scale of egalitarian possibilities. [SEP] Black men acquired, at least nominally, both the right to vote and the right to serve on juries. [SEP] White women and black women alike would acquire neither until well into the twentieth century.

 Judge Ito made the right decision to let the families stay in court.

[SEP] The typical pattern is to allow the victim to join the proceedings either as a civil plaintiff suing simultaneously for tort damages or as a coprosecutor arguing and presenting the case alongside the state prosecutor.

[SEP] Many of us have now explored the application of Bak’s ideas in models of coevolution that I will discuss shortly. [SEP] With caveats that other explanations may account for the data, the general result is that something may occur that is like a theory of coevolutionary assembly that yields a self-organized critical biosphere with a power law distribution of small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events. [SEP] As we shall see, the best data now suggest that precisely such a power law distribution of extinction and speciation events has occurred over the past 650 million years of the Phanerozoic. [SEP] In addition, the same body of theory predicts that most species	go	extinct soon after their formation, while some live a long time.

ith an idealized “working gas,” which can be compressed and can expand. [SEP] As a real, and certainly an idealized, gas is compressed, the gas becomes hotter; as the gas expands, it becomes cooler. [SEP] I will modify the Carnot machine in one central way, which does not alter but rather makes explicit an important feature of the actual working of the Carnot machine. [SEP] I will attach a red handle to the cylinder, as shown in Figure 3.1. [SEP] The Carnot cycle begins with the piston pressed up near the top of the cylinder, the working gas is compressed and hot, indeed, it is as hot as the high temperature T1. [SEP] You will operate the machine. [SEP] You pull on the red handle, sliding the cylinder (frictionlessly) into contact with the high-temperature reservoir, T1. [SEP] You then let	go	of the red handle and allow the working gas in the cylinder to expand, thereby pushing the piston downward away from the head of the cylinder, in the first part of the power stroke of the Carnot engine. [SEP] As the power stroke initiates, the working gas expands and starts to cool. [SEP] However, thanks to the fact that the cylinder is now in contact with the hot thermal reservoir, heat flows into the cylinder from T1 and maintains the working gas almost at the constant temperature T1. [SEP] Indeed, if the Carnot engine is operated slowly enough, the temperature remains constant. [SEP] Such slow operation is said to be reversible. [SEP] If the engine is operated more rapidly, hence irreversibly, the temperature is held nearly constant during this part of the power stroke, thus this section	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
y-axis corresponds to the pressure of the gas (Figure 3.2). [SEP] The work cycle began with the piston near the top of the cylinder, the working gas hot and compressed. [SEP] As the isothermal expansion phase of the power stroke happens, the pressure falls slightly, while the volume increases appreciably. [SEP] The corresponding segment of the work cycle connects the starting position in Figure 3.2, position 1, to position 2 by a line segment representing the simultaneous values of volume and pressure during the isothermal expansion part of the power stroke. [SEP] You initiate the second part of the power stroke by pushing on the handle and moving the cylinder out of contact with the hot T1 reservoir to a position between the two heat reservoirs, touching neither. [SEP] You immediately let	go	of the handle. [SEP] The working gas continues to expand, pushing downward on the piston and moving it away from the head of the cylinder. [SEP] However, because the cylinder is out of contact with T1 and the working gas is expanding, the working gas gets noticeably cooler, so pressure drops appreciably while volume increases slightly. [SEP] This part of the power stroke is called “adiabatic expansion.” [SEP] In Figure 3.2, the adiabatic expansion step carries the system from step 2 to step 3, the end of the power stroke, a point where the pressure is at the lowest point, and the volume of the working gas is at the highest point of the work cycle.

It is helpful to attempt to formalize the concept of the adjacent possible. [SEP] I will do so using classical physics and the now familiar concept of a N-dimensional phase space. [SEP] Recall that our particles in the liter box had three positional variables and three momenta, or velocity variables, hence, six numbers per particle. [SEP] For an N particle system, this is the familiar N-dimensional phase space. [SEP] Let’s just	go	ahead and define the classical N-dimensional phase space for a region of real space, including the sphere centered on the Earth out to twice the orbit of the moon and containing the positions and momenta of all particles from the Earth out to twice the orbit of the moon. [SEP] Physicists always assure us that this makes sense. [SEP] As usual, we can break this classical N-dimensional phase space into a very large number of tiny “cells,” each also N-dimensional. [SEP] At any moment, the Earth-centered N system, call it the “Earth system,” is in one of these tiny cells, or microstates. [SEP] Over time, the Earth system  or a larger one including the entire solar system or our galaxy or the local cluster of galaxies  flows from microstate to microstate.

It is interesting that the same feature may occur in the economy as a whole. [SEP] We hear of future shock. [SEP] Roughly, what we fear is that the rate of technological change will overwhelm us. [SEP] But will it? [SEP] Or is there a self-regulating mechanism that gates our rate of entry into the technological adjacent possible? [SEP] The latter, I think. [SEP] Consider this: Why does an innovation get itself introduced? [SEP] Because someone thinks he or she can make money introducing that innovation. [SEP] But if the person or firm making the innovation and introducing it to the global or village markets faced a product life cycle that was so very rapid that neither they nor others in the economy could absorb the innovations and make livings, the firms in question would	go	broke. [SEP] We will only broach the technological adjacent possible at that rate at which we can make a living doing so. [SEP] We gate our entry into the technological future. [SEP] Thus, it appears that the biosphere and the econosphere have endogenous mechanisms that gate the exploration of the adjacent possible such that, on average, such explorations do successfully find new ways of making a living, new natural and business games, at a rate that can be selected by natural selection, or its economic analogue of success or failure, at a rate that is sustainable. [SEP] It is a further plausible hypothesis that the rate of exploration of the adjacent possible endogenously converges to the rate that is maximally sustainable.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Now, states is very very small compared to ,. [SEP] The overwhelming order of the ordered regime, I believe, keeps cells from wandering all over their state spaces for eternities beyond eternities. [SEP] In fact, it takes about one to ten minutes to turn a eukaryotic gene on or o, so it would take a cell from to , minutes, or from about . [SEP] hours to about hours, to traverse its state cycle attractor. [SEP] This is right in the biological ballpark. [SEP] For example, the cell division cycle of dierent human cell types is in the range of to hours. [SEP] By contrast, in the chaotic regime state cycle lengths scale exponentially with the size of the network. [SEP] The deepest one can	go	into the chaotic regime is to assign at random the successor state for each state. [SEP] In that case, in general, each gene is a Boolean function of all N genes. [SEP] In this case, the typical state cycle length is the square root of the number of states in the state space.

The results are shown in Figure .. Indeed, landscape ruggedness does evolve to an intermediate ruggedness.

In addition, when Godzilla’ replaces the hapless species that now	go	es extinct, its econeighbors find themselves interacting with Godzilla’ itself.

The bounded complexity issues would seem to apply to any coevolving autonomous agents that are able to make theories of one another and base actions on those theories. [SEP] The tiger chasing the gazelle and the starfish predating the trilobite are, we suppose, Popperian creatures able to formulate hypotheses about their worlds that may sometimes die in their stead. [SEP] Presumably all such autonomous agents, under persistent mutation and selection, would opt for changeable models of one another of bounded complexity.

[SEP] Whatever natural, or unnatural, games autonomous agents are playing as they and we coevolve in a biosphere or econo-sphere, nonstationarity arises on many levels.

[SEP] At 9:00, Lee Hanson received a second call from his son Peter: It's getting bad, Dad-A stewardess was stabbed-They seem to have knives and Mace-They said they have a bomb-It's getting very bad on the plane-Passengers are throwing up and getting sick-The plane is making jerky movements-I don't think the pilot is flying the plane-I think we are	go	ing down-I think they intend to	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1

At 9:36, the FAA's Boston Center called NEADS and relayed the discovery about an unidentified aircraft closing in on Washington:"Latest report. Aircraft VFR [visual flight rules] six miles southeast of the White House. . . . Six, southwest. Six, southwest of the White House, deviating away." [SEP] This startling news prompted the mission crew commander at NEADS to take immediate control of the airspace to clear a flight path for the Langley fighters:"Okay, we're	go	ing to turn it . . . crank it up. . . . Run them to the White House." [SEP] He then discovered, to his surprise, that the Langley fighters were not headed north toward the Baltimore area as instructed, but east over the ocean. [SEP] " I don't care how many windows you break," he said. [SEP] " Damn it. . . . Okay. Push them back." [SEP] The Langley fighters were heading east, not north, for three reasons. [SEP] First, unlike a normal scramble order, this order did not include a distance to the target or the target's location. [SEP] Second, a "generic" flight plan-prepared to get the aircraft airborne and out of local airspace quickly-incorrectly led the Langley fighters to believe they were ordered to fly due east (090) for 60 miles. [SEP] Third, the lead pilot and local FAA controller incor	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
At 9:42, the Command Center learned from news reports that a plane had struck the Penta	go	n. [SEP] The Command Center's national operations manager, Ben Sliney, ordered all FAA facilities to instruct all aircraft to land at the nearest airport. [SEP] This was an unprecedented order. [SEP] The air traffic control system handled it with great skill, as about 4,500 commercial and general aviation aircraft soon landed without incident. [SEP] At 9:46 the Command Center updated FAA headquarters that United 93 was now "twenty-nine minutes out of Washington, D.C." [SEP] At 9:49, 13 minutes after Cleveland Center had asked about getting military help, the Command Center suggested that someone at headquarters should decide whether to request military assistance: FAA Headquarters: They're pulling Jeff away to	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
The President's motorcade departed at 9:35, and arrived at the airport between 9:42 and 9:45. [SEP] During the ride the President learned about the attack on the Penta	go	n. [SEP] He boarded the aircraft, asked the Secret Service about the safety of his family, and called the Vice President. [SEP] According to notes of the call, at about 9:45 the President told the Vice President:"Sounds like we have a minor war	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
By 1998, Bin Ladin had a distinctive appeal, as he focused on attacking America. [SEP] He argued that other extremists, who aimed at local rulers or Israel, did not	go	far enough. [SEP] They had not taken on what he called "the head of the snake."	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-2.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
He had to make other adjustments as well, for some al Qaeda members viewed Bin Ladin's return to Afghanistan as occasion to	go	off in their own directions.

[SEP] The stables at Amsterdam Bos offer woodland rides, a perfect way to clear the city air from your system (contact Manege de Amsterdamse; Tel. 643 1432).

Perched on the edge of the Bairro Alto is the Igreja do Carmo, devastated in the earthquake of 1755 but deliberately preserved as an atmospheric ruin and potent reminder of its impact. [SEP] Nearby, the sumptuous, 16th-century Igreja de São Roque, features a small museum of sacred art. [SEP] You can walk to this area easily from the central squares, but it’s also fun to	go	by tram or instead to board the landmark 30-meter (98-foot) Elevador de Santa Justa, which you’ll find just off the Rossio square in the Baixa, the lower city. [SEP] This 1902 Victorian marvel of iron and glass was built by Raul Mesnier.

[SEP] The Baixa is Lisbon’s principal business district. [SEP] The main square is the Praça Dom Pedro IV, better known as the Rossio.

ckeplein and you will see a suitably somber statue of Johan Rudolf Thorbecke who designed the Dutch constitution in 1848. [SEP] Wander through the square, which hosts an art market on Sundays, to reach Rembrandtsplein, one of the city’s most vibrant social centers. [SEP] Before 1878 this square was called Botermarkt, (a butter market was held here in the 19th century) but the square was renamed after the large statue of Rembrandt was sited here. [SEP] One wonders what he would have made of the square, for since the statue was unveiled, it has attracted theaters, cinemas, clubs, and show halls, along with a plethora of bars and restaurants and a curtain of vibrant neon signs all around the façade. [SEP] On a summer evening it is one of the best places to sit with a drink and watch the world	go	by, and is within easy reach of a romantic walk along the canalsides. [SEP] Beyond the eastern end of Waterlooplein you will see the Visserplein, busy with several lanes of traffic. [SEP] Head across the square to Weesperstraat to find the Joods Historisch Museum (Jewish Historical Museum) which documents the history of the once large and influential Jewish community in the city. [SEP] Jewish history dates back to the late 16th century, but was cut short by the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam in 1940. [SEP] The systematic deportation of the Jewish population to concentration camps destroyed the community and after the war only a handful of the thousands forced to leave returned to their homes.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
The Rijksmuseum Pride of place must	go	to the Rijksmuseum (The National Art Gallery) with arguably the greatest collection of Dutch art in the world. [SEP] The collection is housed in a magnificent Victorian Gothic building, especially designed for it by P. J. H. Cuypers, which was opened in 1885. [SEP] The museum can be a confusing maze of connecting rooms — additions were completed in 1898 and 1919 — so it pays to sit down for a few minutes to study the very comprehensive map, which accompanies your ticket. [SEP] A multimedia interactive study area also allows you to review the vast collection on a screen, pinpoint works which you want to see, and print out further details of each piece.

At the end of the fifth century b.c., Greece entered the period of the Persian Wars, as recorded in Herodotus’ great narrative history of the ancient world (see page 33). [SEP] The Persian Empire’s far-flung lands included a number of Greek settlements on the coast of what is now Turkey. [SEP] When the Greek towns attempted a revolt in 499 b.c., Athens sent an expedition to aid their uprising. [SEP] The revolt failed, but the Persian king, Darius, could not let such impudence	go	unpunished, and in 490 b.c. he confidently launched an invasion of Attica. [SEP] Although the Persians’ forces and resources were vastly superior, Darius hadn’t anticipated the amazing courage and battlefield skill of the Greeks. [SEP] A fleet of around 600 Persian vessels landed troops at Marathon beach. [SEP] Led by General Miltiades, the Athenians inflicted a crippling and humiliating defeat on the Persians. [SEP] According to legend, the soldier who ran from Marathon to Athens — a distance of 42 km (26 miles) — to report the victory then died of exhaustion.

[SEP] Take a right down Lampraki to reach the pretty harbor of Zea. [SEP] This is one of the marinas used for pleasure craft, and where Athenians — rich and not so rich — moor their boats.

The Bahamian people are among the friendliest you’ll ever meet, and they are eager to share the homeland they love with visitors. [SEP] The population is a fascinating mixture of descendants of the Loyalist settlers who left America after the American Revolution, freedom lovers who escaped religious persecution, and ex-slaves set free following emancipation. [SEP] This mixture, which could have produced a society fraught with problems, has evolved into a gentle, sociable, and happy people, proud of their homeland and the progress they have made since independence in 1973. [SEP] With a stable economy,	go	od health, and no taxes, it’s no wonder that a smile comes naturally to all Bahamians. [SEP] All the communities still have strong religious faith, the pretty churches are full on Sundays, and a conversation about some future event always ends with “…God willing” or “…with the Lord’s blessing.” [SEP] To make the most of your trip you’ll need to tune your mind to “Bahamian time.” [SEP] On New Providence and Grand Bahama this may not be much slower than at home, but on the Out Islands, time definitely runs more slowly, and nothing is so important that it can’t wait a while. [SEP] People are more important than to-do lists, so a leisurely exchange of greetings and an inquiry about your family’s well-being precedes any business activity.

her destinations — especially on the more populated Out Islands. [SEP] Rentals can vary from small runabouts that will get you around the harbor and the coastal shallows to large sailing yachts and motor launches for inter-island expeditions. [SEP] Rates vary enormously. [SEP] To make more of a stay in the Abacos or Exumas, where there are many outlaying cays, you can rent a 18-ft (51⁄2-m) boat with small outboard motor for around $80 per day. [SEP] Larger vessels come with a crew and/or guide; if you sail your own boat, you can take advantage of the services of a local guide to take you to fishing, snorkeling, or dive sites. [SEP] The Abacos are most popular spot for sailing, primarily because of the many sheltered harbors and the many islands and cays that you can reach without having to	go	outside of the reefs and into ocean waters. [SEP] If you want to get out and see a lot of boats without doing any sailing, head to the Bahamas during the Regattas, when boats crowd the harbors and the little towns are full of yachtsmen. [SEP] Listen to the stories of heroic deeds in the bars and enjoy the wonderful views of masts filling the skies. [SEP] For information about sailing rentals contact The Moorings (Tel. 367-4000; fax 367-4004; website <http://www.moorings. com>). [SEP] Smaller boats for local jaunts can be rented at Sea Horse Boat Rentals, Marsh Harbour, Abacos (Tel. [SEP] 367-2513; fax 367-2516; website <http://www.sea-horse.com>.

Nearby is Ardastra Gardens, Zoo, and Conservation Centre, a landscaped park famed for its pink flamin	go	s, which are paraded three times a day into a small enclosure to offer visitors a closer look. [SEP] These birds, once common in certain Bahamian islands, are now disappearing, though the reasons for the decline are disputed. [SEP] Another endangered species, the Bahamian Parrot, is under threat from loss of habitat. [SEP] The Gardens is one of only a small number of centers that has developed a breeding program for this vocal and gregarious bird in the hope of replenishing colonies in the wild. [SEP] There are many more species of Caribbean mammals, reptiles, birds, and fish to find as you explore the 51⁄2 acres of tropical parkland.

The island itself also has peculiarities that separate it from other Bahamian Islands. [SEP] It is the most undulating of the islands; one could even call it hilly, with the highest point of land in the Commonwealth, Mount Alvernia, rising to the heady heights of 216 ft (66m) above sea level. [SEP] Many visitors come to this island, named after an English sea captain called Catt, for its beautiful quiet beaches. [SEP] Fernandez Bay, with its arc of fine sand on the protected western side of the island, is said to be the finest in the Bahamas, and the nearby beach at Old Bight is not far behind in terms of beauty. [SEP] Though you can’t	go	wrong anywhere on the western coast. [SEP] Mount Alvernia, in the center of the island, is not far from the airfield at New Bight. [SEP] This settlement originally served as a hermitage for Father Jerome, an Anglican missionary who had converted to Catholicism and become an influential churchman on the Out Islands, responsible for the erection of a number of Catholic Churches. [SEP] Father Jerome built a small Hermitage on the heights of Mount Alvernia that you’ll see as you reach the summit (a 15-minute walk from a rudimentary car park); the missionary was buried in a small hilltop cave here upon his death in 1956 at the age of 80.

[SEP] Children will, of course, revel in the hotel pools and the beaches, the slides at the Waterbom park in Tuban, and when the conditions are right, they can learn to snorkel, sail, and windsurf — but think about their safety.

The silhouette of Gunung Rinjani, 3,726 m (12,200 ft) tall, can be seen from every part of the island, sometimes as a single peak, other times like a line of broken teeth. [SEP] An active volcano (although there has been no major eruption for a century), the mountain is sacred to both Sasaks and Balinese, who make pilgrimages to its crater lake and hot springs. [SEP] Recently it has begun to attract foreigners, too, and two villages in the foothills to the south of Bayan are the most popular starting points. [SEP] Trekking is only safe in the dry season, between June and September. [SEP] A rough and narrow road from the middle of Bayan ascends rapidly to Batu Koq, and then continues to nearby Senaru, where it ends. [SEP] Those wanting to	go	farther have to walk. [SEP] The original tiny village has traditional Sasak houses on stilts, surrounded by a wooden fence. [SEP] Some of the locals have opened homestays along the road, a few with a warung attached. [SEP] Guides and porters can be hired by the day, and you can buy basic food and rent camping gear, including tents. [SEP] Take water-purifying tablets, warm clothes, and arrange for a small camping stove. [SEP] The main objective of most trekkers is the awesome crater with its big C-shaped lake. [SEP] It’s a hard day’s walk from Senaru before you reach the rim. [SEP] The crater itself is 600 m (2,000 ft) deep, and the steep, quite slippery scramble down to the lake takes several hours more.

Two of the greatest Qing emperors, Kangxi and his grandson Qianlong, maintained the Ming Tombs and saw to the building of the Summer Palace, while the last great imperial ruler of China, the Empress Dowager Cixi, kept the Summer Palace and the Forbidden City in splendid condition into the early 20th century. [SEP] These and most other historic sites at Beijing were either preserved or created by the Qing rulers, including their own imperial tombs, which rival those of the Ming. [SEP] The Qing Dynasty is also celebrated for its elaboration of the artistic traditions it inherited from the Ming Dynasty. [SEP] What we know as Peking-style opera and still see performed today in the capital became formalized under the Qing, although its roots (and costumes)	go	back to Ming and earlier eras. [SEP] The Ming were also noted for their superb ink paintings, cloisonné enamel work, furniture design, and lacquerware — but above all for their porcelains of the “five-colors” and “blue-and-white” schools. [SEP] At the end of the Ming, these porcelains with landscape and garden designs became all the rage in Europe, where imitation “Chinese” pottery began to be produced. [SEP] The Qing continued these artistic traditions, adding increasingly rich and dense ornamentation and applying new colors, many of them clashing or gaudy. [SEP] This absorption in overly elaborate artwork, combined with heavy demands for imperial luxuries, finally coincided with a decline in the dynasty itself.

In spite of it attracting occasional protest marches from those who support the political Far Right, this formidable symbol of the united city generally appears at last to be realizing the vision of Johann Gottfried Schadow, the sculptor who crowned the Brandenburg Gate with the Quadriga, a copper statue of Winged Victory in her four-horse chariot. [SEP] Schadow had wanted the gate to be known as the Friedenstor (Gate of Peace), in keeping with the relief of the Procession of Peace that he himself had sculpted beneath Victory’s simple chariot. [SEP] The gate itself, designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, was built between 1789 and 1791. [SEP] With two rows of six Doric columns forming the gateway proper, it was inspired by the Propylaeum gatehouse leading to the Parthenon in Athens. [SEP] (To	go	all the way, Hitler had even planned to hoist the gate onto an artificial hill, in an attempt to create a mini-Acropolis.) [SEP] Forming part of the city wall, the gate was intended by the more pragmatic Prussians not so much as a triumphal arch as an imposing tollgate for collecting duties. [SEP] The gate was left isolated in no-man’s land when the Wall went up, and subsequently became the scene of quite ecstatic celebrations when it came down, though now you would scarcely believe it as Berliners cross nonchalantly from east to west through Brandenburg’s mighty central arch.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] The hole is in fact a collapsed cave, producing a natural seawater aquarium that has become home to a number of voracious fish, sharks, and turtles waiting at the surface to be fed. [SEP] The fish (usually large tarpon) seem to enjoy the regular food service offered by visitors. [SEP] Incidentally, the name “Devil’s Hole” derives from the sound of the seawater entering and leaving the hole, rather than from the fearsome reputation of some of its inhabitants. [SEP] From Devil’s Hole Aquarium it is possible to take the road left to the village of Flatts and the North Shore Road. [SEP] However, you can	go	back to South Road in the direction of Tucker’s Town and two important	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Course and Castle Harbour Golf Course straddle the roads here, their verdant greens and fairways tumbling across the undulating land, separated by small casuarina copses. [SEP] (Be mindful of the state of play as you pass across the fairways here: there is a danger from flying or wayward balls!) [SEP] The Mid Ocean Club is still a private members’ club with a long pedigree. [SEP] It has played host to many important political summits since the end of World War II, including the “Big Three” Conference in 1953 attended by Winston Churchill, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Joseph Laniel, the French prime minister. [SEP] South Road comes to an abrupt end at Tucker’s Town Bay, a small jetty and inlet with yachts bobbing gently in the water. [SEP] To get across Castle Harbour to St. George’s, you must	go	north here, taking Paynter’s Road to Harrington Sound. [SEP] Then drive up along Harrington Sound Road to reach the Causeway to St. George’s. [SEP] On your way up Harrington Sound Road, you will come to Lemington Caves, a series of caves smaller than Crystal Caves but equally spectacular. [SEP] Watch also for Walsingham Lane and a sign to Tom Moore’s Tavern, named after the Irish poet who spent some time on Bermuda. [SEP] The tavern (which is in fact a restaurant with French and local cuisine) is open only in the evening. [SEP] In the daytime you can visit Idwal Hughes Nature Reserve, also along Walsingham Lane — a pristine area of natural habitat. [SEP] Collapsed limestone caves and tidal seawater mangrove swamps provide a perfect home for herons, tropical frogs, and many species of fish.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Charlestown Across the river, the Charlestown Navy Yard has played a major role in Boston’s history for nearly two hundred years. [SEP] Today it’s home to the indomitable “Old Ironsides,” or the U.S.S. Constitution, a war ship that was built in 1797 in the North End for $302,718. [SEP] During her naval career, she won 42 battles, captured 20 vessels, and was undefeated. [SEP] Her most notable triumphs occurred during the War of 1812 when she vanquished the British ships Guerriere, Java, Cyane, and Levant. [SEP] A British sailor gave her the name “Old Ironsides,” as cannon balls skimmed off her copper sheathed gunwales and he marveled at her apparent indestructibility. [SEP] Today you can	go	aboard to see the decks. [SEP] Every July 4th she fires a salute and is taken out on a short cruise. [SEP] You can also visit the World War II destroyer U.S.S. Cassin Young and take guided tours of the Naval Yard conducted by the park rangers. [SEP] At the adjacent Constitution Museum you can computer skipper the Constitution through some of her famous battles and trace the route she took on her round the world trade mission in 1844. [SEP] Exhibits also show how horrendous were the living conditions endured by her crew of 450. [SEP] Nearby, the 220-ft- (67- m-) tall tapering granite obelisk, the Bunker Hill Monument commemorates the first battle of the Revolution, on 17 June, 1775 — a hollow victory for the British who suffered more than 1,000 casualties against 400 to 600 for the colonials	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
State Street originally linked the wharves to the Old State House. [SEP] Today it is a commercial street boasting the showy glass tower of the Stock Exchange Building (53 Exchange Place), which features a monumental marble staircase in the foyer.

s reach out into Boston Harbor from Downtown and the North End like the fingers on a hand. [SEP] Once this was the second busiest port in the United States, with clippers jostling for space. [SEP] Today after a long period of decline, the area has revived and the granite warehouses have been renovated into apartments, restaurants, offices, and hotels. [SEP] The British sailed home from Long Wharf. [SEP] Today you can sail to the Harbor Islands, take a cruise around the harbor, or just sit and admire the craft at anchor. [SEP] On Central Wharf, the New England Aquarium is one of the best anywhere. [SEP] Its centerpiece is a giant 200,000-gallon tank containing a 24-ft- (7-m-) deep coral reef filled with sharks, sea turtles, and 600 fish from 100 species. [SEP] Five times a day, scuba divers	go	in to feed the fish, a fascinating spectacle to watch. [SEP] Ramps circle the tank so that you can walk around the whole thing.

[SEP] The grand Italian Renaissance building has several decorative highlights — the bronze doors by Daniel Chester French at the Dartmouth entrance, the double marble staircase graced with murals by Puvis de Chavannes and Edwin Austin Abbey, and on the third floor, by John Singer Sargent. [SEP] The Johnson Building was added in 1972 and now the library holds more than six million books stored on 65 miles of shelves. [SEP] Copley Place, on Huntington Avenue, is a large shopping mall, anchored by two 1,000-room hotels, with a hundred-plus shops. [SEP] A walkway connects it to the graceless 52-story Prudential Center, from which the famous amphibious vehicles leave on Boston Duck Tours. [SEP] After touring the shops,	go	up to the Top of The Hub bar-restaurant and Skywalk (open Monday–Friday, 10am–7pm) great vantage points from which to see the Hancock Tower. [SEP] The Skywalk is quieter and more spacious than the neighboring observatory, though the views are less impressive. [SEP] A little farther along Huntington Avenue, the Christian Science World Headquarters may not sound enticing (and indeed, the austerity of the administration buildings around a vast reflecting pool makes a somber first impression). [SEP] Still, the huge basilica of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, a huge Byzantine-style church enveloping the original Mother Church is an amazing edifice.

The main roads of Budapest, and particularly Pest, are busy with people and trafﬁc, and children have to be closely watched. [SEP] Many other areas in the city and the surrounding region, however, are much more suitable for them. [SEP] The obvious place to	go	is the City Park, where the zoo and Vidám Park are within a few yards of each other, and the circus makes regular appearances. [SEP] The zoo as well as the amusement park are more traditional than modern, but the circus is reputedly one of Europe’s best. [SEP] If the weather is warm, the splendid Széchenyi Baths is the perfect place for cooling off. [SEP] In summer there’s a boating lake in the park and in winter this converts to an ice-skating rink.

Buda Hills The Buda Hills area is a greenbelt that lies due west of Rózsadomb, though it stretches as far north as Obuda and as far south as the start of the M7 highway. [SEP] Choose a clear day, then catch any one of several trams or buses which	go	past the cog-railway terminus (just west of Moszkva tér, opposite the Hotel Budapest). [SEP] There is room on the train for mountain bikes if you are feeling particularly active. [SEP] The train passes smart residential houses on its way to the terminus and park of Sváb-hegy. [SEP] A short walk across the park (just follow the crowds) is the stop for the Children’s Railway (Széchenyi-hegyi Gyermekvasút), thus named because it is operated almost entirely by school-children; only the engine drivers are adults. [SEP] This is an old narrow-gauge line which traverses seemingly unspoiled forests — but for the numerous walking trails — and climbs, slowly, ever-upwards.

[SEP] At the ﬁrst stop, Normafa, you’ll find a ski-run, but unless it’s snowing stay on the train until János-hegy. [SEP] It is a 10–15 minute walk from here to the János-hegy lookout tower, at 529 metres (1,735 feet) the highest point in the city. [SEP] If the horizon is not blurred by mist, there’s a splendid 360-degree view for mile upon mile; you can also eat here. [SEP] On the way to the lookout tower you will have passed a chair-lift that	go	es down to a camping site. [SEP] The views from the chair-lift are also spectacular, and the peace and quiet as you soar up and down the mountainside is quite extraordinary.

hopping in the city. [SEP] Here you will ﬁnd the best fashion, art, cosmetics, books, and jewellery; the biggest and the best branch of Folkart (see page 78); the Pest Színház (theatre) where Franz Liszt made his city debut as a 12-year-old pianist; various airline offices, and several international organizations. [SEP] Váci utca runs into the ever-busy, yet somehow relaxed, Vörösmarty tér. [SEP] This is one of Pest’s favourite gathering places, often lined with craft stalls and resounding to a brass band. [SEP] After a browse through Luxus department store, it’s probably time for coffee and cakes at Gerbeaud, doyen of Budapest’s coffee-house scene since 1884. [SEP] If the sumptuous high-ceilinged interior is a little too formal for your liking, then take a terrace seat and watch the world	go	by. [SEP] Stroll a few yards towards the river and you will come to yet another pleasant and lively square, Vigadó tér, which has the advantage of a riverside location with Castle Hill views. [SEP] Here, too, you will find craft stalls and any number of buskers. [SEP] A vibrant café-restaurant comprises one side of the square, but the dominant building is the splendid Vigadó theatre. [SEP] The interior hall is an acoustically perfect auditorium renovated in 1980 (its predecessors having twice perished in war and revolution), but the façade has been gloriously restored in mid-19th-century Hungarian-Eastern style. [SEP] The list of performers and conductors who have graced the Vigadó theatre is an impressive Who’s Who of the past 150 years of European classical music: Liszt, Brahms, Wagner, M	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
City Park (Városliget) Beyond the pompous formality of Heroes’ Square and away from the noise and trafﬁc of Andrássy út, the City Park is a lovely green space where Budapestis can relax, stroll, have a meal, hire a rowing boat,	go	to the zoo, or visit museums. [SEP] The park, which covers some 101 hectares (250 acres), began to evolve in the early 19th century, though many of the present amenities were added during preparations for the Millennium festivities of 1896. [SEP] Cross the bridge over the boating lake, which doubles as an ice-skating rink in winter.

[SEP] It reproduces in convincing detail part of the exterior of the fairytale Hunyadi castle in Transylvania. [SEP] Inside the castle is the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture, housing a comprehensive collection that illustrates the history of hunting, fishing, and farming.

The rust-red, mid-18th-century Serbian church on the hill is only open for services, but in its grounds is the excellent Collection of Serbian Ecclesiastical Art, displaying precious carvings, icons, and manuscripts. [SEP] The oldest church in the town lies just above here on top of the hill, affording a perfect vantage point from which to peer down into the tiny gardens and courtyards and across the town’s venerable rooftops. [SEP] The Catholic parish church dates mostly from the 13th century, though parts of it	go	back to the 11th century.

[SEP] In the middle-class neighborhoods of Los Angeles county it seems that every other house has its own swimming pool — from the air you see the mass of turquoise blobs as you fly into the airport. [SEP] Surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, sailing, fishing, waterskiing, and windsurfing can all be enjoyed at various points on the coast.

[SEP] The ceremony takes place at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and admission is by invitation only to members of the Motion Pictures Academy, nominees, and their guests.

All of California’s major cities have elegant shopping districts, but the most spectacular is Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. [SEP] But L.A. has other stylish shopping districts, too: Wilshire Boulevard (ironically named after the eccentric socialist Gaylord Wilshire); Century City, near Westwood Village; Montana Avenue in Santa Monica; and Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood are among the most well-known. [SEP] Hollywood, not surprisingly, is the place to	go	if you are interested in movie memorabilia — original posters which are now valued collectors’ items, screenplays, pin-ups, biographies, and film-related books. [SEP] There are also some excellent cinema bookshops along Hollywood Boulevard. [SEP] Flea markets are set up on the waterfront at Venice Beach and on Saturday at Pasadena’s Rose Bowl. [SEP] You should also look out for the garage sales that are regularly advertised in residential areas, where families clear out any unwanted articles — everything from old tennis rackets to kitchen gadgets. [SEP] You can often pick up some truly amazing bargains, as well as pieces of Americana that may mean more to foreigners than they do to their American owners.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
 It took four years and $35 million to build; more than 40 million vehicles now cross over the span every year. [SEP] You can take a bus to the bridge entrance and then walk across — it’s just as exciting an urban adventure as climbing up the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building. [SEP] The bridge trembles underneath your feet, and the lamp-posts rattle as the wind whistles through swooping cables. [SEP] But don’t worry — the 746-ft- (227-m-) high towers are well embedded in earthquake-proof foundations. [SEP] Visible in the distance is the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, known locally as just the Bay Bridge. [SEP] This silver-gray structure swings across to Oakland via two suspension spans, a cantilever span, and a tunnel through Treasure Island. [SEP] It’s the bridge you’ll take to	go	to Berkeley (see page 40) and is one of the routes to the wine country of Napa and Sonoma (see page 41). [SEP] Beneath the south end of the Golden Gate is Fort Point National Historic Site, the site of the brick fort built in 1857 to protect the entrance to the harbor. [SEP] You can now watch surfers brave the waves here. [SEP] The fort lies within the grounds of the 1,480-acre (597-hectare) Presidio, a former army post that was converted to civilian use in 1994.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
West of Mackenzie House, at the corner of Yonge and Dundas streets, is one of Toronto’s shopping “musts,” the Eaton Centre. [SEP] The late-20th-century phenomenon of the giant mall becomes here a spectacular showcase of galleries under an arched glass roof, with fiberglass geese suspended in a refreshing décor of greenery and flowers. [SEP] West of Nathan Phillips Square, beyond tree-lined lawns, is Os	go	ode Hall, a true jewel of Georgian architecture in white limestone and amber brick, and the seat, since 1832, of the Law Society of Upper Canada. [SEP] Notice the beautiful wrought-iron “cow gates” put up at the main entrance to keep the cattle out in those early rural days. [SEP] It may whet your appetite to see a couple of other gracious relics of the Georgian era inside. [SEP] Visit Campbell House (1822) on the northwest corner of Queen and University Streets.

[SEP] There are several vantage points from which to view the Falls. [SEP] Table Rock, named after a ledge that’s long since fallen in the river, is right on the brink of Horseshoe Falls. [SEP] Down below, the Table Rock Scenic Tunnels take you behind the mighty wall of water. [SEP] With the price of the ticket, you borrow some protective clothing, but nothing is totally waterproof against Niagara. [SEP] Don’t let that worry you — seeing Niagara and not getting wet would be silly. [SEP] Just keep a dry change of clothing in the car. [SEP] A boat tour below the falls in one of the three vessels that	go	by the name of Maid of the Mist takes you past and damply close to both falls.

[SEP] Away from the hustle and hype, Queen Victoria Park is a delight for hikers, cyclists, and picnickers — even cross-country skiers in winter, when the falls take on a much more romantic look, all the more so for being relatively deserted. [SEP] In spring, the park gardens put on a magnificent show of daffodils, tulips, magnolias, and roses, and diners in the park restaurant get a great view of the falls’ nighttime illuminations.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] The Bay of Fundy’s 16 m (50 ft) high tides produce remarkable effects in the river estuaries and along the coast. [SEP] Linked to Nova Scotia by the narrow Chignecto Isthmus, New Brunswick became a separate province in 1784 at the demand of 14,000 Loyalist refugees. [SEP] It took its name from the German duchy then ruled by George III of England. [SEP] The Loyalists joined earlier settlers from New England, Pennsylvania, and Yorkshire, and French Acadians who had trickled back after their deportation during the Anglo-French wars.

Safely up on a hill on Military Road, the Catholic Basilica of St. John the Baptist (1850) escaped the numerous fires to dominate the town’s skyline with its granite and limestone towers.

[SEP] The hill was fortified to guard the harbor entrance during the Napoleonic Wars, and you can still see cannon of the Queen’s Battery, installed in 1796. [SEP] The Cabot Tower atop the hill was built in 1897, fourth centenary of Cabot’s landing and diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria. [SEP] Four years later, at 12:30pm, December 12, 1901, in a receiving station improvised near the tower in a hospital (burned down in 1920), Guglielmo Marconi suddenly yelled: “Do you hear that?

[SEP] Try to be there at sunset, too, to see the city light up. [SEP] A favorite with skiers, the mountain also offers a fine view northwest over Capilano Lake and across to Vancouver Island. [SEP] If you feel like a quick whiff of the wilderness on your way back, turn off to walk the swaying suspension bridge 76 m (230 ft) above the fast-flowing waters of Capilano Canyon. [SEP] To get an equally impressive view of the city set against its mountains,	go	downtown to the observation deck (and its restaurant, if you like) on top of the 40-story Harbour Centre (555 West Hastings Street). [SEP] A bonus on clear days is a view south, with the long-range telescope, of Mount Baker across the American border in the state of Washington.

[SEP] At this point it is quite likely that you will be in the clouds; temperatures are very low, and in winter there may well be snow on the ground. [SEP] The landscape becomes very lunar-like; it was around here that some of the filming for Planet of the Apes took place.

[SEP] Less than 20 km (121⁄2 miles) from north to south, this amazing island has been declared a Property of Humanity by UNESCO. [SEP] In fact, a third of the island, 12,450 hectares (30,774 acres) has been designated into seventeen protected areas. [SEP] Such terrain, though, makes for difficulty in getting around, and even the Romans, had they ventured this way, would have found their legendary ability to build straight roads put to an impossible test. [SEP] In fact, almost nowhere on the island will you find a straight stretch of road, everywhere you	go	the roads twist and turn continually, often turning back on themselves in hairpin bends. [SEP] Making driving even more complicated is the fact that the roads, although improving, are often of poor quality, and the directional signs leave much to be desired.

[SEP] The final destination though is a lovely, remote site just before Barlovento where, after a tortuously twisting journey down through banana plantations, you will reach the Piscinas Fajana; literally swimming pools built into the rocks and fed by the ocean waters that often crash into them. [SEP] Showers and toilets are on hand, as is the pleasant La Gaviota (the Seagull), a restaurant/bar, and the views north of the cliffs falling straight into the ocean and being pounded by waves are breathtaking. [SEP] The	go	al in the north for most travelers is the Roque de los Muchachos, the highest point in the island at 2,423 m (7,950 ft) above sea level. [SEP] There are several ways up to it, but always be aware of the weather; what looks fine from sea level takes on a different perspective at nearly 2,438 m (8,000 ft).

The main attraction is the 26-km- (16-mile-) long sandy shores of Jandía that run from the narrowest part of Fuerteventura down to Morro Jable. [SEP] At the northern tip of the Jandía sands are the beautiful beaches of Costa Calma, not blighted as yet by over-development. [SEP] Here, a low cliff backing and a scattering of rocks and coves give the beach far more character than some of the seemingly endless stretches farther south. [SEP] The Playa de Sotavento is world-famous as a windsurfing center, with activity focused on the F2 school at the Sol Elite Gorriones Hotel. [SEP] This has one of the best, and most isolated beach locations in all of the islands. [SEP] Here the beach is very wide and flat, usually empty and, as the tides	go	out, also very wet. [SEP] The dunes behind and a little farther to the south form an idyllic beach backdrop. [SEP] Urbanizaciones spread relentlessly all the way down the coast to Morro Jable, which has some similarities with its northern sister Corralejo; both are ports and resorts, but in most other aspects are quite dissimilar. [SEP] Whereas Corralejo is flat, rather dingy, without many hotels and restaurants of much class, and doesn’t have much of its own beach, Morro Jable, built along the cliffs, is bright and airy, boasts numerous fine hotels and restaurants, and has miles of wonderful beaches. [SEP] It is interesting to note that while Corralejo is a mainly British resort Morro Jable, on the other hand, is frequented predominantly by Germans.

[SEP] It is also possible to dive and swim in cenotes, sinkholes found in the sub-surface limestone layer of the Yucatán peninsula, caused by millions of years of erosion. [SEP] The Maya considered them to be holy places because they were the only source of fresh water other than what fell from the sky; for this reason, Mayan artifacts have been found in many cenotes. [SEP] The holes provide an environment for turtles, eels, and a variety of tropical fish. [SEP] Swimming in the cool, fresh water of the cenotes (a nice change from the salt water of the sea) is great fun. [SEP] Cenote diving is only for the experienced.

[SEP] The addresses of most hotels or restaurants will include their position on Kukulkán Boulevard in kilometers; the farther south, the bigger the number. [SEP] This guide explores the island from north to south, giving the exact location of attractions in kilometers to make it easy for you to find what you need. [SEP] You could rent a vehicle of some sort to travel back and forth to your hotel, but there is a very reliable and inexpensive bus service stopping regularly, and usually directly outside the major hotels, at intervals along the route. [SEP] The buses run from early morning to midnight. [SEP] Crossing from the mainland onto the island — into the area called the Hotel Zone — the la	go	on with its rich mangrove forest is on the right. [SEP] You may see a passing pleasure-boat on the water, or a jet-ski convoy on the lookout for wildlife such as herons, pelicans, deer, wild boar, even the occasional crocodile — though the local creatures tend to only be found in the most remote parts of the mangrove, well away from humans.

The Spanish conducted the first Catholic mass in Mexico here after their arrival in 1518, but they had little interest in the island. [SEP] It remained almost uninhabited through the 18th century. [SEP] But following the War of the Castes in 1847–1848, several rebel families settled here to escape retribution by colonial landowners on the Yucatecan mainland. [SEP] They eked out a simple living for decades until the invention of the scuba tank. [SEP] And the rest, as they say, is history! [SEP] Cozumel has multiple personalities; it caters to divers who	go	to bed early and rise with the sun, yet it also has occasionally raucous nightlife for those who want to stay out and party. [SEP] Those who know the island well refer to this phenomenon as the “wet” side and the “dry” side. [SEP] Day-trippers who arrive on their huge floating cruise ships — or on daily ferries from Playa del Carmen — add an extra dimension; they want to see everything in a few hours, so the slow routine of island life speeds up when they arrive. [SEP] There is only one settlement, the capital, on Cozumel, San Miguel de Cozumel; it’s a bustling town chock-full of souvenir shops, duty-free emporiums, bars, and assorted cafés and restaurants. [SEP] If you arrive on the island by ferry from the mainland, you’ll be dropped off directly opposite the heart of the downtown area, P	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Concerts and Ballet During the Cultural Revolution, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky were banned and many musicians banished to the countryside for “re-education.” [SEP] So if you	go	to a concert today, you’ll sense the drama of recovery from mad xenophobia. [SEP] This needn’t obscure the fact that some professional musicians haven’t yet reached world standards. [SEP] But the enthusiasm of players and audience is exciting in itself. [SEP] Ballet, a vehicle for ideological indoctrination during the 1960s and 1970s, is much less restricted today. [SEP] Folk legends are often a source of inspiration, and classical European works are sometimes performed, with elaborate costumes, sets, and lighting effects.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1

Mostly the city is flat, which is a mercy for the millions who bicycle to work in the world’s most unlikely rush hour, a chaos of buses and trucks and more bikes than you’ve seen in your whole life. [SEP] In 1998, Beijing took the unthinkable step of actually banning bikes from one street, Xisidonglu, where bicycle flow had reached more than 100 per minute. [SEP] In the Middle Ages, the emperors decided to do something about the capital’s unrelieved flatness. [SEP] They ordered hills to be artificially constructed just north of the Forbidden City so they could	go	up and, in total privacy, enjoy a summer breeze and a bird’s-eye view over the curved tile roofs of their imperial compound. [SEP] Try it yourself, perhaps at dawn, when a thin haze drapes itself over the pavilions, redefining yet softening the features of this storybook skyline.

Changsha If you	go	to Changsha by train, you will arrive at the second biggest railway station in China, a distinction quite out of proportion to the amount of rail traffic or the size of the city. [SEP] The explanation is that, until the late 1970s, legions of pilgrims converged on this provincial capital in search of the roots of Chairman Mao Zedong. [SEP] Now that the cult of Mao has faded in glory, the stations and the shrines are uncrowded and Changsha has returned to its age-old role as a rather prosaic regional center of trade and culture. [SEP] However, the surrounding fertile countryside is attractive, the spicy Hunan cuisine is worth trying, the scenic mountain areas of the province are outstanding, and the archaeological displays are stunning.

ms. [SEP] Among the exhibits are bows and arrows and Chinese flintlocks, rare jade and porcelain, and the sedan chairs in which the emperors were transported all the way from Beijing. [SEP] The emperor’s bedroom is located in the Refreshing Mist-Veiled Waters Pavilion. [SEP] The halls and courtyards are eminently regal, yet they also inspire a feeling of relaxation appropriate to the setting. [SEP] The plain wooden corridors connecting the buildings contrast with the illustrated passageways of Beijing’s Summer Palace, which occupies but half the space of the Chengde retreat. [SEP] The landscape beyond the palace compound features many of the romantic elements of Chinese tradition: interconnected lakes and lotus ponds, forests, causeways and arched bridges, ornate pavilions, and towering pa	go	das. [SEP] The Tower of Mist and Rain (Yanyulou), a two-story lakeside pavilion in the southern style, was favored by emperors for its foggy views resembling those of an old Chinese painting. [SEP] Tourists can cross the lakes in hand-poled ferryboats or drift at their own pace in a rowing boat. [SEP] North of the lakes there are hiking trails in the Garden of Ten Thousand Trees (Wanahuyuan), where Emperor Qianlong gave an audience in 1793 to the first British ambassador to set foot in China, Lord Macartney.

Yangzi River Cruise China’s most exciting boat trip is the Yangzi River cruise through the spectacular Three Gorges (Sanxia). [SEP] It takes at least three days to	go	downriver from Chongqing to Wuhan, and as many as five days in the reverse direction, bucking the considerable tide. [SEP] Until relatively recently the trip was considered an extended, risky adventure. [SEP] The most awesome scenery is concentrated between the Sichuan city of Baidi and Nanjin Pass in Hubei Province. [SEP] The sight of the Yangzi water rushing between the sheer walls and evocative rock formations never fails to stir the traveler’s spirit. [SEP] In 1992 the National People’s Congress passed a resolution to launch the massive Three Gorges Hydropower Project, including the construction of a huge dam and a reservoir, slated for completion sometime after the year 2009, which will submerge the most scenic sections of the river.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
The town, capital of the Bai Autonomous Region, has sections of a medieval wall with formal gates on the north and south ends. [SEP] Within the walls are a few intersecting main streets whose tile-roofed shops and houses now serve as souvenir shops, private travel agencies, hostels, and — above all — small, intimate, friendly cafés serving a truly international mix of inexpensive dishes. [SEP] The café life in Dali is one of its chief delights. [SEP] Cafés are perfect spots to wile away the sunny hours over coffee or beer or to meet local Bai people as well as other travelers. [SEP] Perhaps the most famous of the dozens of cafés is Mr. China Son’s Cultural Exchange Café, run by Uncle Li (Heliyi), the first Bai in history to	go	abroad. [SEP] His autobiography, on sale at his café, is an epic soap opera. [SEP] Dali also has sights and attractions well worth attending to when the café and bistro scene begins to pale. [SEP] Erhai Lake is a 30-minute walk from town, and its main village, Caicun, is a maze of unpaved alleys and mud houses. [SEP] Ferries cross the lake to even more remote villages, including the temple dedicated to Guanyin (	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
On the River The transcendent tourist experience of Guilin — and perhaps of all China — is a boat trip on the Li River. [SEP] The karst scenery could hardly be more romantic. [SEP] But life along the river is also fascinating: washerwomen squatting on the shore, water buffalo ambling down for a dip, the improvised ferryboats, and the captive cormorant birds, their necks ringed to prevent them from swallowing all their catch, waiting for orders to	go	fishing from bamboo rafts. [SEP] Large, flat-bottomed tour boats usually leave early in the morning from the quay near the Liberation Bridge in central Guilin. [SEP] (In the dry season, when the river is at its lowest, the first part of the journey must be undertaken by coach.) [SEP] With room for more than 100 passengers each, most of these vessels are quiet and serve a lunch cooked en route.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] The original bronze was found in an ancient Han Dynasty tomb in Gansu Province in 1969. [SEP] You can buy a bronze copy in the museum shop — for a tidy sum.

For centuries Suzhou has been famous for its canals and gardens, its beautiful women, and the musical cadences of the local dialect. [SEP] An old Chinese proverb, referring to the area’s linguistic charms, claims that even an argument in Suzhou sounds sweeter than flattery in Guangzhon. [SEP] Marco Polo found the inhabitants better traders than warriors, and he described the city as large and magnificent. [SEP] So much silk was produced, he reported, that every citizen was clothed in it and the surplus was exported. [SEP] Even today, silk still retains its significance in the local economy. [SEP] Whether you	go	to Suzhou from Shanghai or Nanjing, you will be moved by the wayside scenery, typical of China’s “land of fish and rice.” [SEP] Sampans and scows ply the canals that divide the farmlands, where barefoot peasants in straw coolie hats squelch through the muddy rice fields. [SEP] The Grand Canal is crowded with strings of barges laden with fruit and vegetables, construction materials, or coal. [SEP] Suzhou in fact means “Plentiful Water.” [SEP] The Grand Canal, second only to the Great Wall as a Chinese engineering achievement, was started 2,400 years a	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1

The rivers of the Costa Blanca region may reveal carp and barbel, but don’t expect much excitement. [SEP] The best freshwater fishing hereabouts is the Amadorio Dam, 4 km (21⁄2 miles) from Villajoyosa (see page 34) and, to a lesser extent, Guadalest’s dam. [SEP] They hold barbel, the biggest carp, smallish black bass, and rainbow trout — introduced in 1977 and still protected. [SEP] To catch them you’ll need a licence with a trout supplement. [SEP] The season for non-mountain trout runs from the first Sunday in March to 15 August. [SEP] The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries oversees licences. [SEP] If you	go	sea fishing, you will need local knowledge to hook big grey mullet, sea bream, bass, and maybe even grouper below quiet cliffs, and mackerel two or three miles out.

t less than some mineral waters and will be blended to your taste; containers are extra. [SEP] Sherry (jerez), a wine fortified with brandy, has been made in Spain for hundreds of years. [SEP] By the early 18th century, Spain was already exporting it to France. [SEP] It’s hardly surprising, then, that only Spanish sherry can carry the name unlinked with a country of origin. [SEP] You will find all the world-famous names on the Costa Blanca, all at reasonable prices. [SEP] If you are baffled by the choice, remember the main types and experiment. [SEP] Finos are dry and pale, with a rich bouquet. [SEP] They are usually taken as aperitifs, particularly manzanillas, the driest of all, and amontillados. [SEP] Olorosos (which include the brown and cream varieties) are sweet, heavy, and dark, and	go	well with dessert. [SEP] Somewhere between the two are the amorosos. [SEP] These are medium dry, light amber in colour, and can be ordered for an aperitif or as a dessert wine. [SEP] Most can be bought from the barrel, blended to your own taste. [SEP] Spanish champagne (Cava) is mass-produced and reasonably priced but almost always sweet. [SEP] For a dry drink, look for the description brut.

Remains under and around the palace show Neolithic settlements, though the first palace was built after 2000 b.c. — later than Knossós and Phaistós — and it revealed no Kamáresware pottery from the Pre-Palatial period like that found at the other palaces. [SEP] Its design is also simpler with no large halls or fine wall decorations. [SEP] This first palace was destroyed by the earthquake c1700 b.c. and there are scant remains of it left in the northwest of the site. [SEP] The new palace centered on an open courtyard with a west wing mainly consisting of magazines (storerooms) and cult rooms. [SEP] A loggia fronted the square on this wing. [SEP] In one room of this wing a píthoi was found with a ceremonial dagger inside, alongside this lay a sword decorated with	go	ld and crystal leading scholars to conclude that this was a preparation or contemplation room for the King.

Overlooking the grove’s lily pond is an exact replica of the famous bust of the Dama de Elche (The Lady of Elche). [SEP] The original, dating from 500 b.c. and now housed in Madrid’s Archaeological Museum, remains something of a puzzle almost a hundred years after it came to light. [SEP] If you cover that exotic headdress, you’ll see why attributions are difficult to make: The face could be male or female, Spanish, Greek, or Eastern. [SEP] To visit the place where the bust was discovered,	go	to the nearby hamlet of La Alcudia. [SEP] Be sure to see the exhibits of Iberian and Roman finds displayed in the excellent local museum. [SEP] On the way, you’ll see palms that look rather like giant asparagus tips. [SEP] Encapuchadores bind these male trees in spring to produce the pale, bleached fronds that are used in Palm Sunday celebrations. [SEP] These branches, once suitably blessed, are said to conduct lightning, and you’ll see them attached to houses all over Spain.

[SEP] A ten-minute walk west down Calle Cristo brings you to a dignified 18th-century church, Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje (Christ of Good Travels), perfectly named for out-of-town visitors. [SEP] Behind the church is a great sea of crosses and marble saints in a picturesque cemetery; church officials claim it is wholly unrelated to travels that didn’t	go	so well.

[SEP] Camagüey’s finest feature — and marvelously restored — is Plaza San Juan de Dios, an angular old cobblestoned square surrounded by brightly hued, single-story buildings dating from the 18th century plus a lovely yellow church alongside a restored former hospital.

In 1846, during the course of an unsavory palace intrigue involving an unsolved murder, meddling by the queen, and the massacre of some 100 high-ranking court figures who had been lured to a palace courtyard, the instigator of these events became the power behind the throne. [SEP] He was an ambitious and unscrupulous 29-year-old named Jung Bahadur Rana. [SEP] Before long he had exiled the king, replaced him with the youthful crown prince, and arranged to have himself and his family made hereditary prime ministers. [SEP] The Ranas were the rulers of Nepal for 104 years. [SEP] The Shah kings remained, but had only ceremonial power. [SEP] The Ranas kept the country completely insulated from the outside world; foreigners weren’t allowed in and few Nepalis could	go	out.

You can photograph the head-chopping in the Kot Courtyard off the Durbar Square, where	go	ats and bullocks are sacrificed for army units all morning long, as well as in the shops in the palace wall facing the temples in the square. [SEP] Burly young soldiers are expected to dispatch the animals with a single stroke of the heavy khora sword, as the big drum thumps and martial music is played before the massed flags of Nepali regiments. [SEP] The Kot Courtyard, incidentally, is where the first Rana engineered the massacre of a hundred nobles, clearing the path to power in 1846. [SEP] On the tenth day of Dasain family members exchange visits and feast. [SEP] Visits to work supervisors are also obligatory.

On the tenth day of Dasain family members exchange visits and feast. [SEP] Visits to work supervisors are also obligatory. [SEP] Government functionaries, in their uniform of white leggings and black jacket and cap,	go	to the palace to receive the tika from the king. [SEP] Thousands of ordinary people also line the streets around the palace, waiting hours to receive the king’s blessing. [SEP] There is still a celebratory feeling in the air two weeks later, when Tihar, also called Deepawali, is celebrated.

Although they are so close to Kathmandu as almost to be suburbs, the sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur each have a distinct character and unique attractions. [SEP] For 300 years, until forcibly united in the late 18th century, they were separate kingdoms with related, but not always friendly, Malla rulers. [SEP] Within and beyond the valley are many more sights worth taking in on day trips, including viewpoints on the valley’s rim from where you can see the Himalayas at sunrise and sunset, particularly recommended if you are not planning to	go	trekking. [SEP] For many visitors, trekking is the main purpose of a trip to Nepal. [SEP] The special section on trekking gives hints and tips on what to expect, what to take along, the dangers to avoid, and a brief description of the more popular treks (see page 75).	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
16th century. [SEP] Designed after the temple at Bodh Gaya in India where Buddha reached enlightenment, this soaring spire boasts an image of Buddha on each one of its bricks. [SEP] Extensively damaged during the 1934 earthquake, it was later reconstructed. [SEP] The road from Kathmandu to Patan passes an Ashoka stupa (one of four in Patan) and brings you to Jawalakhel and the Tibetan Cooperative. [SEP] Founded in 1960 with Swiss assistance for Tibetan refugees, this center makes and sells carpets. [SEP] In surrounding buildings the process of carding, washing, spinning, and dyeing the wool, then weaving the carpets, can be followed from start to finish. [SEP] Quality of carpets is judged by the number of knots per square inch: 60, 80, or (superlative) 100. [SEP] Profits of the cooperative	go	to support schools and help handicapped and aged Tibetan refugees. [SEP] At the nearby Patan Industrial Estate, Newari craftsmen can be watched carving windows and door frames for reconstruction projects or boxes for the tourist trade. [SEP] They use the same tools and methods as their ancestors, and demonstrate the same skills. [SEP] So do the bronze-workers, who cast figurines by the ancient “lost wax” method. [SEP] These artisans are not faking antiques; they are continuing traditions.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
 the park boundary and especially at Sauraha near park headquarters, dozens of lodges and inexpensive guest houses cater to budget-minded tourists. [SEP] Elephant rides, jeep tours, and canoe trips can all be arranged at the park entrance, where an interesting interpretive center provides a history of the area and information about its ecology. [SEP] One is reminded that in 1938, during a safari arranged for the British Viceroy of India, hundreds of elephants took part in a hunt that bagged 120 tigers, 38 rhinos, and 27 leopards. [SEP] Today, hundreds of soldiers are stationed in the park to keep out poachers. [SEP] Package tours, with two or three nights in or near the park, are widely offered by travel agencies in Kathmandu. [SEP] You can fly to an airstrip near the park in half an hour,	go	by car or tourist bus in about six hours, or spend a day or two paddling the rapids of the Trisuli River en route. [SEP] Travel by road provides a glimpse of the Terai, an extension of the Ganges Plain. [SEP] This well-watered farming zone stretches the length of the country on its southern border with India. [SEP] It’s only about 40 km (25 miles) wide, but a third of Nepal’s population lives here, producing much of the nation’s food.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
The cinema is a great national passion, with over 300 different films showing in Paris every week. [SEP] For undubbed versions with French subtitles, look out for the letters VO (version originale) in listings or posters. [SEP] Cinemas on the Champs-Elysées, in Montparnasse, St-Germain-des-Prés, Bastille, and the Forum des Halles all show VO movies. [SEP] Keeping up with the latest in discos and clubs can be a full-time job for professional night-owls: there’s no point in turning up before midnight. [SEP] Many are nominally private, which means you only get in if the doormen like the way you look. [SEP] Some expensive, exclusive examples hide out around the Champs-Elysées, such as Régine’s in the rue de Ponthieu. [SEP] Louder, less expensive, younger, and weirder places come and	go	around Bastille and Oberkampf. [SEP] There’s still some life in St-Germain-des-Prés and the Latin Quarter, especially in university term time — making local friends is the best way to find it. [SEP] Pop and rock concerts are held at the spectacular Zénith in the Parc de la Villette (métro: Porte de Pantin), at Parc-des-Princes (métro: Porte de St-Cloud), and also the Palais Omnisport de Bercy (métro: Bercy). [SEP] Ticket offices (billeteries) at FNAC or Virgin Megastore, both on the Champs-Elysées, will show what groups are in town.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
ican and European musicians, while Le Dunois (rue Dunois) is an intimate place, cultivating more avant-garde music. [SEP] The Lionel Hampton club at the Méridien Etoile (Porte Maillot) has a full program of guest performers. [SEP] The old-established Caveau de la Huchette (rue de la Huchette in St-Germain-des-Prés) opens every night at 9:30pm for listening and dancing to a small combo or big band swing or bebop. [SEP] Entrance prices of around 60–120F may include your first drink; extra drinks cost 30–60F. [SEP] In the realm of classical music, Paris has come back into its own, with many fine concerts at Salle Pleyel and Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, opera at the new Opéra-Bastille, and the ballet at the Opéra-Garnier. [SEP] In all cases, some seats are reasonably priced, though they tend to	go	quickly. [SEP] Look out for free concerts in churches. [SEP] Modern dance is enjoying a revival, with a new wave of small, imaginative companies beginning modestly enough at the Café de la Danse (passage Louis-Philippe) and Théâtre Garnier before reaching the heights of the Théâtre de la Bastille.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
off from the city bustle for a stroll through the Jardin des Tuileries, named after a 13th-century tile works and now beautifully re-landscaped as part of a renovation plan for the Musée du Louvre to the east. [SEP] Walk around the chestnut and lime trees, and admire Aristide Maillol’s 18 sensual statues of nymphs and languorous maidens, a few of which are coquettishly half concealed behind a miniature maze. [SEP] The gardens’ 28 hectares (11 acres) extend across the site of the royal Palais des Tuileries, burnt down during the 1871 Commune (see page 21). [SEP] A few fragments of the palace can be seen by the Jeu de Paume exhibition building in the northwest corner. [SEP] Children can enjoy donkey rides, puppet shows in spring and summer, and model boats on the circular ponds. [SEP] Adults	go	for the giant Ferris wheel installed at the holiday season. [SEP] In the corner near the Seine, facing place de la Concorde, the Orangerie is known for its two oval rooms with Monet’s beautiful Nymphéas (Water Lilies) murals, but see, too, the fine collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings upstairs (see page 71).	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
The Sorbonne Named after the 13th-century college established by Robert de Sorbon for poor theological students, the university was later taken in hand by Cardinal Richelieu, who financed its reconstruction (1624–1642). [SEP] Few of the somewhat forbidding buildings are open to the public, but you can	go	inside the 17th-century courtyard with its ornate sundial and see the outside of the Baroque library and domed church. [SEP] Protest against overcrowding, antiquated teaching, bureaucracy, and the very basis of the social system made the Sorbonne a focal point for unrest in 1968, a year of ferment throughout Europe. [SEP] Over on the quiet, tree-shaded place de la Sorbonne, it’s hard to imagine the police invading such a peaceful sanctuary — one that for centuries guaranteed student immunity. [SEP] But invade they did, and revolt exploded onto the streets. [SEP] Students and workers made common cause, and there followed widespread national strikes that threatened the survival of the	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Claude Monet’s glorious floral and water gardens are much more attractive than the rather artificially restored house. [SEP] The painter lived at Giverny from 1883 to 1926 and painted the gardens many times, especially the water lilies. [SEP] Situated 85 km (53 miles) northwest of Paris by the A13, D181, and D5, or by train from Gare St-Lazare to Vernon with a shuttle bus from the station to Giverny. [SEP] The house is open April–October, Tuesday–Sunday 10am–noon, 2–6pm, the gardens all year Tuesday–Sunday 10am–6pm; closed Monday. [SEP] The best time to	go	is in the early morning (to beat the crowds) during the spring (for the most impressive flower displays).

SHOPPING The demise of Communism in 1989 and the move to a free-market economy have had a dramatic impact on Poland as a shopping destination. [SEP] Drab state-owned stores are a thing of the past.

Poland’s development of a market economy has produced a proliferation of stores and boutiques, including many imported from Western Europe and North America. [SEP] You can now buy most Western	go	ods in large and modern department stores, specialty shops, and market stalls.

Other Live Music and Performing Arts. [SEP] Lisbon is home to the greatest number of opera, ballet, and classical concerts (including the Gulbenkian Symphony). [SEP] Lisbon’s cultural scene offers occasional opera, symphony concerts, ballet, and recitals, usually held in winter. [SEP] The city’s opera company is highly regarded by the rest of the world, and the Gulbenkian Foundation (see page 33) maintains its own symphony orchestra and ballet company. [SEP] Porto (selected European City of Culture for 2001) is certainly on the upswing, featuring a wide spate of concerts and theater that will likely improve the city’s offerings on a permanent basis. [SEP] Nightclubs. [SEP] Lisbon and Porto are both packed with dance clubs and bars that	go	late into the night, and popular Algarve resorts such as Albufeira and Praia da Rocha throb to a disco beat. [SEP] Most other towns in Portugal, while offering a reduced roster of low-key bars, tend to be rather quiet at night. [SEP] Gambling. [SEP] Near Lisbon, the Estoril Casino is one of the biggest draws for gamblers. [SEP] Casinos are also found in the Algarve at Monte Gordo, Vilamoura, and Praia da Rocha, as well as at Figuera da Foz, Espinho, and Póvoa de Varzim. [SEP] Popular games are baccarat, craps, roulette, blackjack, and slot machines.

Perched on the edge of the Bairro Alto is one of Lisbon’s most evocative sights, the shell of the 14th-century Igreja do Carmo, which was packed with worshippers on All Saints’ Day, 1755, when the terrible earthquake brought the roof down. [SEP] The church remains deliberately preserved as an atmospheric ruin. [SEP] Nearby, the sumptuous 16th-century Igreja de São Roque features a lavish baroque chapel of São João Baptista (St. John the Baptist) and a small museum of sacred art. [SEP] You can easily walk to the Bairro Alto from the central squares in the Baixa, but it’s also fun to	go	by tram or board the landmark 30-m (98-ft) Elevador de Santa Justa, which you’ll find just off Rossio square. [SEP] The stately elevator, a 1902 Victorian marvel of iron and glass, was built by Raul Mesnier (not Gustave Eiffel, as many continue to believe). [SEP] The longer, slower route back downhill meanders through the elegant shopping area of Chiado, now totally rebuilt after a drastic 1988 fire that swept through the district. [SEP] Some 6 km (4 miles) west of Praça do Comércio along the river lies the riverside district of Belém. [SEP] Many of the great voyages of discovery set out from here in the 15th and 16th centuries. [SEP] The new sea routes produced a	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Plaza del Quinto Centenario (Quincentenary Square). [SEP] The sculpture symbolizes the 500 years of Puerto Rico’s existence. [SEP] On close inspection, Amerindian and Spanish themes can be seen, but some elements are a little obscure. [SEP] Walk on to reach another small square, Plaza San José (San José Square), one of the gems of the city. [SEP] Situated close to El Morro, it was once one of the most important squares in San Juan. [SEP] In the center is a statue of Juan Ponce de León in full regalia that was cast in 1797 from the iron of a British cannon, confiscated after their unsuccessful attack on the city. [SEP] Edged by historic buildings, the square has changed little since the 17th century, except that many of the houses have been converted to restaurants and bars.

y dock, across Calle Marina, you’ll see the rising edifice of the San Juan Post Office, a magnificent building with Art-Deco features. [SEP] In front of the post office is a tiny tourist information office, La Casita, where you can pick up maps and information. [SEP] Continue past the Post Office and the adjoining Plaza de Hostos, which is full of souvenir stalls (and faux designer watches galore). [SEP] To the left is the Arsenal de la Marina, a fine building with strange Moorish details. [SEP] Built in 1800, it houses the Fine Arts and Folk Arts departments of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. [SEP] In front of you is the Paseo de la Princessa, a smart promenade that has emerged from years of neglect to become the place in town to stroll in the evening, or to sit and watch the world	go	by. [SEP] A number of new statues and fountains now grace the Paseo. [SEP] One, named Raices (Roots), depicts members of each of the races that have contributed to the modern Puerto Rican mix, surrounded by playful dolphins. [SEP] La Princessa, home of the offices of the Puerto Rico Tourist Company, sits along the Paseo. [SEP] Originally a prison — this is why it is outside the city walls — it is now a showcase of modern Puerto Rican art.

South of the historic town center, on Avenue of the Americas (a modern two-lane highway) is the Museo de Arte de Ponce (Ponce Art Museum). [SEP] This collection of European and Puerto Rican art, probably the finest in the Caribbean, would be very much at home in any European capital. [SEP] The museum is the brainchild of Luis Ferré, industrialist and onetime	go	vernor of Puerto Rico, who has put great effort into bringing works of art to the town. [SEP] More than 1,600 paintings and sculptures make up the collection, which covers five centuries of western art. [SEP] The Flemish collection features work by Paul Bril (1554–1626) and David Teniers (1610–1690). [SEP] The Spanish collection has a piece by El Greco (1541–1614). [SEP] Nicholas Maes (1632–1693) is represented in the Dutch collection, and British artists include Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), Thomas Gainsborough (1727–1788) and George Romney (1734–1802). [SEP] Pride of place is taken by the painting Flaming June, by Frederick Lord Leighton (1830–1896). [SEP] The gallery offers a guided tour in English every afternoon at 2pm.

 sheltered, it’s a safe place for children to swim and for everyone to snorkel, though it can get very busy. [SEP] In the rolling hillside behind the beach is Mahogany Run Golf Course, so you could have a round in the morning and swim and snorkel in the afternoon. [SEP] On the eastern end of the island, amid a number of large hotel complexes, is Coki Point, a pleasant beach. [SEP] At the end of the point is Coral World, which offers a fascinating look at life under the water. [SEP] The attraction centers around a number of different controlled marine environments, each with its own animals or fish. [SEP] Watch out for the sting-ray, shark, and turtle pools, where regular feeding times are posted; you’ll even get a chance to pet some of the exhibits. [SEP] Pride of place at Coral World must	go	to the genuine coral reef, which has been implanted in the open water offshore. [SEP] An underground viewing area reached via a walkway allows you to observe the daily activity of the reef fish and some of the larger wild creatures who swim in for the free food provided by Coral World staff. [SEP] Coki Beach is popular spot for snorkelers, simply because there is so much sea-life here, thanks to the regular feedings provided by Coral World around their reef. [SEP] Many of the cruise ships bus their passengers in here for snorkeling so it can get busy, but you are almost always guaranteed a	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	1
Eco- and adventure-tourism fans will feel they’ve reached nirvana here. [SEP] With an increasing number of tourists looking for these options, the Mexican Association of Adventure Travel and Eco-tourism (AMTAVE; Tel. [SEP] (5) 663-5381, or www.amtave.com.mx) was formed to offer information about the most qualified guides and authentic service providers in each area of Mexico, and can direct you to qualified members in the area. [SEP] A word for those enamored of hiking: As a rule, in Mexico there are no marked trails or ranger stations such as you commonly find in the US and Europe. [SEP] Therefore, it is better to	go	with a local operator or qualified guide, or contact a company in the US or Europe that can arrange something that fits your ability and sense of adventure. [SEP] The Sierra Madre Mountains adjacent to Puerto Vallarta offer challenging, yet accessible hiking and mountain biking. [SEP] Bike-Mex (Tel.
