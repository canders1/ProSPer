Unfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression. It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website. However, the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons:<n>a) Moore clearly states that "before he came to Flint", Heston gave an interview. In the excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March. If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers, why would he say this, and show the month the interview was published?<n>b) Why should Moore leave the words "Clinton is on the Today Show" visible in the text, which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part?

Finally she came to the Styx itself. Its awful waters were cluttered with the waste of humans – broken pottery, discarded farming tools, ruined jewelry. And there, leaning heavily on his pole, was Charon, the boatman. She hesitantly handed him the coin, and his dark, empty eyes invited her on the barge. When the barge landed on the opposite bank of the terrible Styx, Psyche clutched the cake she would need for the next horror. A few yards in front of her, growling and snarling, Cerberus sat with trails of drool hanging from his teeth. She tossed him the cake, picked up her skirts, and sped past his huge figure. Persephone herself was kind enough, for the wife of the King of the Dead. She thanked Psyche for coming down, filled a box with cosmetics for Aphrodite, and sent Psyche on her way.

The Bonesetter lived not far away from my house, in a once-colorful gypsy caravan where he did his work. As a child, I had been terrified of the caravan, partly because the Bonesetter growled and snapped at the village children, but also because of the blood-curdling screams that came from inside when people were having their broken bones set, so they would heal properly. Breathless, I arrived at the caravan door, and knocked sharply upon it. I knew that the Bonesetter would not answer unless it was an emergency, so I kept knocking until he opened the door and snarled, “What is it you want that you must make such a racket on my door?” “You must come,” I said, gasping. “It’s hurt.” “I don’t treat animals,” he said, starting to close the door.

It came in through my mother's blood; my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories, bylichkas, of ancestors with the "second sight", stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks, and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times. When I asked her if she'd ever seen them – before I was old enough to stop believing, I mean – she would always look sad and tell me, "No, not since the family came to America has anything happened to us.

When she hadn’t come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn’t see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn’t see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin. The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. He didn’t move, just stared and held his drink.<n>The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving. She nodded and he took her arm. I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall, and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong.<n>Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still hadn’t come home. I called Mitch and our other friends, hoping that she’d crashed at one of their houses, but I had no luck.

“Bummer. So, what’s the cat look like?”<n>He turned to me. Nepthys nodded: “It’s okay, you can trust him. That’s why we came here.”<n>It was easier to talk than to question. “I …I noticed him from across the room when I was looking around for Rachel. He was standing right in front of some blue lights, so I couldn’t see him very well, but I noticed the way that the light set off his pale skin. It almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly. He was slim, almost drawn, but he had a kind of … luster to him, I guess.

“Just at this corner,” he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east. East is that way.” He pointed at the wall to our right. “Don’t let the sun fool you. Then I’m going to shed a little blood, but don’t worry, none of yours.” I blinked at him, but he just kept walking until we reached the corner. “Okay, you might feel silly, but just turn three times to your left. Try to keep in time with me.” We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust. The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back. When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner. Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening the door. “Are you coming?”<n>We slipped through the door and came out, not inside the building, but on a busy street in a completely different part of town. The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East. Nepthys took us immediately to the right, where he led us to a cart filled with herbs. Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn’t place. The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar. Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart, and with its long, many-shouldered pole of a torso, it rose over our heads even while seated. Its face was small and wrinkled, with penny-sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose. “Would the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs?” it asked. “There are no finer to spice a meal, nor purer to mix a potion. Please, let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs.”<n>“We’re not here to browse,” Nepthys told him. “We’d like to see a man about some garlic.”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
The latch opened under Nepthys’ left hand with a clack! The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs. At the top was one door. We entered.<n>The room held a bed, a bookcase, and a desk with one chair. Its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls. On the bed was a small, ratty man. I smelled matted hair and cedar chips. He opened one eye when we came in but did not move.<n>“We’re here for information about a vampire,” said Nepthys.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
“Marvelous!” cried the woman. “One half-pint of human blood, willingly given, and his fine head of hair for the stone.”<n>She took us downstairs to a small room behind a red silk draping. There was a wooden chair, where she sat me down and asked me to wait. Soon, she came back with a lidded ceramic bowl, which she put on the table beside me. “Roll up your sleeves,” she told me. She opened the bowl and carefully, gingerly brought out a fat, dripping leech. It must have been larger than my finger. She laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm. The cold thing stretched and cast around with its sucker-mouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow, where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin. I thought that I could feel a slight itching.<n>“They take about a quarter-pint each,” said Madame Entera, drawing out another skinny leech. “They’re quick, too. We’ll be done with them before your hair is finished.” Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
That made me a little sad. They were always my favorite part of the Greek myths I read in elementary school. “Well, what about you? How did you get to America?”<n>“My parents came over from Russia, just like your family. My real name is a little more ethnically appropriate, but we don’t toss those around in this place. They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary. When the Russian government dammed the river, my parents decided that instead of dying with the river, they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected. I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river. Sure, I miss having a place to settle down, but it’s better than waiting to get dammed.” He took another shot of vodka.<n>“Shouldn’t you be going light on the vodka?

Immediately, I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid. “Nathan,” said Nepthys, “I think that you just did something very stupid.”<n>“I agree,” I told him. The stone was as warm as human flesh now, and there was a sort of glow that might have been light or just the stone’s soft heat, I don’t know. Then there was light, a kind of rosy glow, and I felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air. The air around me seemed to still sound, and light came in around the corners of my eyes. “Do you know what this thing does?” I shouted, hardly able to hear myself.<n>Nepthys was saying something that looked like, “I have no idea!” but I couldn’t hear him. The light in the corners of my eyes rushed in, converging on the rosy glow around the stone, and for a moment I was blind. Then I opened my eyes again and saw a girl lying in the street. There was no sign of the stone.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
“Not if you named it already, you ninny, and I’m sure that you have! Fools! Get out of my sight now – unless you know how to put it back? …I thought as much. Now leave, before I call the rats on you.”<n>We left. Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck. “You idiot,” he hissed, “do you know how much you’ve set us back? I should say, set yourself back, since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for.” I thought about Rachel; in the excitement, I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts. “You’re just lucky that Dvorov isn’t my only contact. Come on, we’re heading out.” He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs. Walking outside, I was shocked to see that it was already dark. “Night comes quickly here,” said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me. “Didn’t I warn you?”<n>“Okay,” he said as we hit the street, “we’re going to see another friend of mine. First, though, we are getting you a hat. You look ridiculous with a shaved head.” At a nearby stand, he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston. It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front. Amy liked it, I think. She still hadn’t spoken since I named her, so I wasn’t sure.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
“Okay,” he said as we hit the street, “we’re going to see another friend of mine. First, though, we are getting you a hat.

It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front. Amy liked it, I think. She still hadn’t spoken since I named her, so I wasn’t sure.<n>He took us to a squat, long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal. The black door opened as we came up to it, and a pale man opened the door. He was naked, but there was nothing to hide: his body was hairless and completely smooth. I only say “he” because he didn’t have a hint of femininity. His eyes were white. From behind him, I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure’s “A Forest”.<n>“I’m here to see Isis. Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her.”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
Something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd, which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before. Then I saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking.<n>I tried to slip along the edge of the crowd. Things with scales and claws kept flailing against me, pressing me into the wall, but I took a breath and kept moving. My nose filled with a reek of thick sweat. The music began to build, and a strobe came on. Somewhere toward the center of the dance floor, I heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing – for a second, I was back with my family in Russia, hiding from the cold. Then I felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that Amy was following me. I gathered her under my arm. Dvorov was somewhere behind me, too, negotiating delicately through his patrons.<n>Just in front of me, a massive thing slammed into the wall, sending up a cloud of granite dust. It slumped to the floor and I realized that it was a werewolf. Its haunches twitched in time to the music. As it started to rise, a man with thick, scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him. I thought that my odds were better on the dance floor.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us. He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall, and we chased up after him, heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held. Luckily, the vampire turned off after three stories. He ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors, but Nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me. I called out to Amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us. Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment. Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room, then made a turn out of sight.<n>When I came to the door at the end of the room, it looked like it had been torn off its hinges. I didn’t imagine that Nepthys had done it, and it wasn’t without alarm that I ran after him.<n>A black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral. The vault rose into obscurity above me, and a massive rose window stood ahead of me. The panes looked dyed black, and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter. Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber, and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere. I couldn’t tell how many people were running, much less where they were. On the steps in front of the altar, I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and two other women. Then I heard Nepthys shout, “Nathan! Behind you!” I whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head, leaping like a panther. He smashed into the pews behind me and I heard him leap across the rest of the row. There was Nepthys, on the other side of the pews, holding the wooden box in his hand. He tossed it to me, and I just barely had it open before I saw the vampire again, turning to face me.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
I was content to let myself drift away, and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral’s hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek. A girl’s voice, soft and almost recognizable, spoke, “Nathan.” I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected. Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me the hammer and stake.<n>I stood and turned toward the altar. The vampire was walking just steps ahead of me. I stepped up behind him and raised my hands, which almost seemed to be glowing. Then the stake came down into his back and one, two, three strikes with the hammer drove it in. The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth.<n>Behind me, Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys, whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug. I pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
The Black Willow<n>Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close. Opening a side drawer, he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot. After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner. His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow. The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards.<n>Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right. The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin. Allan reviewed the troops, all prepared to disembark, their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to-be, thus upsetting the apple cart of his life's plan, clarified – of course – by his very time away from her he loved best.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_The_Black_Willow.txt
"Before?"<n>"Before that blasted impulse came over me and I started writing like Edgar Poe – though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others, thank Heaven."<n>Arthur's face assumed a long-suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation. "I'm not familiar with Mr. Poe's works, but I assume you're referring to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic."<n>	#fiction#	fiction_The_Black_Willow.txt
They parted and Allan made his way pensively from Arthur's gate. He walked the wheel-ruts, hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust. Some quarter-mile from Arthur's gate, he halted, confronted by a halloo. "Nathan?" he called out to the empty road.<n>The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree. "I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today," said Nathan, "so I thought I'd wait here for you." Nathan's lanky frame, dressed in a loose, tan jacket, fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton. His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface, infusing his body with a rakish energy. "So, Allan," said Nathan, unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside, "how goes life for the quintessential American author?"<n>"I wouldn't know," replied Allan dryly, before continuing in another tone entirely. "I destroyed another story last night, Nathan."<n>	#fiction#	fiction_The_Black_Willow.txt
Allan crouched over his desk once more, pen in hand and mind blank. He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago. He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers.<n>His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture. He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward.<n>Arthur looked up from the results of a night’s frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_The_Black_Willow.txt

In the context of this ‘weak’ environment, clear social behaviour emerges as structure gets built at the micro-level. People seek to form relationships and routines in order to learn and thrive in their surroundings. In the Valley, information is the life-blood of the industry and continuous learning through relationships is the key to a successful career. People build their own competence by active membership in the larger learning community. Learning takes place in the pub or club. In the Valley’s early days, it used to take place in the infamous Wagon Wheel Bar and the Homebrew Computer Club. Now it takes place in one of many watering holes or hobby groups where the Valley’s high-technology workers regularly meet for lunch or after work. In these meeting places, people gather to see old friends, gossip, and make new acquaintances. In the workers’ adopted social settings, the transition from friendly chatter to serious business occurs naturally.<n>In the Silicon Valley, collective actions unfold through a combination of mutual interests, intellectual curiosity, and problem solving geared towards developing new markets, technologies, products, or applications for computers. Workers have a systemic commitment to technical excellence in their field. As one engineer explained, the process is quite simple: ‘people rub shoulders and share ideas’ (Saxenian, p. 27). The knowledge of these informal groups is so powerful that many ‘local entrepreneurs came to see social relationships and even gossip as crucial aspects of their business’ (Saxenian, p. 26) As one local manager claimed: ‘‘‘Over a lunch conversation or a beer, you’ll learn that company A or company B has a technology you want . . . If it fits your needs, you’ll build it into your next product’’’ (Saxenian, p. 31). In this manner, micro-level conversations influence the creation of new technologies, products, and applications.<n>It is through such social interaction and collective action that we begin to understand how patterns and order emerge in the Valley. In the absence of hierarchy and centralised planning, employees in the Valley rely on their skills, rather than on formal position, to provide a reference point for their careers. Such self-generated guides are reinforced by professional social networks, which provide a tacit road map about who knows who and who does what in the industry. These networks serve as efficient job search networks and makeshift recruitment centres. As one engineer reported: ‘‘‘You don’t just hire people out of the blue. In general, it’s people you know, or you know someone who knows them’’’ (Saxenian, p. 27). Social networks impose structure on larger and looser situations. It is the region and its relationships, rather than the firm, that define opportunities for individual and collective advances in Silicon Valley (Saxenian, 1996).<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_CUP2.txt
Allan Greenberg is a confirmed Classicist. He does not consider this an anomaly. “To be truly modern,” he writes, “means finding the dynamic balance between eternal human values and the specific demands of the present. Classical architecture provides the means to achieve this balance because it is the most comprehensive architectural language that human beings have yet developed.”11 Although Greenberg looks to the past, his is not the attitude of an archeologist. Like Carrère & Hastings, and generations of architects before them, Greenberg approaches Classicism as a tradition to be studied, absorbed—then extended.<n>Early in his career, after emigrating to the United States from South Africa, Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses, which led to an unusual commission: the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse. He gave the commercial building in Manchester, Connecticut, a new façade dominated by a large arch, over-scaled voussoirs, and a pediment. Inside, the barrel-vaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order. Greenberg had graduated from Yale in 1965, and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism. However, unlike Venturi and Moore, Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building; he was returning to Classical roots. From this modest beginning, over the next two decades, came a variety of commissions: a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building, several college and university buildings, and a Roman Catholic church. His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens, Georgia, a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills. Greenberg is also known for large country houses, both in the United States and in Europe. Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope, he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential work—using Georgian and American Colonial styles. One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon, another by Palladio’s unfinished Villa Thiene. Several are picturesque rambling affairs whose relaxed informality recalls the best work of McKim, Mead & White.<n>One of my favorite Greenberg houses is a cottage set among windblown dunes on the eastern seaboard. Completed in 1992, the low-lying building is shingled, but it is not exactly Shingle Style. Recent Shingle Style buildings are often broken down into many small parts, giving them a fussy and nervous appearance. Such seaside cottages look as if a good wind could blow them away. Greenberg’s aim here is to make a heavyweight building of great solidity that is rooted firmly in the dune scrub. The one-story Atlantic façade is almost perfectly symmetrical: a large arched window flanked by two semi-circular bays, rotund sentinels standing against the ocean winds. The two-story landward side is more informal, ringed by a sheltered porch. Massivity informs the details: sturdy Tuscan columns, a heavy cornice at the eaves of the large roof, rugged window frames. The sense of robustness is accentuated by occasional delicacy: the arched window incorporates scrolled brackets that support an elegant reverse ogee molding at the eaves. Inside, the fireplace has a brick hearth, a slate lintel, and a wood surround, whose almost modern simplicity is softened by a cavetto molding beneath the mantelpiece. The ceiling is supported by exposed trusses of rough, reused timbers. Although most people would describe this house as “traditional,” this is not an exercise in a particular historical style. There is a nod here to the British Arts and Crafts architect  C. F. A. Voysey, and it is obvious that Greenberg has looked at Lutyens’ country houses. But this is a modern house, although designed by an architect with a Classical sensibility. It admirably fulfills Palladio’s call for a correspondence of the whole with the parts and the parts with the whole.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_rybczynski-ch3.txt
No pair of architects could be more dissimilar than this distinctly odd couple, the proper High Society favorite of the Gilded Age and the untidy bohemian from Santa Monica. Yet they bear comparison. They were both late bloomers. Gehry was 48 when he gained national recognition. Until then, he had been running his own office in Los Angeles for almost twenty years, building shopping centers, suburban offices, department stores, and apartments in competent but unremarkable renditions of L.A. modern. The project that brought him to national attention was his own remodeled house: a nondescript bungalow encased in an unsettling Cubist composition of unpainted plywood, corrugated metal, and chain-link fencing. The odd shapes and unorthodox materials marked Gehry as a maverick. That was in 1978. Unexpectedly, he attracted a broad range of commissions, not only residential clients, but also museums, public institutions, universities, corporations, and developers, and not only in the United States but around the world.<n>Hunt was 43 when he came into his own. He had established an architectural practice in New York in 1855, almost immediately on his return from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He was moderately successful, achieving local renown for the Tribune Building, an early New York skyscraper. Despite his Parisian background, Hunt worked in the prevalent Ruskinian Gothic style. Of his Presbyterian Hospital in downtown Manhattan, the architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler wrote: “The building is of Gothic design with very red brick, and very irregular stone dressings, which, it must be confessed regretfully, are not pleasing to the eye.”3 For his next project, the Lenox Library, Hunt tried something different. He borrowed from the French Neo-Grec style, popularized by Labrouste in the Bibliothèque Sainte Geneviève, adding Renaissance details and his own characteristically vigorous surface modeling. The result was a startling departure from convention, a monochrome limestone block of imposing dignity. The Lenox Library (which stood on Fifth Avenue on the site of the present-day Frick Collection) marked a shift in architectural taste, away from Ruskin to a grand and frankly aesthetic Classicism. The 1880s was a decade of great prosperity, and newly wealthy New Yorkers eagerly sought out Hunt’s architectural blend of good taste and ostentatious display. He obliged them in a string of high-profile commissions: magnificent mansions along Fifth Avenue, country houses on Long Island, and palatial “cottages” in Newport, Rhode Island. Hunt died in 1895, but in the last seven years of his life, he completed more than fifty projects.<n>Biltmore House in Asheville, North Carolina, is a good example of his stylistic prowess. Hunt modeled the design of this 250-room residence on the Château de Blois, whose style is not the severe Classicism of the Italian Renaissance favored by architects such as Charles McKim, but the more ornate and picturesque French Renaissance. To a modern visitor, the spires, turrets, and steep slate roofs of Biltmore recall Disneyland’s Sleeping Beauty Castle, which is not surprising since Disney also used a Loire Valley chateau—the Château d’Ussé—as his model. But the comparison does Hunt an injustice, for his design is neither prettified nor quaint. His client, George W. Vanderbilt, was a young bachelor (he married soon after the house was finished), and for him Hunt created an architecture that is robust, masculine, and immensely self-assured, not in the least like a fairytale.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_rybczynski-ch3.txt
