eir primary reason for not doing so was to save money, not to piss off the victims of Colubmine. [SEP] That does not change the fact that they did just that. [SEP] Moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff. [SEP] This is what good documentary filmmaking is about. [SEP] And here the critics again ignore important evidence: When Heston mentions the mayor of Denver, the crowd boos loudly. [SEP] Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayor's letter (only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request -- not mentioning at all the reasons you have given!). This booing by the crowd, not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article, shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by	coming	to Littleton after children were being killed there -- and they effectively said "Fuck you". [SEP] To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moore's critics. [SEP] 4) The Kayla Rolland case. [SEP] Again, critics like yourself charge Moore with deception. [SEP] The rally took place on October 17, the shooting on February 29. [SEP] Again, standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion: "Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas. It is brilliantly, if unethically, done." [SEP] As noted above, the "from my cold dead hands" part is simply Moore's way to introduce Heston. [SEP] Did anyone but Moore's critics view it as anything else? [SEP] He certainly does not "attribute it to a speec	#essays#	essays_A_defense_of_Michael_Moore.txt	come	written	masc_written	2

[SEP] Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails: it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers, and localize the source of food-odors and midden-odors. [SEP] Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on “antennae” stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past (Webb, 1998), regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones. [SEP] As a partial control for the problem of imprecise sensing, a function will perform an analysis of the array information	coming	on from Antie’s four sensors on each stalk. [SEP] The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a “left_IP” or “right_IP.” [SEP] Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg’s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book “Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology,” as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell, et al (2003) to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models. [SEP] Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces, I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine.

[SEP] And there, leaning heavily on his pole, was Charon, the boatman. [SEP] She hesitantly handed him the coin, and his dark, empty eyes invited her on the barge. [SEP] When the barge landed on the opposite bank of the terrible Styx, Psyche clutched the cake she would need for the next horror. [SEP] A few yards in front of her, growling and snarling, Cerberus sat with trails of drool hanging from his teeth. [SEP] She tossed him the cake, picked up her skirts, and sped past his huge figure.

brasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3 of the accident report form. [SEP] Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley. [SEP] Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience. [SEP] At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel. [SEP] Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. [SEP] I refer you again to my weight. [SEP] As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side of the building. [SEP] In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel	coming	up. [SEP] This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and lower body. [SEP] Here my luck began to change slightly.
