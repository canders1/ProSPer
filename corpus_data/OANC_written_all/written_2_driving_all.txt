Our less pessimistic view of the future of these industries should not be misinterpreted. The textile sector appears more promising because it has become more directly connected to retailers and industrial users. Yet survival in both sectors belongs only to the fittest adopters of the new order of retailing and the channel. Employment levels are not projected to turn around. Instead, employment will gradually decline in both industries, while output and productivity increase—the best that any industrial sector can expect over time in the modern economy. The new order in apparel places more of a premium on scale and size, along with investments in the requisite technologies. The traditional contractor shop and small enterprise will have a smaller and even less secure role unless linked to sophisticated intermediary agents in the channel.<n>In short, the paths these industries follow will be determined by their interconnection with one another. Providing a stitch—or a package of pasta, a home computer, an automobile—in time requires a growing degree of integration among business enterprises within and across industries. Whether it is Federated Department Stores’ or Home Depot’s use of point-of-sales information for inventory control; Levi Strauss’s or Black and Decker’s efforts at customizing products to suit very specific consumer groups; or VF’s or Dell Computer’s innovations to provide product diversity more efficiently, channel integration is driving the current industrial transformation—and will continue to do so in the period ahead.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch15.txt
A retail-apparel-textile channel typically includes the companies that manufacture synthetic fibers; produce, gather, and refine natural fibers; spin fiber into yarn; weave or knit yarn into fabric; manufacture buttons, zippers, and other garment components; and cut and sew fabric into garments. It also includes the retailers who sell garments to end consumers. The retail link often involves services or instructions to suppliers about fabric and garment design, packaging, distribution, order fulfillment, and transportation. And it is in some of these areas, particularly distribution and order fulfillment, that channel dynamics have undergone substantial change during the last decade.<n>Supply channels are not new, of course; for centuries, fabric-makers have sold their wares to those who cut and sew garments. But, until recently, most channels in the textile and apparel industries have been characterized by arm’s-length relationships among relatively autonomous firms. It is only since the mid-1980s that a number of market and technological changes have encouraged companies to enhance the links among different stages of production and distribution. Indeed, retailers like Wal-Mart Stores, Kmart Corporation, and Dillard’s Inc. have been the driving forces behind changes in manufacturing and logistics systems in a way that was unheard of in Bond Stores’ time. For instance, entrepreneur Sam Walton built a retail juggernaut that began with thirty-nine Wal-Mart stores in 1971 and grew to almost three thousand by 1996. He did so by insisting that suppliers implement information technologies for exchanging sales data, adopt standards for product labeling, and use modern methods of material handling that assured customers a variety of products at low prices.<n>We contend that this revolution in retailing practices will determine future competitive outcomes in retail-apparel-textile channels. These new practices—which we call lean retailing—have compelled apparel producers to reorganize the manner in which they relate to retail customers, undertake distribution, forecast and plan production, and manage their supplier relations. Lean retailing has also changed the way the textile industry relates to both apparel producers and retailers. Most important, because the apparel industry has been one of the first to face the full brunt of the retail revolution, its story illuminates pervasive changes under way in the entire economy.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt
So what has changed the prognosis for American apparel and textiles and provided new opportunities for these industries? The answer is not to be found simply in the clout of a few retailers or the use of bar codes or EDI. To understand why the apparel industry is a prototype for others, we need to look at the underlying dynamics of demand and its impact on manufacturing practice. Consider once again the contemporary customer’s appetite for variety. Increased rates of product introduction, product proliferation, and shortened product cycles mean that companies have to respond much faster to rapidly changing markets.<n>For our purposes, we can represent growing product diversity in the form of a “fashion triangle” (Figure 1.1). Apparel items at the very top of this triangle include dresses from Paris, Milan, and New York runways, which represent a very small share of apparel sold. The majority of fashion products also have a short selling life—usually one season—but are produced for a broader market. At the triangle’s bottom are basic products that remain in a retailer’s or manufacturer’s collection for several years, such as men’s white dress shirts or underwear. Basics -historically constituted the majority of apparel products sold. In the middle of the triangle are fashion-basic products, typically variants on a basic item but containing some fashion element (such as stonewashed jeans or khaki pants with pleats or trim). This expanding center of the fashion triangle indicates where the industry is headed. Because a growing percentage of basic apparel items have some fashion content, fashion-basic products are driving product proliferation.<n>Product proliferation and shorter product cycles, reflected in ever-changing styles and product differentiation, contribute to general demand uncertainty for both retailers and manufacturers, thereby making demand forecasting and production planning harder every day. In a world where manufacturers must supply an increasing number of products with fashion elements, speed and flexibility are crucial capabilities for firms wrestling with product proliferation, whether they are retailers trying to offer a wide range of choices to consumers or manufacturers responding to retail demands for shipments.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt
Textile firms, however, have been players in multiple supply channels. There are three major categories of sales outlets for these manufacturers: (1) woven goods and some knit goods destined for clothing, in which materials are sold to apparel-makers for fabrication and assembly; (2) home furnishings—such as sheets, bedspreads, towels, and some knit goods—in which the textile firm sells directly to retailers; (3) industrial products, from automobile seat covers and rugs to commercial fishing nets, in which a textile firm sells materials to a car company or other nonapparel manufacturer. Thus, there are at least three kinds of relations among the industries, and multiple textile channels are on the rise. Although apparel uses dominated textile consumption in the past, by the early 1980s apparel’s share of fiber consumption was only 37 percent; home furnishings was about 38 percent; and industrial textile products consumed over 20 percent.<n>Textile companies like Springs have taken advantage of these new outlets—for example, producing Disney-character sheets for retail—but a new dynamic is also developing with apparel-makers, who want shorter runs of materials much more quickly from their textile suppliers. Historically, the textile-apparel relationship involved long lead times or advance commitments to secure the necessary cloth in the right style, texture, and patterns. This occurred not only because of the greater concentration of businesses in the textile industry, but because textile companies generally plan to run their expensive capital equipment at full capacity around the clock. Our research indicates that the relationships between firms in the textile and apparel industries remain underdeveloped, with new competitive forces driving both sides to change.<n>Even if integration efforts in the past have been uncommon, information flows, transport, and inventory have always been decisive factors in shaping the relations among retail, apparel, and textile firms. As Alfred Chandler and other business historians have made clear, successive changes in information exchange and transport over the last century have reshaped relations among industries, as well as the internal organization of these enterprises. Chandler notes,<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
Significantly, it was in several of these [labor-intensive] more fragmented industries—textiles, apparel, furniture, and some food processing—that the mass retailer (the department stores, mail-order houses and chain stores) began to coordinate the flow of goods from manufacturer to consumer. In those industries where substantial economies of scale and scope did not exist in production, high-volume flows through the processes of production and distribution came to be guided—and the resulting cost reductions achieved—by the buying departments of mass retailers, retailers who handled a variety of related products through their facilities.43<n>And so we arrive at the new information technologies of the 1980s. These have begun to create integrated channels among enterprises in the three industries, facilitating even more product proliferation and stimulating changes in merchandising, inventory management, internal production practices, and methods of using human resources. When it comes to the driving force behind the late twentieth-century industrial transformation, lean retailing is at the forefront of that revolution.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
with rules<n>Vygotsky regarded the sociodramatic play of the preschool years as essential for further development of play—speciﬁcally, for movement toward game play in middle childhood. In make-believe, the rules of play are implicit; preschoolers are hardly aware of enacting them. Instead, they are caught up in creating imaginary situations—putting a stuffed animal to bed, driving an ambulance to a train crash, or ringing up a customer’s purchase at the cash register. Winning and losing, team membership and competition, and purposefully laying down rules are not of great interest to preschoolers. Try playing a rule-based game with a 3- or 4-year-old, and you are likely to ﬁnd that the child is easily sidetracked. If, with your prompting and guidance, the child does ﬁnish the game, he or she might say, “I won!” or “Everybody won!” regardless of the outcome.<n>With age, the imaginativeness of play recedes. In the games that captivate school-age children, rules come to the forefront.17 Six- to 8-year-olds are often preoccupied with working out the rules of a game and making sure all players follow them. They often spend as much or more time on the details of how a game should proceed as they do playing the game itself! Nevertheless, every organized game with rules contains an imaginary situation in veiled form. In Monopoly, children are real estate moguls; in baseball, they emulate Hall-of-Fame idols. Children retain both aspects of play, in changing balances, throughout development.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Low Rider<n>The expression “low rider” is used to describe the car, the subculture, and the person who drives a vehicle that has been lowered, rides very low, and has been customized. A car, truck, bicycle, van, or motorcycle that has been lowered—and this can be achieved by various methods—means that it sits very close to the ground and has a sleek streamlined appearance. The driver and/or owner is called a low rider and the act of low riding refers to all the activities associated with driving the car: cruising, caravanning, and hopping. Low riders have commonly been associated with cholos (1990s urban youth) and gangs, but traditionally Chicanos seriously involved in low riding and customizing low-rider cars are not involved in gangs, and low-rider clubs actually present an alternative to gang involvement. Low-rider car clubs communicate a message of cultural pride and unity. Although different, the cholo subculture can be closely linked to the low-rider subculture.<n>It is not clear when low riding started, but it was already a custom by the 1930s in Los Angeles and Sacramento, although the name “low rider” did not come into usage until the 1960s. After World War II, because of the growth in the economy, many Chicanos could afford to buy cars, old and new, and the practice of customizing cars and cruising became very popular throughout the Southwest and California during the 1950s. The most popular cars to lower are long ones, such as Fords, Buicks, and Chevrolets. Hydraulic lifts are used to lower and raise both the front and rear ends of a car. Before it was discovered that a hydraulic lift could be used with the batteries stored in the trunk of the car, different methods were used to lower the chassis of the car. Early crude methods were to place heavy bricks and cement bags in the trunk, or to cut the spring’s coils, or lower the car’s blocks. To give the car that lowered look the top might be cut back to lower the roof. In recent times, once a car is “lifted” or “all juiced up,” the driver controls the lift with a hand control.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
Low riders are usually young urban Chicanos, between the ages of eighteen and thirty, and there can be two and three generations of low riders in one family. The cost of fixing and maintaining a low-rider car is fairly high, so the owner typically is a working person. Since finding older cars, say from the 1950s, is becoming difficult, some low riders now customize small trucks, motorcycles, and bicycles as well. The movie Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life) depicts the work that goes into customizing a pickup truck.<n>Cruising involves driving very slowly up and down city streets, such as Mission Street in San Francisco, Whittier Boulevard in Los Angeles, and King and Story Roads in San Jose, California. The objective of cruising is to socialize, to see and be seen, to give others the opportunity to admire one’s car and to admire the other cars; consequently the driving must be very slow, muy despacito. Driving a great customized car, beautifully painted, is a unique experience for the low rider. Cruising slowly and smoothly, sitting low in the driver’s seat, glancing out at the street, nodding the head slightly when being recognized, all these make up an experience only a Chicano low rider who has invested lots of time and money in his car can appreciate. Cruising is often compared to the custom of promenading around a plaza, referred to as el paseo in many Latin American and Mexican cities. In this sense, the low-rider car becomes a cultural vehicle, as represented by the artist Gilbert Lujan in his series titled “Cultural Vehicles.”<n>A low-rider 1969 Ford LTD called “Dave’s Dream” is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington D.C., the first and only low-rider car in the museum. From Chimayo, New Mexico, Dennis Martinez, Richard Martinez, and David Jaramillo worked on customizing the car, starting in 1975. It has two hydraulic pumps, with the batteries stored in the truck, that lift and lower the car and can make it rock from side to side and give it an appearance of dancing. Actually “car dancing” is an event held at low-rider car shows.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
No one chose to create an American nation consisting of North and South, white and black, native and immigrant, and there were undoubtedly many people displeased by the idea. Yet, this was the situation in which we found ourselves in 1863. Lincoln had conceived of rooting our history in the identity generated by the struggle for independence. History had forged a unique nation of people of diverse origins. Justice Harlan understood what the nation had become and what it could do to further its own internal harmony. His magisterial dissent leaves us with a historical record of what constitutional thought in the postbellum period could have been.<n>Instead of integrating our nationhood and the commitment to equality into constitutional discourse, the Civil Rights Cases completed the process of driving Lincoln’s vision into the deep structure of our constitutional thought. The Court generated a surface discourse to camouflage the Secret Constitution. It bequeathed to us a narrow conception of state action that we are still struggling to overcome. And, more to the point, by undermining federal authority to remove the incidents and marks of slavery, the Court facilitated segregation in American society. It would be a mere dozen or so years until the Supreme Court upheld the idea that public facilities, including schools, might be “separate but equal”—thus institutionalizing apartheid for generations.53 At the same time that the courts drove the postbellum legal order underground, concerted action by the children of slave owners organized to frustrate the purposes of the Fifteenth Amendment. Various measures, including poll taxes, literacy tests, and organized violence, were used to prevent African Americans from realizing their right to vote. The Democratic Party gained the loyalty of white Southern voters and remained in power for more than half a century, largely on the basis of segregationist principles.54<n>Yet, there is an important difference between the courts’ betraying the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments and the people’s frustrating the purposes of the Fifteenth Amendment. With regard to the first two of the Reconstruction Amendments, the courts gutted the great aspirations of the new constitutional order and led many professorial observers to teach that our Constitution really was what the segregationist courts said it was. This tendency to take the Courts at face value derived largely from academic skepticism about the possibility of a higher law prevailing over the uses of judicial power in our understanding of what the Constitution really required.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
And the chemical case makes clear the linking of the flows of matter and energy in this sprawling chemical diversity explosion. Many such reactions will link exergonic and endergonic processes. As this occurs, energy is pumped from the exergonic partner into the products requiring endergonic synthesis. These products  the chemical diversity in the bark of a redwood tree, for example  take their place in the chemical actual, poising the biosphere, and thus the universe, for its next plunge into the chemical adjacent possible.<n>Consider again equilibrium statistical mechanics. At its core, statistical mechanics relies on the same kind of statistical argument as does the flipping of a fair coin , times. We all understand that distributions of roughly , heads and , tails are far more probable macrostates than distributions with all heads or all tails. Now consider the general argument I have made that as molecular diversity increases, the diversity of reactions increases even faster, and that there is a genuine chemical potential from the actual into the adjacent possible. And consider again the general argument made just above that the greater the diversity of molecular species and reactions, the more likely the coupling of exergonic and endergonic reaction pairs driving the endergonic synthesis of new adjacent possible molecules that poise the system to advance again into the next adjacent possible. While the detailed statistical form of these chemical reaction graphs are not yet known, they too smell of “law.” As in the case of fair coin flips and equilibrium statistical mechanics, it is as if here again the mathematical structure compels the consequent behavior of matter and energy. In the case of the nonergodic and nonequilibrium chemical flux into the adjacent possible, the universe is busy diversifying itself into myriad complexity.<n>The universe is enormously complex, and we don’t really yet know why. May there be new ways of thinking of the cosmos itself? If a mere glimmer can be acceptable as potentially useful early science, then the burden of this chapter is to suggest perhaps, yes.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt
All spontaneous chemical reactions, if coupled to no other source of energy, are exergonic. On the other hand, if some other free energy source is coupled to the reaction, the reaction can be driven “beyond equilibrium” by using some of the energy source. Reactions that are driven beyond equilibrium by addition of free energy are called endergonic. Thus X might convert to Y, and this reaction might be coupled to another source of free energy, such that the steady state concentration of Y is much higher than the normal equilibrium X:Y ratio (Figure 3.3).<n>In the Carnot cycle, completion of the work cycle involved the cylinder piston system doing exergonic work on the external world during the power stroke, then the outside world doing work on the cylinder piston system when you pushed on the piston to recompress the working gas. The Carnot cycle links mechanical and thermal energy sources into a work cycle. A chemical reaction network with a work cycle will have to link spontaneous, exergonic and nonspontaneous, endergonic reactions into the chemical analogue of a work cycle. Like the cyclic Carnot engine, the chemical analogue will have to work in a cycle of states, like the 1, 2, 3, 4, 1 cycle of the Carnot cycle. Further, in order for the cycle to operate at a finite rate, hence irreversibly, the autonomous agent must be an open thermodynamic system driven by outside sources of matter or energy = hence “food” = and the continual driving of the system by such “food” holds the system away from equilibrium.<n>In this light, think again of the Ghadiri autocatalytic system, the 32-amino-acid sequence A that ligates two fragments A’, a 15-amino-acid fragment, and A”, a 17-amino-acid fragment, into A. This reaction is purely exergonic. The reaction proceeds from the substrate fragments A’ and A’’ to form the product molecule A and approaches the equilibrium ratio of substrates to product. Ghadiri’s autocatalytic system is wonderful, but merely exergonic. It does not achieve a work cycle. In general, autocatalytic and collectively autocatalytic systems can be purely exergonic. In any such case, no work cycle is achieved.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
And the central factors underlying that buildup of organization are the same factors that apply in an economy = that merely human extension of biospheres. The central factors, in fact, center on “advantages of trade.” We can see this keystone concept by supposing that you and I are the only members of a tiny economy. You begin life with an endowment of a thousand pears and a hundred apples. I begin life with an endowment of a hundred pears and a thousand apples. Suppose your happiness, or “utility,” would increase if you had fewer rather than more pears and more rather than fewer apples. Alas, you have more pears than apples. I, in turn, happen to have desires such that I would be happier with rather more pears than apples. Alas, I have more apples than pears.<n>You and I have advantages of trade. We can both be happier if we swap some of my apples for some of your pears. It is essential to understand that, indeed, both of us can be better oV by trading. Advantages of trade are the fundamental factor driving trade itself in an economy. In an actual simple economic model, advantages of trade are studied in an “Edgeworth box.” Edgeworth invented a two-dimensional box representation of values, or “worths,” plotted along the edge of his box (Figure 3.6). In the Edgeworth box, I am represented at the bottom-left corner, you are represented at the top-right corner. A family of equal happiness, or “isoutility” curves, show your “isohappiness” trade-oVs of apples and pears at any total abundance to you of apples and pears. You are, in general, happier the more total apples and pears you have. Your happiness landscape increases from low to high like a cone-shaped mountain whose peak is located over my head. On that peak, you have all the apples and pears in the system.<n>My isohappiness trade-oV curves begin low at the lower-left corner and mount to a peak over your head in the upper-right corner, when I would have all the apples and pears.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Maxwell asks us to consider the very same box with N particles in it. But he imagines the box to be divided into two chambers by a wall with a window in it. In the window is a flap valve. When the flap valve is open, gas particles can pass from the left to the right box via the window, or from the right to the left box via the window.<n>Now, smiles Maxwell, suppose the initial state of the gas in the box is in the equilibrium macrostate. No macroscopic work can be done by the equilibrium system. That was Carnot’s central point. There is plenty of energy in the random motions of the gas particles, but there is no means to extract mechanical work from it, say, to drive a piston. Next, says Maxwell, warming to his point, “Imagine that my wee friend operates the flap valve such that, whenever a fast gas particle approaches the window from inside the left box toward the right box, he opens the flap and lets the faster than average, hence hotter, gas particle through. And suppose my demon also operates the flap value to let the slower than average, hence cooler, gas particles pass from the right to the left box. Well, soon the left box will be cool and the right box will be hot. And now,” concludes Maxwell with a broad smile, “we can use the macroscopic temperature dierence between the left and right boxes to extract mechanical work, say, by driving a piston.”<n>There you have it. Maxwell posed a severe question for statistical mechanics and the second law. It appeared that the actions of the demon might circumvent the second law.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
We are struggling with a circle of concepts involving work, constraint, constraint construction, propagating work, measurements, couplings, energy, records, matter, processes, events, information, and organization. It has been said by many that we do not understand the linking of matter, energy, and information. The circle above points at something we must trouble ourselves to understand, and I suspect that the triad of matter, energy, and information is insucient. Rather, the missing “something” concerns organization. While we have, it seems, adequate concepts of matter, energy, entropy, and information, we lack a coherent concept of organization, its emergence, and self-constructing propagation and self-elaboration.<n>If we do not yet understand organization fully, we can at least think about what happens in autonomous agents such as real cells. A real cell, a real molecular autonomous agent, does in fact carry out self-reproduction. In addition, it carries out one or more real work cycles, linking spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes. It does, in fact, measure, detect, and record sources of energy and does do work to construct constraints on the release of energy, which when released in the constrained way, propagates to do more work, often constructing further constraints on the release of energy or doing work by driving further nonspontaneous processes. Cells do achieve propagating work.<n>The work propagating in a cell achieves a “closure” in a set of propagating work tasks such that the cell literally constructs a rough copy of itself. In a later chapter I will return to discussing “tasks,” which turn out on a Darwinian analysis to be a subset of the causal consequences of the release of energy at a point and time in the system. For the moment, I want to focus on the concept of a closure in a set of propagating “work tasks.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt

But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents, it would seem, is also graced by the selfsame know-how. If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms, they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt
I believe, and it is a matter of central importance if I am correct, that the answer is no. I do not think it is possible to finitely prestate all the context-dependent causal consequences of parts of creatures that might turn out to be useful in some weird environment and hence be selected. I’m not yet certain how to prove that this is not possible, although I will have a try at it below.<n>Another way of stating what I am driving at is this: Is there a finitely prestatable set of all the possible potential biological functions? Again, I think the answer is no. Yet another way of stating this is to say that there is no finite prestatement of the configuration space of a biosphere. We cannot say ahead of time all the possible constellations of matter, energy, process, and organization that is a kind of “basis set” for a biosphere in the sense that the atomic chart of the elements is a finite basis set for all of chemistry.<n>It is time for a story. A particularly ugly squirrel named Gertrude was atop a tree 65,433,872 years ago. Gertrude was ugly because she had folds of skin from her forearms stretching to her hind limbs. So ugly was Gertrude that she was shunned by the other squirrels and was sadly alone atop a magnolia tree eating lunch. But just yards away, high in a pine, was Bertha, an owl. Bertha spotted Gertrude and thought, “Lunch!” Bertha flashed downward through shafts of light toward Gertrude. Gertrude looked suddenly up and was terrified. “GAAAAAAH,” she cried and jumped in desperation from the top of the magnolia tree, flinging her arms and legs wide in terror.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
Now a second simple point. The molecular species of the actual exist. Those in the adjacent possible do not exist  at least within the volume of the universe we are talking about, which we can expand in a moment to be the actual molecular diversity of the entire universe, not just our tiny patch of it.<n>The chemical potential of a single reaction with a single set of substrates and no products is perfectly definable, both the enthalpy and entropy. But we hardly need that sophistication. The substrates are present in the actual, and the products are not present in the actual, but only in the adjacent possible. It follows that every such reaction couple is displaced from its equilibrium in the direction of an excess of substrates compared to its products. This displacement constitutes a chemical potential driving the reaction toward equilibrium. The simple conclusion is that there is a real chemical potential from the actual to the adjacent possible. Other things being equal, the total system “wants” to flow into the adjacent possible.<n>If there are to trillion organic molecules in the biosphere and each pair of organic molecules can undergo at least one two substrate–two product reaction, then the diversity of reactions is the square of the diversity of molecular species, hence about x = . Some substantial fraction of these reactions flow from the actual to the adjacent possible. The total chemical potential from the actual into the adjacent possible is hard to estimate, but it is certainly not small.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
Vince and I want to say that natural rationality is bounded to models of intermediate complexity because we collectively and persistently create nonstationary worlds together. In the agent-based computer models Vince has created for his thesis, just this behavior is seen. Indeed, we allow agents to evolve how much of the past history of the interactions they will pay attention to and how complex their models of one another will be  one, four, or fifty Fourier modes. Agents evolve in a history and complexity space to find currently optimal amounts of history and complexity to use to optimally predict their neighbors. In our little world, the agents evolve to use a modest history, ignoring the distant past, and only modestly complex theories of one another.<n>We have found evidence of a further, perhaps generic, property that appears to drive such systems to settle down, then change in a sudden burst. As the system of agents and actions settles down to some repeatable behavior, an increasingly wide range of alternative theories, simple and very complex, fit the same data. But the complex theories, with many Fourier modes, attempt to predict fine details of the repeatable behavior. As those theories become more complex, they are more fragile because they can be disconfirmed by ever more minor fluctuations in the repeatable behavior. Sooner or later such a fluctuation happens, and the agents with the complex disconfirmed theories change theories and actions radically, setting up a vast avalanche of changes of theories and actions that sweeps the system, driving the collective behavior far from any repeatable pattern. In these new circumstances, only a small subset of theories fits the current facts, so the diversity, and complexity, of theories in the population of agents plummets, and the system finds its way back to some repeatable pattern of behavior.<n>In short, there appears to be not only a bounded complexity in our rationality, but a fragility - stability cyclic oscillation in our joint theories and actions as well. In these terms, the system of agents and theories never settles down to a fixed-point equilibrium in which markets clear. Instead, the system repeatedly fluctuates away from the contract curve then returns to new points in the vicinity of the contract curve. Hence, in precisely the sense of repeatedly fluctuating away from a contract curve then returning to its vicinity, the system does not achieve an optimizing price equilibrium, but satisfices.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
As we have seen, over the past million years, and even the past hundred years, the diversity of the economic web has increased. Why? Because, as in Lego World, the more objects there are in the economy, the more complement and substitute relations exist among those objects, as well as potential new objects in the adjacent possible. If there are N objects, the number of potential complement or substitute relations scales at least as N squared since each object might be a complement or substitute of any object. Thus, as the diversity of the objects in the web increases, the diversity of prospective niches for new goods and services increases even more rapidly! The very diversity of the economic web is autocatalytic.<n>If this view is correct, then diversity of goods and services is a major driver of economic growth. Indeed, I believe that the role of diversity of goods and services is the major unrecognized factor driving economic growth. Jane Jacobs had made the same point in her thoughtful books about the relation between economic growth and economic diversity of cities and their hinterlands. Economist Jose Scheinkman, now chairman of economics at the University of Chicago, and his colleagues studied a number of cities, normalized for total capitalization, and found that economic growth correlated with economic diversity in the city. In a similar spirit, microfinancing of a linked diversity of cottage businesses in the third world and the first world seems to be achieving local economic growth where more massive eorts at education and infrastructure, Aswan dams and power grids, seem to fail.<n>Indeed, in the same way in an ecosystem, organisms create niches for other organisms. I suspect, therefore, that over the past . billion years, the growth of diversity of species is autocatalytic, for the number of possible niches increases more rapidly than the number of species filling niches. And in the linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes, the universe as a whole advances autocatalytically into its adjacent possible, driven by the very increase of diversity by which novel displacements from equilibrium come into existence, are detected, are coupled to, and come to drive the endergonic creation of novel kinds of molecules and other entities. Economic growth is part and parcel of the creativity of the universe as a whole.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt

The Algarve stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to Spain, but it’s actually a small region. Faro, the capital, is just 50 km (30 miles) from the Spanish border, and it is only 112 km (70 miles) west of what was known in medieval times as o fim do mundo (the end of the world) at Sagres. Along this 160-km (100-mile) coastal strip, resorts and holiday villages of all stripes have sprung up, so wherever you are based, you’ll never be far from a good beach, a reasonably sized town, village, or resort, shops, and nightlife.<n>The following pages cover the Algarve traveling west to east, though you could certainly do the reverse or begin in the center, near Faro (or anywhere you elect to stay) and embark on day trips both east and west from there. For those with additional time and interest in seeing more of Portugal, a brief section on the Portuguese capital Lisbon and its seductive environs is included. Lisbon is about four hours by car (and 40 minutes by plane) from Faro; it should be conceived as an add-on to your visit to the Algarve rather than a day trip. Many people visit the Algarve by flying into Lisbon and driving to the southern coast. If you are flying directly to the international airport at Faro and wish to spend a few days in the Lisbon area, it would make sense to see about a return flight from there.<n>World’s End: Sagres and Cabo de São Vicente<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
On the south side of the marina, accessible from the main beach road, is the Underwater Explorers Society or UNEXSO. The oldest diving organization in the Bahamas, UNEXSO provides diving experience sessions and training courses. The large square building contains a diving pool and decompression chamber; those with no interest in actually practicing the sport can visit the museum, which charts the development of diving to the modern SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) method developed by Jacques Cousteau in the 1930s. There is also a good restaurant on site, the Brass Helmet. A short boatride from Port Lucaya takes you to Sanctuary Bay and the UNEXSO Dolphin Experience. A family of bottlenose dolphins have set up home here. You can linger by the side of the bay and hope they come to you, get in the water and swim with them, or spend a day as an assistant trainer and help the staff care for these gentle creatures.<n>Just north of the Marina is the Lucayan Golf and Country Club, which has some of the best-groomed greens in the Bahamas and a very good restaurant for those who want to watch rather than play — diners enjoy panoramic views over the driving range and several holes.<n>Freeport-Lucaya may be a modern town of concrete and tarmac, but within the city limits are two natural areas that could be a million miles away from the bustle of the shops and large hotels.

At Nusa Dua, the outside world — even the everyday Balinese world — is excluded. The name, meaning “two islands,” refers to two knobs of land sticking out from the coast in the middle of the reserve. They are not true islands but are each connected by a narrow neck of land. As at Sanur, when the tide is out, the water is too low for swimming, but most Nusa Dua hotels have vast swimming pools. There’s little traffic or noise, and no hassle from hawkers in this neatly manicured expensive hotel zone. A dozen luxury hotels sprawl amid spacious grounds next to dazzling white beaches, with two championship golf courses, a convention center at the Sheraton Nusa Indah Hotel, and the Galleria, a modern shopping and restaurant complex in the same area. Predictably, lower-priced hotels and affordable eating places line the 5 km (3 miles) of coast north of Nusa Dua’s hotel zone, all the way to Benoa. Once a dusty, somnolent fishing village, Benoa has turned into a watersports center of buzzing jet skis, motorboats, diving centers, and bars.<n>Don’t confuse Benoa village (Tanjung Benoa) with Benoa Port, on the opposite (north) side of the muddy inlet known as Benoa Harbor. Reached from the Sanur-Kuta road by a long causeway, the harbor is where cargo ships tie up. There is a charge for driving along the causeway to the jetty, and no reason for going to the end unless you plan to take the fast twin-hull, Maubua Express ferry to Lombok, a cruise to Nusa Lembongan, or a deep-sea fishing trip.<n>Jimbaran Beach is a great arc of sand facing a sheltered bay south of the airport, shared by a handful of resort hotels and a fishing village. More hotels are rapidly going up on a new access road that runs parallel to the coast here. Look for the sign to Uluwatu on the road from the airport toward Nusa Dua — you have to pass it and then make a U-turn. Jimbaran Beach is famous for its restaurants that serve fresh grilled fish and seafood on the beach.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Beijing also offers bungee jumping (at the Shidu Bungee Jumping Facility in the Fangshan District), paintball (at Color Me Purple in Wanfangting Park), rock climbing (at the Qidagudu Climbing Club in the Xuanwu District), horseback riding (check with the Movenpick Hotel), and shooting (at the China North Shooting Range near the Great Wall Badaling — where even machine guns are for rent).<n>Golf. Beijing’s top course is the Beijing International Golf Club, located near the Ming Tombs. The Beijing Grand Canal Golf Club, east of Beijing, has night golf. Near the airport, the Beijing Country Golf Club provides 36 holes. The newest championship golf course, designed by Graham Marsh, is the Huatang International Golf. The closest course to the city is the Chaoyang Golf Club, a 9-hole course with a driving range. All these courses are open to the public (make reservations through your hotel), and they rent clubs and provide caddies. Greens fees start at about 1,000 yuan.<n>Bowling. Modern bowling lanes enjoyed a boom in Beijing during the 1990s, with alleys located in the Holiday Inn Lido, Beijing International, and other hotels. The bowling alley in the lower basement of the China World Hotel has special off-hour rates during the day.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhatToDo.txt
World War II<n>In the autumn of 1938, Hitler was put out that Berliners did not share his enthusiasm for the cavalcade of troops driving through the city. The army was preparing its march into what used to be Czechoslovakia, but onlookers shared none of the fervor that had greeted military parades in 1914.<n>Their disquiet was shortly to be justified by the hail of bombs on the capital. The first attacks came in 1940 from the British in retaliation for the air raids on London. Attacks were stepped up after the German defeat at Stalingrad in 1943, with Anglo-American “carpet-bombing.” The worst single raid was on 6 February 1945, when bombs wiped out 4 sq km (1 1⁄2 sq miles) of the city center in one hour.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt
Billiards and bowling. “Billiards,” which also includes ten-pin bowling, snooker, and pool, is a very popular pastime in Budapest. For a list of venues ask Tourinform or see the Sports and Leisure section in the Budapest Sun.<n>Golf. This is a newcomer to Hungary, and you will have to drive some way out of town if you want to play. The Budapest Golf Course is a 9-hole, par 36 course with driving range, 35 km (22 miles) north at Kisoroszi (tel. 1170-6025). Bookings are required. The nearest 18-hole course is 200 km (120 miles) away to the west in Bükk.<n>Horseback riding. There are numerous good stables and horse-riding schools just outside Budapest, and riding holidays around the Balaton area and farther aﬁeld are on offer at Budapesti Equestrian Club (tel. 313-5210) and Petoreházy Club Hotel (tel. 176-5937). Ask Tourinform for details, pay a visit to the aptly-named Pegazus Tours on Fereciek tere, or see the IBUSZ brochure, Riding in Hungary.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhatToDo.txt
Marin County<n>Immediately north of San Francisco are two charming waterfront towns — Sausalito and Tiburon — which you can reach either by driving across the Golden Gate Bridge or by taking a ferry — from the Ferry Building at the foot of Market Street, or Pier 41 near Fisherman’s Wharf.<n>Tiburon is the quieter of the two, while Sausalito is more of a tourist trap, but both have a colorful Mediterranean atmosphere, with art galleries, yacht harbors, craft shops, and pleasant bistros and cafés out on the boardwalk overlooking the bay.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
Accommodatingly situated on the border between Ontario and Québec, Ottawa is a fully bilingual city, though most of the French-speaking community (and the best restaurants) now have their homes in Hull on the Québec side of the Ottawa River.<n>Except for longer excursions, try to leave the car in the hotel parking lot and walk or take the bus. The complex system of one-way streets designed to avoid rather than to reach key government buildings, and the added confusion of curving rivers and canals, make downtown driving a harrowing business even for locals. One other point: In the absence of any clear logic in street numbering, it’s important when noting an address to be sure you have the nearest cross-streets as well as the number of the building.<n>Parliament Area<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Highway 4 follows the lake shore to Cathedral Grove, a formidable stand of Douglas firs in MacMillan Provincial Park, donated to the public by a paper manufacturer as a gesture for government permission to exploit less accessible parts of the forest. Many of the firs, up to 76 m (230 ft) high, are more than 300 years old, the most ancient dating back to the 12th century. Excellent explanatory panels trace the growth of these majestic trees. Off the beaten track, you’ll steep yourself in the atmosphere of a truly primeval forest.<n>Stock up on picnic supplies in the town of Port Alberni before driving on past Kennedy Lake and down to Pacific Rim National Park. Its sandy beaches are a delight, the powerful ocean-breakers being particularly admired by champion surfers. At the coast, Highway 4 turns north along one of the best resort areas, the self-explanatory Long Beach, 12 km (7 miles) of fine sand and first-class fishing waters. Hotels here provide you with cooking facilities for whatever fish you — or a generous neighbor — might catch. The boardwalk that rambles along Wickaninnish Bay will take you in and out of the coastal pine forest. Florencia Bay is a good bathing beach, while South Bay is the mecca for collectors of “worry stones.” These exquisite green, aubergine, or (most prized of all) jet black pebbles are gathered from hidden nooks and crannies, sorted for size, shape, and smoothness of texture until the ideal stone is located, a highly subjective appraisal. All others are discarded and the collector can be seen caressing the pebble, rubbing all worries away. From Comber’s Beach, you can spot sea lions basking out on the rocks, with not a worry in the world.<n>For a change of pace, the sleepy town of Tofino is a community of ecologists, painters, and poets pursuing a style of life remote in every sense from the B.C. mainstream. Take a look at the Indian art gallery and performances at the experimental theater.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Population: 17,000<n>La Gomera is, indeed, a dramatic and rugged mountainous island. It has a coastline that is dominated by dramatic cliffs — there are very few beaches, and the interior is full of vertiginous, mostly verdant, valleys that are often lined with narrow fields stepped into the sides of the mountains. For extra effect these valleys are more often than not covered by a ceiling of cloud, whisked in by the trade winds, which seem to perpetually hang over the island. In the center, there is the unusually dense growth of trees and fauna in what is the Parque Nacional Garajonay (open Tuesday–Sunday 9:30am–4:30pm). Less than 20 km (121⁄2 miles) from north to south, this amazing island has been declared a Property of Humanity by UNESCO. In fact, a third of the island, 12,450 hectares (30,774 acres) has been designated into seventeen protected areas. Such terrain, though, makes for difficulty in getting around, and even the Romans, had they ventured this way, would have found their legendary ability to build straight roads put to an impossible test. In fact, almost nowhere on the island will you find a straight stretch of road, everywhere you go the roads twist and turn continually, often turning back on themselves in hairpin bends. Making driving even more complicated is the fact that the roads, although improving, are often of poor quality, and the directional signs leave much to be desired.<n>Just 40 minutes away from Tenerife, La Gomera nevertheless remains unspoiled and authentic, with its steep, green, terraced hills and tranquil valleys.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
Ronda<n>The opening of an improved road from San Pedro de Alcántara to Ronda has ended the isolation of this mountain area, and shortened the driving time from the coast to an hour. One of the most spectacularly situated towns in Europe, Ronda sits atop a cliff-bound plateau, cleaved through the middle by a sheer-sided gorge. The older, Moorish part of town (La Ciudad) lies to the south of the ravine, linked by an 18th-century bridge to El Mercadillo, the modern district that arose after the Reconquista.<n>The gorge, known as El Tajo, is a deep and narrow crevasse that plunges 150 m (490 ft) to the foaming Río Guadalevín, a tributary of the Guadiaro River. During the Civil War, nationalist sympathizers in the town were hurled to their deaths in the gorge, an event recalled by Hemingway in his novel For Whom the Bell Tolls. You can enjoy a superb view of the Tajo and the patchwork of fields beyond from the Puente Nuevo (New Bridge), built in 1788, as well as from the walkways that follow the edge of the gorge.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
There are beaches and excellent diving farther west, near Playa María la Gorda, but for most visitors the star attractions are the irresistible town of Viñales and its beautiful valley. Many visitors take organized daytrips of the region from Havana hotels, but an overnight stay in Viñales — overlooking the valley — is highly recommended.<n>Start your explorations by driving west on the autopista (highway) linking Havana with the province’s capital city of Pinar del Río. About 63 km (39 miles) along the highway, a turnoff leaves the level, palm-dotted plains for Soroa, where a richly endowed botanical garden nestles in the mountain foothills near a tired little tourist complex. A guided tour reveals an orchid garden, lychee and mango trees, coffee plants, and splendid specimens of jagüey and ceiba trees. A restaurant in the villa of Castillo de las Nubes on a nearby mountain has stunning views.<n>At the end of the highway, 175 km (109 miles) west of Havana, the small city of Pinar del Río is a bustling commercial center. Along the main street, Calle José Martí, low-rise neoclassical buildings in blues, yellows, greens, and orange have a stately but dilapidated quality. In backstreet houses men make homemade cigars; you’ll find a small, interesting tobacco factory, Francisco Donatien Fábrica de Tobacos, housed in an old jail below the Plaza de la Independencia. Visitors are welcome here and at the less picturesque Casa Garay Rum Factory, on Avenida Isabel Rubio, where they make a local rum liqueur called guayabita del Pinar.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
Upriver from the sandbank at its mouth, the Douro runs between Porto and the port lodges of Vila Nova de Gaia, passing beneath a series of impressive bridges and on towards port-wine territory. The railway line from Porto skips the first 60 km (37 miles) of the river — but this is the least interesting stretch. The line eventually joins the river near Ribadouro, proceeding along the northern bank, past small towns and fields where the haystacks, set on cross-shaped supports, look from a distance like scarecrows.<n>Attractive Amarante sits on a gorge of the Tâmega (a tributary of the Douro) and makes a good stop if you are driving along the road from Porto towards Mesã Frio and Régua. Baronial mansions with gaily painted balconies overlooking the river line the streets. Rising above a handsome stone arched bridge and leafy park, the church of the former 16th-century monastery of São Gonçalo is well worth a visit, especially if you are looking for love: It hosts a pilgrimage in June for women seeking husbands (with the exchange of phallic-shaped cakes—a remarkably literal step in the mating dance).<n>The river bends and twists, widens and narrows among green terraced hills. The port trade prompted the growth of Peso da Régua (usually called just Régua), 70 km (43 miles) east of Porto. Régua was once the main port used to ship young wines downriver in barcos rabelos (flat-bottomed wooden boats) to Vila Nova de Gaia. Though the railways took over for transport from Pinhão (at the confluence of the Douro and Pinhão rivers), and today the wine goes mostly by road, Régua remains an important transportation and commercial hub.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
