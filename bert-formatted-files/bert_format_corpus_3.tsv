they were the ones that caused it or whatever but to me when you do the crime then you should pay for whatever you did and and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge i don't i don't think that's right because all's that's	going	to do is say oh well you know that was a breeze i can go out and do it again and you know yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3113-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

sort of hat and you never know that though sometimes when you're	going	in do you no but because i sort of stick to several schools uh i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and you never know that though sometimes when you're	going	in do you no but because i sort of stick to several schools uh i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah of what's	going	on that so that's and i don't know you know i i think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know are they put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh i don't know that that looks that bad but if you're	going	to tell the kids they can have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too yeah it it i see that the i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers i think	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're	going	there you don't want to dress too tacky because you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well and you always course it's a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today or there there's or you're	going	to be observed there's usually yeah there's usually something	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
or you're	going	to be observed there's usually yeah there's usually something	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
really and i don't know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the kids i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and i don't think we'll ever get to that no i don't think i think we're	going	the opposite direction it's the parochial schools that i guess many times they've had uniforms for years i really don't really know if they still do you don't think so	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well i think it does it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete Highland Park's thinking about	going	that route uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so it and then i think that's	going	to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do yeah i i don't think a lot of teachers are very professional but	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but how about you yeah i i enjoy	going	out but my husband goes out for dinner a lot with his company you know with his work uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah it's kind of an interesting approach yeah we we thought that was that wasn't too bad but most of the time you know i was really surprised like i say	going	at these so	#telephone#	telephone_sw3116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh our son has this kind of you know he's well he started out	going	Stephen F Austin and that turned turned into you know flunking out because of of of uh too many parties	#telephone#	telephone_sw3117-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and uh for more than just academics  but you know if it's a party school or not although i think every school  is a party school to some degree personally well that's true of course uh you know for me my son he's only six and but i had the experience with my sister	going	to school and she was i treated my sister almost like my daughter because she was nine ten years younger than i was and it's right	#telephone#	telephone_sw3117-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah i think that for me it's	going	to be one of those things yes i want to make sure it has a good education but i also want to keep it small enough that you can enjoy it because Texas to me was almost too big yeah i've heard that from people who have gone to Texas yeah i went to uh Iowa State which is also a big eight school like Oklahoma	#telephone#	telephone_sw3117-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah  so uh but you know i guess you have to really look at your finances and uh Texas has such a bargain in education i mean right now they do now if the uh legislature has their way they're	going	to raise the tuition in in double yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3117-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i had to be very careful about talking about seniors or fourth year students  you got to get the terminology right well i tell you what i've enjoyed talking i'm	going	to go ahead and hang up on this end because it's just about time for supper so yes	#telephone#	telephone_sw3117-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and we have so many people already you know the jails are already overloaded well the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous i mean if one is determined that it's you know that he feels that he's you know	going	against the other eleven they all stay until everyone agrees so i don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting you know just gives in	#telephone#	telephone_sw3118-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i i think it's just i don't i mean i think it's as fair as it can possibly get but i just think it's really hard you know i mean some cases go on for years you know that's true and i've never been on jury duty but they have to keep	going	and	#telephone#	telephone_sw3118-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

because yes dogs need training but cats usually don't even need any training seem like they automatically go to their little litter box they think yeah yeah no they usually don't yeah yeah so anyway we've had that that was a very bad experience  well i don't really think we're	going	to have any more indoor pets well in fact if we're getting ready to go on our vacation my little six year old now he's saying we need to buy a mother dog to take care of uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3122-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

i don't know something's got to change with the schools that's what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway when they're young well i think it's	going	to have to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else the home is the base yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3140-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum well i'm thinking of a next time about	going	back to a dog though because the cats really do shed a lot you just never get rid of the cat hair do they	#telephone#	telephone_sw3141-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
we never back then you didn't spay and neuter your animals that much you just kind of put up with whatever happened and she could never get rid of them fast enough before the next litter came along it wasn't usual unusual for us to have six and seven cats and i remember my first camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of them that were	going	to be award winning type  photos they've always been a part of my life well i guess so you've had them so you had them just from early on then	#telephone#	telephone_sw3141-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right especially if you really do get attached to them i'm i'm already kind of preparing for Prissy dying because she's pretty old and fat and oh i just know it's	going	to come sooner or later so that's one reason i've been letting Emily talk about dogs because i think uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3141-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh we we say that's	going	to be the end but i think when it really comes to it we'll want another pet how old is Prissy	#telephone#	telephone_sw3141-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

it it like you said it is it is cheaper on yourself to to go ahead and do it yourself than go spend fifty sixty dollars to have somebody else you know just change your oil or something like that i mean it must be great to to to really understand what's what's	going	on and you can both do things yourself and  talk confidently with people when you have to take it somewhere to get parts or whatever yeah yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3358-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

well you you know you you could carry it uh to that if uh if they are a repeat offender and and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are	going	to do this unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up um you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes and of course uh uh battery or assault or that's not a capital crime so you you wouldn't be able to under our system	#telephone#	telephone_sw3367-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum when the bill came and when we moved down here and everything was	going	on the credit card i think we we got a little rampant we you know went out to eat out everything and you know we'd we'd have to go to Wet and Wild and we had to basically play tourists the first	#telephone#	telephone_sw3370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs no but one thing that to to me was um	going	on stretching it a little too far was that they also check um if you're taking somebody else's prescription drug you know it happens a lot of times like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever and you know then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the you know doctor and get another prescription	#telephone#	telephone_sw3372-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and less money to do it with that's true and a lot of it lot of it has to do with uh salaries too speaking of money because if you can't pay the right people you know they're not	going	to be able to do they're not not gonna get the people that can do a good job all right yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3375-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i i know when i uh was	going	to school it it wasn't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving i mean they do that now and they could probably lose their job exactly right	#telephone#	telephone_sw3375-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Barry okay well i don't uh much well actually hardly at all i um the only times that i've actually golfed is we we were uh	going	to a family reunion up in Maine every year and a bunch of the brother-in-laws and whatever else would go out and play like couple times during the week that we were all there um	#telephone#	telephone_sw3376-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

right and i think it's moved in the right direction i now i think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight you know it's not	going	to it didn't happen here overnight and it didn't happen here without a struggle yep no	#telephone#	telephone_sw3379-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

uh yeah i i don't uh i guess uh i i kind of do the same thing i kind of think well you know i mean if if at least if we had weren't	going	all out to win it maybe it would have been worth something but then again i i uh probably too much of a dub my self to really	#telephone#	telephone_sw3380-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

a year a year ago now when the the war Desert Storm was finishing up seems like things were uh	going	to settle down and nothing seems to of seems to have settled down after all yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4030-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i i i i have very much doubt that that there's a real understanding at the top levels of of the of the cultures and of what's	going	on uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4030-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
which will suck up your money real quick yeah yeah it really will so we're you know we're	going	to have to really take a hard look at our uh expenses and things like that and uh you know really make the dollars uh go a little bit further if we can and we uh had not been paying very much for housing uh since we moved to Dallas in July	#telephone#	telephone_sw4031-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

so how do you get most of your current event information well during see i'm	going	to school right now and uh while i'm working i don't get a i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful i would imagine	going	to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah talking with people and just hearing what's	going	on but do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like the McNeil Lehrer Hour	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i think i think the uh i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff	going	on but um it seems that um they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news right and i think even in the elections they choose who they're	going	to follow and who they're not and basically you know if a candidate candidate can get them to follow then the news will yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah exactly i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's	going	on uh-huh uh because they can they can only report on i mean they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah and you know and and your catastrophes catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really don't know what's	going	on yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

it you know and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information what kind of uh see i subscribe to like Science News and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of what's	going	on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about right i	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the war when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was	going	on but a lot of the times oh yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

what do you think people's concern is about benefits is it mostly in the area of health care i swear that's what i was	going	to say we seem to get more more uh complaints about that than about anything else although you get a good deal of complaints over other kinds of insurance too um yeah health care we have we are on the state health system which is my understanding is that it is a lot worse than the system we had when we had our own just for the university	#telephone#	telephone_sw4085-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and it worked to some degree but it didn't work that much and the reason was adverse selection the people that go into HMO's are are those that have uh you know that that have generally lesser health needs and i mean it's obvious why that is because the people that that that are already sick are	going	to see a particular doctor and they don't want to switch just to come in the HMO so you get the people in the H O they they don't uh you know require that much uh care at all and then some how you got less people paying premiums into the into the uh insurance system than you have uh uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4085-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

but it seems hypocritical to me that we'd say in the case of murder for instance that uh because you took away somebody else's life and because that is so very wrong we are	going	to take away your life i don't see that that makes any sense really well it's not necessarily someone has the right but we do have the responsibility to punish criminals	#telephone#	telephone_sw4111-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but i think life imprisonment is a much better alternative to uh people that perform crimes i think also people that are prone to commit a murder are not	going	to be deterred by the thought of being put to death i think that if they're uh the sort of mentality that they could do such a thing that it doesn't matter what threat you pose to them that that wouldn't change things as far as what they were capable of doing so i don't see it as much of a deterrent either	#telephone#	telephone_sw4111-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

well the thing with the police is that they're only good to pick up the pieces after the crime has happened we have to to take precautions to defend ourselves uh if someone comes after you with a gun there's no way that the police are	going	to stop them uh even if have an opportunity to call the police uh because someone has threatened you they won't come out and protect you all they can do is investigate a crime after it's been committed it's very rare that they prevent one	#telephone#	telephone_sw4140-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
what the electorate seems to be telling them the problem is of course is that the majority of the people in this country have no idea what the right to keep and bear arms means or what it's for and all they see is rampant crime in the streets and they think that banning guns is	going	to stop that but that's that's simply not the case uh you take away the guns uh from law-abiding people and uh i mean it it seems like a trite phrase but	#telephone#	telephone_sw4140-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you take away the guns uh from law-abiding people and uh i mean it it seems like a trite phrase but if if guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns they're not	going	to stop the drug dealers and the criminals from from getting uh guns of any sort and what they really need to do is attack the root causes of of crime that's true yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4140-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

that's right so they're	going	to tell you what sells and also although i don't believe this is really that rampant at now uh you know sponsors or or advertisers could have some influence as well over over what uh eventually gets printed i uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4235-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well i think that's uh it's kind of related to like who writes history because obviously the the news eventually does become history it's just always	going	to be someone's the prevailing opinion yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4235-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh but i'm very you know i you know i've gotten it's i i it's funny how you get older and you don't know what's	going	on in popular music at all like who are some of the heavy metal um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4236-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and then uh at work this actually kind of a funny story uh for a long time the the guys who ran the company i work for we're kind of resistant to uh any kind of recycling because they felt like it was just	going	to cost them money or something yeah that's kind of reasonable	#telephone#	telephone_sw4239-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

you know it's well it's actually can go both ways something some ways you have more opportunities because there're so many things	going	on within the company but you also may get key holed and you are a ex type person therefore you should only work on this type project	#telephone#	telephone_sw4240-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
we're recycling uh all the cans the glass bottles all the plastic and the newspapers which that's great i really feel like uh community sponsorship is	going	to be one of the keys to uh recycling success um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4241-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah space exploration i think is not uh those developments we make in order to accomplish it but those things that we discover that we have no idea we're	going	to discover it's it's all the surprises the problem with that is you can't sure	#telephone#	telephone_sw4246-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah it's it preach that as as a political statement you know in front of congress saying we should fund it because we don't know what we're	going	to discover yeah that's kind of that's kind of hard to defend in some ways but	#telephone#	telephone_sw4246-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh those are the best kind so it's	going	to be a monster yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4247-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

so i mean but i mean people do need to realize that that there's not always	going	to be land but that's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4249-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah yeah that's	going	to change at some point you know  a couple of years ago nobody around here talked about it and then one day everybody just kind of woke up and said gee you know we're we're in trouble and we got to fix this problem um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4249-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and besides that i don't think i think the NRA's got such a big lobby that i don't think  they'd be able to yeah clearly they have some other motive you know i mean their their argument used to be you know the communist were	going	to take over or something well they aren't anymore you know so what's the argument now well yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4252-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah just so that they'll they can understand all the pain that they're	going	through and you know then they wouldn't be saying well that killer has a life too because it's not true the as soon as the killer kills someone they they should deserve to die their life is over too i mean they took someone else's life so i don't i just don't think they should deserve to live i think  everybody who's ever murdered	#telephone#	telephone_sw4253-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
what that means is that the politicians rather than try and clean up this that nest of uh problems they'll they'll come out to uh to uh people and they'll say what you you have to uh we're	going	to enact stricter laws on the rest of you yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4253-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah yeah but myself well like for example with this you know the democratic race we got	going	here the different candidates we got all this other stuff all i'm seeing are a couple of yahoos and uh no issues so to speak	#telephone#	telephone_sw4259-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah that's true and there's there's not really that much of what's	going	on and the only stories that really get talked about are the ones that have good video clips to go with them um-hum yeah and it's been a long time since i've seen any  you know source of the media do anything gutsy	#telephone#	telephone_sw4259-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and that's i guess uh something that distresses me when they have to cater to all these different special interest groups we're not	going	to get the news well that's one nice nice thing about the public radio and public television is for the most part they're some what distanced from that but	#telephone#	telephone_sw4259-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

i think that's that's reasonable those of us on this side of uh the justice system have to pay pay our way through life yeah and and the costs are real high i guess of both uh of of keeping someone in prison and	going	through the trial procedure the whole whole works uh yeah absolutely	#telephone#	telephone_sw4261-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah that's true so to me i i i'm i'm	going	to back and say it's the students have got to be looking to learn uh they've got to be curious	#telephone#	telephone_sw4262-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum so you know it it it goes to show it it does prove that even even you know gun gun control certainly has a place but it's not	going	to be the the cure all of all society's ills sure sure but i guess uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4267-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

waffling i don't know i i uh i don't really like the idea but then occasionally i hear about a heinous crime where i think well if we're	going	to have public capital punishment then you know this guy should definitely get it one thing that bugs me about it is the uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4272-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

uh for an indefinite period of time you know mental hospitals and so forth rehabilitation and that's	going	to cost us a lot of money and i don't really think that we should be doing something like that	#telephone#	telephone_sw4272-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah now i think that's more related to other stresses outside you know if you get into a period where you're very very stressed on your job or very very stressed in your life then you're	going	to be you know if you have the predisposition then you can turn and your habit goes up and that's very true of alcoholism uh well yes and also the others too i mean i'm	#telephone#	telephone_sw4274-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and probably some cheaper labor and things where we could benefit by purchasing booster rockets or maybe something on  that we can probably get from them cheaper than we can produce ourselves right how do you feel as far as spending uh the tremendous amounts of money that need to be spent to keep the program	going	how do you feel about well i don't know i think it's kind of hard to determine	#telephone#	telephone_sw4276-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh is that right so they're	going	to continue but i've also read a lot of bad things about it how they're talking about the value of the space station is very limited in the amount of information that can be gathered is is minimal but	#telephone#	telephone_sw4276-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum but the uh the the center that we went to had we've felt like uh had too many children for each counselor and so you know any any child that had any kind of problem or was just upset wasn't	going	to receive the kind of attention that we wanted our child to have um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4280-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yes that that that stuff should be kept confidential far as that goes yeah and it's it but yet if that's that's in any kind of a computer database  somebody's	going	to get access to it that and uh real easy to abuse so it's accessible that's right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4282-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you know i think that uh we've gotten ourself into a lot of trouble um i think that well i think that getting ourselves out of it is	going	to be painful um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4283-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yep i guess if i was	going	to advise a parent on um well you know maybe how to help their their child choose a college the first thing i'd be interested in is what's the child interested in doing i mean do they have a a a major that they'd want to be interested in you know courses that they'd want to be taking um	#telephone#	telephone_sw4291-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

there there there needs to be lots of evidence for appealing um i have a friend who uh took his trial by judge and that's the worst mistake anyone can ever make because at least with the jury even though you're	going	to be tried by six or twelve people who weren't able to get out of jury duty that's an old joke but it's still true a lot of the people who you would want to have on your jury don't want to have anything to do with it	#telephone#	telephone_sw4294-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but still i take my chance with the odds of twelve and we have to sacrifice letting a few people get away with things because eventually they're	going	to be caught then for my personal risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time	#telephone#	telephone_sw4294-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
not at this point in the business cycle you can't yeah i think that the people that um orchestrated this and engineered our having the deficit should have appreciated you know what it was ultimately	going	to cost it was a very bad decision to start letting that grow yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4295-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum um-hum and the eighty six tax reform well just made it more complicated even though it started as a simplification bill if i were Ronald Reagan i would've said unless that reduces the size of the IRS code by thirty percent i'm	going	to veto it well as much as that's a bad thing i think that uh there's some other really major major things that need straightened out and you'd mentioned waste a little while ago	#telephone#	telephone_sw4295-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and uh i've seen with my own eyes a tremendous amount of government waste i was in the marine corps and we had uh several hundred thousand dollars worth of transformers sitting on the wall that had been contracted out to be built as replacement parts for an old Westinghouse Radar Westinghouse wasn't	going	to support it anymore and Spencer you know Spencer Gifts that company said they'd go ahead and build these things and they didn't build them to specifications so they were unusable they were too physically large to go back in and we spent um four thousand dollars apiece on those things and there they just sat there taking up valuable space in	#telephone#	telephone_sw4295-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh no and they're writing all their software to overlay programs into this sixteen bit address space rather than	going	to something that was you know modern fifteen years ago i don't know how much it costs them to maintain that outdated software but you'd think at some stage they'd get the get the idea that it it it pays to get to be more current	#telephone#	telephone_sw4295-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
exactly and i and as far as hunting i'm sure you know this is the same thing and if if you are a a you know a legitimate hunter or you just need a handgun or something like that a two week or three week wait period is not	going	to make any difference yeah i mean most	#telephone#	telephone_sw4296-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

how do you keep up on current events oh well i'm pretty much of a space cadet a zombie i really don't know much what's	going	on uh i guess most mostly of what i get is from the news from the excuse me from the newspaper i don't have a television so that doesn't help	#telephone#	telephone_sw4297-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum right yeah it's interesting now there all	going	to uh CD's now also um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4299-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum so now they're wondering how they're	going	to do that with CD's  it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4299-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um it's very much like a a a an extemporaneous or a uh uh you know just a a jam session Jazz because you know there may be a basic pattern you know if you're playing a reel or a jig you know that's the basic melody of the jig but people are just	going	off and doing their own things and these are people who may have never played uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4300-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yes but you know someone will just come in and you know who's	going	to who's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4300-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i think some of them are dishonest and some of them are probably honest mistakes it's hard to me to imagine that somebody's	going	to overwrite uh what what was the largest amount of checks and write out a check for five thousand dollars and not know they're overdrawing their account yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4301-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh kind of your personal life right yeah that that that's how i feel i feel the um the employee um the employer has concern about you know what's	going	on in my body to the degree that it affects how i am doing my job and uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4302-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh that's you know that's one step and it what it is what they're getting into is the drug testing is a real quick and easy way and politically um feasible way of	going	about this because you know everybody is	#telephone#	telephone_sw4302-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
wow you know and so it's obviously that there's not you could've decided okay i'm	going	to stop now and may have stopped for three months and still it would show up in these tests and that's completely unfair yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4302-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right you know there there there's so many things i mean if if i were	going	through a divorce for instance which is something a lot of people experience that would really negatively affect my performance yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4302-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah you know are they	going	to require that i stay married or that i require me to some how have a perfect marriage or something well then you know that doesn't make sense uh-huh yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4302-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and we all know how efficient the government is uh the way i look at it is if uh if all the internal bickering between in Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health health uh over who's	going	to get credit for solving it were to be set aside um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh but like so many other things i think the way just the way that we're	going	about it is not the best way well um i i think	#telephone#	telephone_sw4303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
kind of what kind of overused in a sense it's the idea is that you can have a two income family and nothing is	going	to be changed you know the idea of quality time over over quantity of time spent with kids which i think is nonsense	#telephone#	telephone_sw4304-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh the it's up to you you have the choice and so the the company does shut down between Christmas and New Year's i don't believe that this is a long term solution that they're	going	to use but uh they have been doing it for the past couple of years and they may do it for a year or two more development yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4305-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
sure but uh you know i've watched this slowly erode erode erode until the point where now um i figure that the next thing is	going	to be uh you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw4305-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and further more if we think that you are uh we're	going	to make sure that you can't get a job or that you'll be fired from your job if you are engaging in this behavior now blood tests aren't really being called for what they're doing is calling for piss tests which technically it's leaving your body but whatever it is they shouldn't even have the right to ask	#telephone#	telephone_sw4307-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well i think first thing is they need to talk with their child to  their child talk to their child and find exactly what they want to do why are they're	going	why are they	#telephone#	telephone_sw4309-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh and um beyond that i think you need to consider the uh range of expenses of	going	to college that would probably narrow your ranges down even further um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4309-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and uh she is is	going	through the process much like what you're you know you've described and i've described described so how far away do they want to go what do they want to do how important is whether it's a private or a public school	#telephone#	telephone_sw4309-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um apparently they have plenty of time the boards right now for computer systems and other tracking methods to get rid of the fraud and everyone says well it's	going	to cost a billion dollars to implement this well a billion stacked against a hundred and eighty billion sounds like a good investment to me but are we what do you think are we talking about	#telephone#	telephone_sw4310-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh sure uh and and find out what's	going	on you know statistical cross-referencing and and uh you know the the pork barrel and all that other stuff that they uh you know um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4310-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
exactly and uh if they can't even balance their own check book how in the worlds are they	going	to balance a trillion plus dollar budget well then you have you have President Bush	#telephone#	telephone_sw4310-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and uh if they can't even balance their own check book how in the worlds are they	going	to balance a trillion plus dollar budget well then you have you have President Bush	#telephone#	telephone_sw4310-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that that's another way is that the consumers just don't trust big business they just don't there's so right there you have an element of of the political government you have an element of big business and you have the consumer watching and they're just	going	what's this um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4310-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
the in the our capitalistic society it's just those controls it's just it's the business it starts	going	and if they can its its the dollar that that dictates and if they can find someplace to dump something or their pollution and we're polluting something unfortunately well	#telephone#	telephone_sw4310-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and um  it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose  the child care facilities well i guess if i were	going	to choose i mean my first consideration would be safety right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4311-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i guess and that  that's about all he had	going	for him or still has for that matter that that and a marvelous hairdo	#telephone#	telephone_sw4312-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well i guess uh start off by saying that i am very much in favor of space travel but i think we're	going	about it all wrong okay with that	#telephone#	telephone_sw4313-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah well i am uh kind of disappointed by the way things have been	going	uh basically we've been out this at this for what about thirty five years	#telephone#	telephone_sw4313-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i think it's important that it happened i think that ultimately it will happen um i think that the way things are	going	on now may be an impediment and that by that i mean you know i don't know about i'm not	#telephone#	telephone_sw4313-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum but it's	going	to be a real long term uh play or whether you're just	#telephone#	telephone_sw4313-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but it's	going	to be a real long term uh play or whether you're just	#telephone#	telephone_sw4313-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
or whether you're just	going	to sit back and watch television and um when you look when you see that your primary competitor is um a government with very deep pockets that's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4313-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so i think the government getting involved in that tends to reduce the amount of uh private uh effort put into it uh with regard to myself personally i think that if ever if i ever in my lifetime do stand on the surface of the moon it's	going	to be uh on a ship with a Japanese flag i would say that i have absolutely no	#telephone#	telephone_sw4313-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

you know and i guess in states where they don't have capital punishment that's the kind of stuff they do but i think in his case they will put him to death because all the all the kids you know all the families and stuff aren't	going	to tolerate it yeah but i thought he he received his sentence um	#telephone#	telephone_sw4315-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
remember maybe what the what the final turnout was what is the final uh is he still	going	to trial for that i thought he went to rehabilitation rehabilitation mean they they were	#telephone#	telephone_sw4315-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

but the the but the uh prosecution was trying to uh say that he was sane when he committed them so they could but they they were	going	for the death penalty i think that's what they were trying to uh i mean the they knew he did it that he was guilty it was just a matter of was he	#telephone#	telephone_sw4315-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah i'm well think of it yeah yeah i i but i wonder about that the the mere fact that it isn't cost effective do you think that that if if it's not cost effective do you think that people are	going	to be enthused about it oh well certainly the people that do volunteer to do all sorts of things aren't thinking cost effective	#telephone#	telephone_sw4322-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well i think everything that people you know what do people do they polish their cars right why do they do it because they think they're	going	to be saving lots of money on repainting and having the car last that much longer no because they want it to look really sharp hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4322-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
not you know not to forget the cost of putting all of those kids in uh in in in non market uh enterprises enterprises for for for a couple of years uh that's	going	to delay their entry into the work force delay the time when they can begin paying taxes too so so the impact is	#telephone#	telephone_sw4322-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh really huh yeah he had he had given me the information and i said hm that's interesting so i thought i'd uh get involved and see what's	going	on with it yeah kind of curious because um some people found about it on the computer network others yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4324-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

that it's easy to do that on Monday nights or is it um-hum it because it turns out that Monday night of all of the other nights of the week generally is the one that has the least number of other outside influences	going	on so we find that it works out quite well and	#telephone#	telephone_sw4440-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh i actually live in Florida so uh uh i'll be	going	back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4443-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right the the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of playing golf i was	going	to say i mean it's a great game but i mean to play a really nice course you've got to have a really big wallet  i mean	#telephone#	telephone_sw4443-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

was that you have uh like i say you have the people say well it's	going	to uh it's gonna reduce taxes and the other people say yeah it'll reduce taxes but at the expense of something else and so it was how shall i say it it was kind of focused pros and the cons and then the rebuttal and so i got to see both sides whereas in the current booklet it just says here's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4467-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah so i'm listening to that i kind of got an idea that i thought would be good was and this kind of fits into the uh the aid program the welfare program that's	going	on right now uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4483-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

you know i've had some friends of mine that have made the trip down through there a couple of times they really enjoy it but there's something about	going	down in a hole that  just um doesn't really relate that strongly to me i suppose i'll try it someday but i always like to climb mountains and get up where i can see something yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4495-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and uh she had no wish or desire to go into that kind of facility and uh we were very concerned about uh her long-term care my great-grandfather after he was found out he was	going	to go into a nursing home uh actually gave up the ghost more or less hm	#telephone#	telephone_sw4497-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but i'll read anything and uh try and and pick it apart so uh let's see what was the other thing i was	going	to say uh now my earlier statement about if if they caused crime then Virginia should have a lot of them	#telephone#	telephone_sw4501-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh he was uh he was a real psycho though and uh as a matter of fact it this happened under Cuomo's watch so the Bush administration was thinking if Cuomo is	going	to run for President they were gonna do instead of yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4502-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
it's so i you know i don't where it's	going	to go to in the end i just think that um i i i agree with you i'm not really that terribly against it as long as it looks like it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4502-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so i you know i don't where it's	going	to go to in the end i just think that um i i i agree with you i'm not really that terribly against it as long as it looks like it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4502-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh down here it's not all peaceful either though i don't if you've been following any of this stuff course we had the big snafu right now with the the Mets thing but there have been a lot of uh a lot of things	going	on down here all the Gainesville murders yeah yeah i we heard that yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4502-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah yeah i we heard that yeah course i don't think they've they that then actually down here there's been more more publicity	going	on on police police screw ups and and uh beatings and everything than than actual murders and uh the Gainesville with the Gainesville picking up people seemingly	#telephone#	telephone_sw4502-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right i don't i don't have any experience myself with private schools so i really can't say they're better i did go to public schools and what i'm finding um right now i have two kids and i'm	going	back to work and i'm substitute teaching in public schools um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4503-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right right i know i but i i think the the public school it's not that the teachers are inferior or that the materials are inferior i think what's	going	on is that the teachers have to be backed up when the kids don't do what they're supposed to do um the teachers have to have some way to	#telephone#	telephone_sw4503-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i yeah i definitely agree with you there i mean it's people i mean that that don't care much about uh uh like federal things or you know things you know uh like the deficit people who don't who don't really care about stuff like that really don't have any clues to what's	going	on like right under right in their own towns or counties or state or whatever so yeah i agree with you yeah i think people are even you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw4512-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you know not in in touch at all well i i think in your case college students in general pretend not to pay that much attention to the local politics i think they've got enough	going	on yeah yeah that's that's that's true yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4512-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so how do you and when once you get ten children though you may have no i think it's just	going	to be one oh all right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4519-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh yeah that's that  doesn't seem right does it yeah oh yeah that's really i'll say you know this really makes me feel good about what's	going	but uh yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4522-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right it's uh it's you you it's the same it's the same premise as day care for a child yeah you know it really is you know that brings up a good point i've got a friend of mine up here and we were talking about this because his father is getting to the age where they're	going	to have to decide what to do and uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4522-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
our schools are reflecting the same kind of mismanagement that uh lead to the demise of the Soviet Union and that is when you've got an absolute monopoly and uh you can't uh you know it's a one party system so to speak then what you're	going	to have is gross inefficiencies and nobody cares and reality uh uh is just not a market base system and i know i've been in the Orient for about three years and	#telephone#	telephone_sw4526-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum and if somebody decides that they're	going	to if their decisions are out of step with reality uh pretty soon people don't stop	#telephone#	telephone_sw4526-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah and i you know i'm a i the only that i hate is uh well along with that training is i when kids have accidents with guns i there's a lot of stuff coming out now that they're	going	to start holding the parents responsible for not making the gun safe and i think there's a lot to that because kids are just naturally curious and then and you know when they're five and six years old accidents will happen that's why you know they need to be locked up the ammunition kept separate and all kinds of stuff	#telephone#	telephone_sw4540-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum yeah i was just	going	to ask what you thought about the  NRA uh you know they're i think they're like any lobbyist you've got extremists on both ends you know and they're saying that there's nothing wrong with these assault rifles and this that and the other you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw4540-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and and handguns are just fine and i just think you know there's some middle ground there to where that they maybe go overboard and do too much they i guess they do have a lot of lobbying power power and you know their big thing is well if you you stop banning one type then it's	going	to lead to the next and so on and right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4540-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah raped and then killed a seven year old girl you know that's fourteen years old what's he	going	to be doing when he turns into an adult uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4548-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well i figured i'm available now and actually i've had this thing on speaker phone and it's it tried about fifteen time oh yeah yeah i've got i've initiated a few at the office like that and it takes a while during the day uh well it's an interesting topic wanna get	going	okay i	#telephone#	telephone_sw4555-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and i don't really mean that it well i've heard that it only gets worse my husband and i sit around thinking gosh you know what are we	going	to do when she starts	#telephone#	telephone_sw4570-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well i've heard that it only gets worse my husband and i sit around thinking gosh you know what are we	going	to do when she starts	#telephone#	telephone_sw4570-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah and you know we plan also plan a family activity because people are coming and	going	and it's hard to be all together to do something so uh-huh what kind of things do you do on the family activities	#telephone#	telephone_sw4570-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right um figures well since we're not really accomplishing much of anything internationally let's make big headlines by	going	out and being for mandatory drug testing and within the community	#telephone#	telephone_sw4576-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that's than uh anything else it's interesting that you find out with all these little scandals	going	on now such as in the house with the post office cocaine scandal right yep	#telephone#	telephone_sw4576-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh we didn't have to uh  we didn't have to ignore a lot of uh Bush's success because you know he really did a lot in the last term he uh with with the Gulf War and all we could have we could have had our judgement clouded just by his his accomplishments you know i i really do think i am	going	to vote for him again next term but um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4588-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
no i really don't they need to do more with uh you know the police forces they need to make sure you have more people out on the street i think you know to try to keep track of what's	going	on and be harder on criminals when they go to court you know make sure they go to jail and they serve all their term it seems	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you start way back when yeah generally you know a kid'll do something that's outrageous and they'll say well what are you	going	to do to me and it's almost like the criminal system there's not much i can do to them i can't really do anything to them one fellow said i said how about you do your work and he said well how about i throw these scissors at you	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right and and i think that's the the biggest thing that unless people know that you're serious and you're not gonna tolerate that kind of behavior in anybody i this is just gonna keep	going	um-hum well i think that's like the problem with you know drunk drivers that people don't they're not cracking down they let them back out on the street they don't really take away their license they don't really make sure they can't drive anymore	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you know and then they bring up the thing about um whether we should have death penalties uh i guess you know the the top of the the bad guy ladder maybe you know some of those people would be affected but there's lots of crime	going	on besides murder where right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
okay well um i've never i've didn't really ever have to have a budget um until i quit	going	to Georgia Tech and um then i learned to budget really fast  um i had been working part-time before that and uh my parents were helping me some but um	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i had been working part-time before that and uh my parents were helping me some but um i got to where i mean i knew where every penny was	going	but then as i started making more money um my budget's kind of hasn't doesn't exist except for at certain times  you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i still haven't managed to uh uh do it the way i should yeah but even even if you do break your budget i think when you write things down or however if if you do it on the computer whatever or something where you can just constantly see exactly what where your money's	going	right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but but even if you can't i don't think have enough a really when before when i had a strict budget it's because i had too i knew exactly where every penny was	going	before i had it but it's it's a little bit harder when you have a little bit more leeway	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right but you'll find that the  kids don't really have a very good sense of where the money is	going	and so they'll ask for things pretty much constantly right i remember doing that as a child	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but uh i don't know whether i believe that they should just randomly do it i think they should kind of warn them like you know well we're	going	to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired you know that this is what's gonna happen	#telephone#	telephone_sw4605-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i think so i think they all should test really you know uh it just seems like there is so much more of it	going	on anymore yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4605-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that's amazing slip in slip out you know they know exactly what they're	going	for so i've heard that's really on the rise as far as um you know a new type of crime yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4608-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah and i think the same thing is true with news if you want to just have an idea as to what's	going	on most papers and and especially the better papers the the Times the Wall Street Journal the Washington Post give you a reasonable idea uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4611-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and i sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine and when i arrived at her house she was engrossed in that we ended up watching it for a couple of hours zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and eating watching it some more and i thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was	going	on but even then i didn't end up doing it on my own um	#telephone#	telephone_sw4611-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right of course motivation is everything and i suppose you're striving for intimacy on a intellectual level it's really hard to figure out how you're	going	to do that but of course we're trying to talk about dress and not teaching well i i think i'm talking about dressing how it conveys a uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4612-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and the old uh if you can't see it then you can't spend it uh idea exactly exactly and if you can't touch it you can't spend it either so that kind of works out where you get into uh some plans that you know you touch it you're	going	to get a penalty that kind of thing so it leads you to kind of say well i'm not	#telephone#	telephone_sw4615-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
exactly exactly and if you can't touch it you can't spend it either so that kind of works out where you get into uh some plans that you know you touch it you're	going	to get a penalty that kind of thing so it leads you to kind of say well i'm not	#telephone#	telephone_sw4615-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
it leads you to kind of say well i'm not	going	to take it out i'm	#telephone#	telephone_sw4615-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right that's kind of how we do it but ours is more like month to month too uh short term is to get things	going	so any way other than that uh is kind of how we do it so i don't know if we're our time is up or what  they'll let us know	#telephone#	telephone_sw4615-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
do they have a death penalty in California yes in fact they're	going	to execute somebody at the end of this month and uh yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4617-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum there's a big uproar	going	on right now uh the uh Governor you know has been trying to decide whether he's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4617-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

uh experience and then having talked to several other people that that uh unless you're in a an environment where they're	going	to make fun of of of better clothes that better clothes always pay off right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4622-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
really oh maybe they're	going	to arrest us both i'm even even in worse shape because i have eight children	#telephone#	telephone_sw4626-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound you buy a a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars to me i realize if you have eight kids you're not	going	to run out and do that not very often	#telephone#	telephone_sw4626-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
not very often but but i'm just i'm just saying as a single person that's that's a drop in the bucket and so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up if you're buying mean if you're not	going	to super expensive restaurants which i don't care to go to that's right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4626-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
the uh better chance you have at at curing it and that's just not true no i don't think so i  i i totally agree it's just like education throwing more money into a grade school isn't necessarily	going	to make things better right i think uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4629-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you know that the that a majority of the hospitals resources should not go for for uh indigent  AIDS patients that's right well certainly if you have AIDS unless you're incredibly wealthy you're	going	to end up indigent right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4629-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and and competing and of course the competing itself really didn't matter what it was it was making the friends and	going	all the places and it was a really neat experience but it took our total time i did not work um when i did this now i do work full time	#telephone#	telephone_sw4633-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
either make a special tax for it or implement the money toward that away from other areas it's	going	to be such an amazing insurmountable insurmountable you can't even imagine the cost it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4637-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
it's	going	to be such an amazing insurmountable insurmountable you can't even imagine the cost it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4637-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and and if they can find a resource of course they can cut the pain and suffering but if anything the cost they're	going	to save a well fortune just implementing that money toward that do you think it's more important than cancer or something else simply because the the numbers are so large	#telephone#	telephone_sw4637-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i'm not i don't really know what we are spending actually uh that's exactly what i was	going	to say i don't really know how much we're spending it may be one of those things that takes twenty years to find anyway or fifty well well i hate to think there's a you know it seems that anytime a bureaucracy works on something they waste a lot of money on administration costs	#telephone#	telephone_sw4637-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right or bucks make right so uh in certainly you're not	going	to have the same kind of honesty on the other hand uh i i i think it seems to me that all the big scandals are based on either	#telephone#	telephone_sw4640-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i i i think it seems to me that all the big scandals are based on either individual honesty uh	going	corrupt or frankly uh uh elective honesty	#telephone#	telephone_sw4640-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
individual honesty uh	going	corrupt or frankly uh uh elective honesty	#telephone#	telephone_sw4640-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and also so they could find someplace they enjoyed while they still had choices to make so they wouldn't be stuck	going	into just whatever nursing home was available at the time i guess that's a problem too for people wait lists right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

to me i would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here and not so much emphasis put on what's	going	out in space and what it you know not that i want everything to halt and let's forget about the space program or whatever because we're always curious and we always need to know more things but um	#telephone#	telephone_sw4822-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

it's really putting some constraints on your whole uh the whole lifestyle which is it seems to me it seems to me like um like everyone is lamenting you know the loss of the nuclear family and saying that it's	going	to be the downfall of America but to me um um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4837-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

as it as it turns out you know it's one of those one of those interests that you know i kind of like to keep up on because well it's nice to know that when i'm actually you know i do start working that i'll like to know like where my tax dollars are	going	too  i work hard to to get you know i like to know where it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4840-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
to say well geez um you know last year was a bad year and we've only got you know we only took in two hundred million dollars uh i realize that i'm off by a factor of about five but  we only took in two hundred million even though this year is	going	better we can still only spend two hundred million i i just keep seeing unfortunately the problem a lot of the problem why we have this deficits balloon especially during the eighties is just because the American people	#telephone#	telephone_sw4843-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
the deficit doesn't seem to affect me in my daily life and routine so so what it's	going	to affect your kids yeah i know but you notice these people are only now starting to think ahead	#telephone#	telephone_sw4843-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum and i don't know whether it's	going	to have uh the affect that of course all the the career politicos here say oh my God you know you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw4843-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

my husband's a big news fan and he'll always have the news on but sometimes i'll get involved doing some other things and um newspapers maybe on the weekend but during the week i just really don't have the time in the morning to get it uh and i'll listen to  news on the radio but just in the car radio	going	to and from work in between music uh see  here we're in in mountain standard time and uh well the few times when i've run into shows like Good Morning America uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4846-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
the more i can see each decision that was made as being understandable but the cumulative effect was to really get into a a hopeless situation where and as you say uh	going	halfway was probably worse than um committing um committing to a completely and um winning it whatever that would mean yeah well i i i think we did i think we did learn some lessons that we weren't uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4858-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah  the  monkey i think yeah there was some kind of research	going	on and i can't remember what the exact uh gist of it was but something they hadn't considered before and it's like they now they're trying to go way back to the original	#telephone#	telephone_sw4861-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

single mothers who are trying to raise kids and you know are off working all day and the kids are on their own you know that much guidance they're	going	to get into trouble and you know now good stable family structure uh keep them straight or you know father figure to look up to or anything	#telephone#	telephone_sw4869-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
within uh Russia or any of the republics and then we do have a real clear foreign policy and a a problem and a threat because of the number of nuclear weapons that are there we seem to have lost the ability to control what's	going	on in the country right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4874-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and i suspect they will form some sort of economic union when all is said and done  i don't think i don't think yeah yeah yeah we're we're still	going	through a a uh you know a settling period you know they're not sure who they want their leaders to be they're not sure how they want the you know uh relationships between the states to to shape so i agree with you know they're they need another couple years to to let them uh settle down	#telephone#	telephone_sw4874-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i hear there's some uh smaller amount	going	on in Atlanta too oh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4875-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
the rioting and all that kind of thing uh-huh and last night it was	going	into some of the nicer areas too you know uh rather than just staying in the in the uh in the sections that it started in	#telephone#	telephone_sw4879-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and so but we just really you really had a we had a tough time uh relating to what you actually what was actually	going	on as to what was being reported um i i think uh the news is starting to think of itself as theater	#telephone#	telephone_sw4879-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but like you said we were not shown that we were not uh unless we you know read in-depth you you get that you don't get that impression and so that makes everybody up in arms i've been very annoyed lately by the sensationalism that's	going	on i was uh visiting some friends over the Easter vacation in California in uh California near San Francisco	#telephone#	telephone_sw4879-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i was uh visiting some friends over the Easter vacation in California in uh California near San Francisco and the big thing out there was they were finally after twenty five years	going	to execute someone um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4879-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right oh they do that on VCR and it's high pressure i mean it's like well you know you must be stupid if you're not	going	to buy this  why right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4883-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah you got something	going	all the time	#telephone#	telephone_sw4886-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on uh you know on accumulated  body of law and if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start	going	back and digging up all these cases that uh that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards so i i really don't think it they they can really do much of anything to change it what do you think	#telephone#	telephone_sw4890-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um i have a very good idea of what our expenses are and how much we can afford to spend and can't spend and you know so it it's not like we just totally don't have a clue as to what's	going	on but i wish we were a little more organized a little more you know when i think about it there are certain parameters we work about	#telephone#	telephone_sw4891-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that's right that's right you know you never know if if you own a home you never know if something's	going	to break and you're gonna need more that's right well it's very difficult my husband is in is self-employed he's in uh financial planning and and so all of his income is commissions	#telephone#	telephone_sw4891-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that's right well it's very difficult my husband is in is self-employed he's in uh financial planning and and so all of his income is commissions it's very hard to sit down and budget because you don't know what he's	going	to make uh you know we kind of think you know he usually brings home at least this much and i can base you know base it from there right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4891-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh i guess it's not totally not understandable  you know i'm i'm sure that if you're looking at whether or not you're	going	to get elected and have enough money to run that they've got to uh got to take that into consideration oh sure but i think it goes i you know a little of it obviously is they're getting themselves prepared for when they're out of office when they become consultants or high-powered lobbyists themselves	#telephone#	telephone_sw4895-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
it's uh well it it's it's such a complicated thing let me just relate to you uh an experience that i had with politics at a lower level uh and i think what it boils down to is that if you can't find compromise you're not	going	to be successful um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4895-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so i guess if we were to go about making the change you would have to really demonstrate to people that there is some legitimate reason to make the change that would directly benefit them otherwise we're never	going	to really see any change yeah well	#telephone#	telephone_sw4899-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i'm just	going	to walk over here and stop my cats from doing what they're doing um and the metric system is you know hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4899-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah that's true who i don't think are	going	to especially you know they may do it in the more in the big city centers or in certain round uh manufacturing industries but the average person in Raleigh Missouri i don't think is	#telephone#	telephone_sw4899-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
who i don't think are	going	to especially you know they may do it in the more in the big city centers or in certain round uh manufacturing industries but the average person in Raleigh Missouri i don't think is	#telephone#	telephone_sw4899-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i don't know it just seems to me that everybody wants to know if they do something what's	going	to happen to them um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4901-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum i substitute teach and i have kids who talk fresh don't do homework and they say so what's	going	to happen to me and and people getting less and less respect and they understand they know that the bottom line is not very much is	#telephone#	telephone_sw4901-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i substitute teach and i have kids who talk fresh don't do homework and they say so what's	going	to happen to me and and people getting less and less respect and they understand they know that the bottom line is not very much is	#telephone#	telephone_sw4901-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
are always willing to um let in cheap labor  if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area those are two  things that i think are	going	on although they i i i don't think the politicians would tell you that okay and i think you're right in both cases	#telephone#	telephone_sw4902-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum and uh i think it's too early to say you know whether they're	going	to develop some stable societies there in one form or another um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4903-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
or whether this uh  old uh Russian tendency to turn their fate over to some insane ruler is	going	to surface again sure yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4903-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um it's	going	to take both democracy and economic progress and uh resolution of their nationalist institutes i guess right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4903-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right all of that is	going	to have to happen and if any one of them turn sour they could still be uh dangerous simply because they might not you know they just might sort of lose track of what they're doing	#telephone#	telephone_sw4903-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
it looks like um we're	going	to have um a um sort of a third party movement on our hands in the fall	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i  that's a pretty good point i hadn't thought about it like that but yeah it's i guess it's not really um a start up with uh necessarily new ideas and you know this is my positive outlook but rather uh saying well uh i'm just not very happy with uh with the other two parties seem to be	going	type of thing yeah i think there's absolutely no political philosophy the only thing that uh Perot um seems to has to offer is that uh he's a doer	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah and since most people agree on what needs to be done but nobody can figure out how to do it he's just	going	to say uh i'm a CEO i know how to tell people to do things and get them done	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um in each party and not really coming up with a new ideas or the or maybe i mean it it you know it's time for maybe a definite new vision and and what's	going	on which may be you know a blend of both you know maybe both parties or you know a little bit of this a little bit of that which may not fall into the lines of either party but you know just doesn't seem as though either party wants to do very much that rocks the boat or maybe maybe says oh its time for a little bit of you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah things aren't	going	very well oh in the big picture maybe right now Congress getting better or it's maybe it's getting worse or who knows but you know it's just like a little ripple in the ocean it's  know some some somebody got to look down the road a ways and say well what's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i i think it has to be up front and then you've got the choice of not doing it yeah well well the problem there is that you know a lot of people that have worked for the same company for so long um that company decides well if we're	going	to hire new people you know well we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw4911-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah well well the problem there is that you know a lot of people that have worked for the same company for so long um that company decides well if we're	going	to hire new people you know well we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw4911-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um and uh then they have the choice of either take the test or don't get the or or don't take the job and if they know they're	going	to fail the test you know they're kind of in a in a between a rock and a hard place there so it's uh kind of like	#telephone#	telephone_sw4911-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you know a little crazy but he wouldn't you know give a urine sample and it was pretty obvious why you know he's just like oh i can't do it i can't do it you know  and this went on for hours i was wondering why he didn't just leave you know if you're not	going	to do it just leave he was gonna fail	#telephone#	telephone_sw4911-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yep yep and then here's what we have now i mean what's in five years from now it's just unimaginable what we're	going	to be able to do with these things yeah yeah well you know if we ever get any sort of uh ISDN running nationally it'll be really incredible	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah uh so you know it's	going	to kind of impact everybody everywhere well i see the phone companies are working on getting into information services so we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum oh yeah and i think that the technology's catching up to the point where we're	going	to be able to do things and make it a lot easier to for people to understand how to do these things um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so i'm hoping that we will see another type of revolution but one that will be a little more friendly to the end user yeah yeah um i think what's	going	to happen is it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum but i think everyone's working now i i mean i'm seeing this we're	going	to see a lot more in the way of keyboards with electronic program guides and and everything else and ordering systems they have this thing called TV um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

hm um a mass turnout of the current people that we have in there or whether this is just	going	to be another of the same old well throw the bums out but not my bum you know right right as long as he brings pork back  my state then um what what do you think his	#telephone#	telephone_sw4926-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right right as long as he brings pork back  my state then um what what do you think his chances are what do you think uh how much of the vote do you think he's	going	to get and do you think he will take it more from the Republicans or the Democrats well the media media keeps saying that he's supposed to drain it away from the Democrats but i know that there's a lot of Democrats that don't like Bill Clinton	#telephone#	telephone_sw4926-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i you know i'm concerned more concerned about Democrats saying they're unhappy with Bill Clinton and then they go and vote for Ross Perot and then we basically split any protest vote against against Bush more or less in half you know i mean you're dividing it too far and then he squeaks by for four more years and you know for me that's not a	going	to be a wonderful uh feeling exactly	#telephone#	telephone_sw4926-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

So we uh, through tremendous diversionary tactics of dragging my leg and my elbow and so forth we managed to stop just at the, the edge of the road after blistering my elbow on a big knot of ice but uh, I don't think Marsha knew about that until a few years ago I guess I don't know it's been a while but uh, yeah the snow there in the winters were exciting to say the least. [SEP] I remember many mornings	walking	down to the bus where you know whatever you had in your nose would freeze. [SEP] It would just crunch and you went to blow your nose nothing liquid came out it was crystals and you'd get on the school bus and it would be so damn cold that the floor of the bus would just be a solid sheet of ice you'd have rock salt scattered on the floor of the bus in order to keep some kind of traction and uh, had a couple of deviant children there on the bus and one's name was Robbie Share.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And on this particular night, it was night, they, they had a bull out there that was pretty mean and would charge the fence at people. [SEP] And um, Grandma, my grandmother, their mother, was	walking	with them that night. [SEP] She was going to watch TV.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BranchElbert.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And uh, it was dark, they really couldn't see. [SEP] And uh, they were	walking	up the path and Grandma accidentally stepped in something that was really soft and her foot got to sinking and instead of her pulling that one foot back out and shaking it off to keep going, she stuck both feet in there and she started to holler.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BranchElbert.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
mom would always sit us around at home at the evenings, um, and tell us about her days growing up.

We call this our home because this is where we were raised at.

I didn't know how to go around and try and find. [SEP] So I just pulled the van over and at the plant parking lot and I got out and started	walking	and I was just, I can remember live wires being everywhere, crackling and popping. [SEP] And the first thing I saw when I got home, was my neighbor over here, two houses over.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He was outside, he was, it was really funny. [SEP] He was out and here I come	walking	up and looking like something the cat drug in. [SEP] And he's like, "Debbie, Have you seen my shutters?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
You know? [SEP] It's like a loaf of bread that you can chew on while you're	walking	down the street. [SEP] Yeah.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
But it's just wonderful! [SEP] There's, there's so many things that you never get the chance to see anywhere else, but you can see it all just	walking	around. [SEP] And then, of course, you have Lombard St, the crookedest street in the world.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Absolutely the crookedest street in the world, yeah. [SEP] And all those are right there within	walking	distance. [SEP] Then you take a cable car and go to Chinatown.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Uh-huh. [SEP] And still that's not that far, but after	walking	up and down those hills! [SEP] You are ready for bed when you go to bed that night!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And uh, you know, I mean we were trying to be quiet not to wake her parents up so you know and uh, we ended up watching this movie and this movie ends up lasting until about um, 4:30, 5:00 in the morning. [SEP] And uh, she's, her dad works uh, construction so uh, she told us we had to leave because her dad gets up real early in the morning so uh, we hurry up and get out of the house and uh, we're	walking	on the way home and uh, we're seeing the uh, newspaper car running around throwing newspapers out. [SEP] And uh, I don't know who thought of it I don't know if it was me or	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And uh, one of us thought of the idea of sticking a newspaper in the mailbox and setting the mailbox and newspaper on fire. [SEP] So uh, one of us we were	walking	down the road picked up uh, a newspaper wadded it up and stuck it in the mailbox and uh, this was uh, metal mailbox with uh, brick around it. [SEP] And we stuck it in there and we lit it and it shot into a big old flame, you know lit up the whole sky.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And we stuck it in there and we lit it and it shot into a big old flame, you know lit up the whole sky. [SEP] And I mean we were just, you know it got us real fired up you know and so uh, we were	walking	along a little further and we saw another newspaper and uh, we stuck it in the mailbox and it was another metal mailbox. [SEP] So uh, we were like "Cool!"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And, and, she said, uh my Granny said she got up and she, she looked up and she said, "You know, wonder who that could be?" [SEP] And so she sat back down, and, you know, they were still chatting, and they could still see this person, and this person was	walking	really, really fast. [SEP] And she said that her brother had this really distinctive walk and she said the more she looked at that person coming down that road she started thinking "No, that can't be, that can't be."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but she said, "It can't be." [SEP] So Granny got up, and she kind of walked down the steps off the porch and she was	walking	up towards the road and she then just stood there. [SEP] And then he was coming, she said he was coming really fast--she said could still remember all that dust kicking up on the road--and here he's coming down the road, and she turns around and she said, "It's Joe!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I don't know if you remembered it or not or ever thought about it. [SEP] Well, we got the pictures of that and, and even got the pictures of a Russian officer	walking	on the gangplank. [SEP] Why this was the next day.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I say, "OK, everybody, we're going to get out of the truck, we're going to kind of look around, we'll do some stuff, and then, we'll probably eat breakfast, and then we'll go or, ea, we had our little bag lunches, and then we'll go down to the lake. And, uh, we get out of the truck, and we walk about ten feet, and I, I was like,	walking	over logs and trying to get over to a fairly clear area, and all of a sudden, Alex just goes, "Snake! [SEP] Snake!"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And I, I'm like, God, somebody's trying to tell me something. [SEP] So anyway, we kind of, we stayed away from the snake and we're kind of	walking	around, and then, Jack and Nick, they, Jack's the oldest, and Nick, you know, is eight, and, uh, they want to go down to the lake, and Elizabeth's going, "No, don't let them go down to the lake, just, it's too steep, don't let them go down to the lake." [SEP] And, uh,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
You guys can go, go down to the lake, just be careful. [SEP] " And, uh, so they kind of walked over to the hill, kind of started	walking	down, and at a point they just had to sit on their butts and kind of slide down, and the trees were all cut, so they'd grab trees as they were going down. [SEP] And, um, I was just watching them, and I was up at the top, and then, I started down, I'd figured, let them go first, then I'd, I'd go kind of behind them.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It was totally safe; you never locked your doors. [SEP] We cut through the woods	walking	to school. [SEP] Um, and then when I got in junior high, we started riding city buses to school.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It made a huge impression on me and was a big thing. [SEP] Columbus, GA is the home of Fort Benning, GA, where the largest infantry school in the world at that time was there, and as a kid	walking	to school, and believe it or not, I did walk four or five miles to school and I would go up Brown Avenue, which was at that time the only road that would allow the convoys to come through. [SEP] And I would walk along the road to school and convoys of young men would, uh, ride by in the backs of trucks and I would wave at them and it was not a sexual thing in those days.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

Her name was Crystal. [SEP] And so, um, we met in FL, and in Boca Raton and we stayed with my grandparents, and we would stay with my grandparents for at least one night, uh Boca Raton, and then the rest of the week we spent in Fort Lauderdale because my grandfather owned a hotel called The Sanddollar in a place called Lauderdale by the Sea, um, in Fort Lauderdale, and it was fantastic time and when we had the chance to spend time together and just go out on the beach and at night we would go out to dinner I remember going to a Benihana Japanese steakhouse, and we just felt like we had freedom, and then we weren't yet 21 so we weren't allowed to go to clubs in Fort Lauderdale, so we basically spent our time, uh, watching movies in the hotel room or just	walking	along the strip and I remember going out for ice cream one night and just	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

The BHB is the Butt Hole Bandit and you know what I'm saying, it all started from the time where, you know what I'm saying. [SEP] And we'd be	walking	home from school and we'd see some man. [SEP] I, I guess, you know what I'm saying, somebody wore a black hat just looked creepy that you'd never seen before.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So we were just like, "There goes the man with black hat." [SEP] Then come to find out that during that same summer, this guy that played on our football team had, supposedly was	walking	through the park, Briarwood Park on, um, Plaza. [SEP] The same, uh, elementary school that we went to.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
The same, uh, elementary school that we went to. [SEP] He was	walking	home from the basketball court and he supposedly got raped by this dude.

And I remember one time, we were picking on this dude who wanted to fight, you know what I'm saying, we thought we were the stuff `cause nobody could catch us on our bikes. [SEP] This dude was	walking	through our neighborhood and we started calling him the Butt Hole Bandit and whatnot and he started chasing us and he was saying he was the Butt Hole Bandit- -but he probably just saying it,-	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It's been a good couple of years for us Yankee fans here lately. [SEP] And, uh, we were down on Fifty-Third Street, which is five blocks away from Central Park, and, um, my fianc�e had just passed her boards and it was our anniversary, so I decided to surprise her with	walking	down to Central Park off of Fifty-Eighth.

Well, to back up, when I was just learning to walk, your grandmother and grandfather told me that when we'd go down to the beach and spend the summer at the beach, back then there was no air conditioning whatsoever, and so all the, the bars and the stores and everything on the boardwalks would have screened-in, screened doors on the front. [SEP] And any place we'd go by when I was	walking	with them, I'd have my hands up in the air and they'd be holding either hand-- --and when we'd go by any place that had a juke box playing, I had to stop and jog up and down in time to the music.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and if i try to wait till the end of the day when i think i have a little bit more time i don't always have the energy level yeah that's hard isn't it  uh that that four to six o'clock i see a lot of people out	walking	and i just think oh i'm just going to go and you know just sit yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3958-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah that it is and it is hard to do i mean it is easier to do at home even the	walking	which i can do right here the idea of getting of getting in a car to drive to a a place which a number of my friends keep suggesting	#telephone#	telephone_sw3958-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah i know i've i've come to the conclusion also that you know just if you are	walking	in a downtown area you know where where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's gonna just just keeping your senses about you and you know trying not to look like a victim you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw4023-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
of doing that either no  no i i i i just get a sense of our	walking	in over and over and over again in places where we weren't well versed or something right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4030-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

That was the first time I saw them, the gue, the guerillas. [SEP] Then they	went	on, they didn't make it to the house. [SEP] At about, about three weeks later, then arrived a group of about four, at my brother's house, and told him, that they were coming to, to be, that is to take control of the place, where we lived.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
But if we didn't want to work with them, we shouldn't get them into anything with the mil, military, such as, informing on them, or something like that. [SEP] So, time	went	on. [SEP] Then when, well, since I lived alone, only with my son, they, would seek me out because, I always had, everything, because I had all kinds of animals, including doves from Castile, uh, turkeys, ducks, hens, pigs, cows, all kinds of animals.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
And that's how, I kept on, working and, with them. [SEP] They there, well, they'd come from time to time to buy things, until one day, well, they already had been there for several years, when, all of a sudden along came a young fellow who	went	around with them whose name was Jose, they call him "Chepon" because he was tall, white, and all.

I said, "No, I'm not going to tell them." [SEP] So, the next day, I left early in the morning for San Miguel, to see my daughter, and when I was coming back, I	went	by my brother's, which was a place in, a town called Chapeltique, and I arrived at his place, and I said, his name is Salomon, and I said, "Brother, I am here to see if you'll give me posada (lodging)," we call it, like you give someone a place to live in your own house. [SEP] And he said, "What's going on?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
"Yes," I says. [SEP] That same while that I was there at my brother's, we	went	to look for, the people who owned land, to see if they would give me, pasture land for the animals. [SEP] And, yes, they gave me some, and I left.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
And, yes, they gave me some, and I left. [SEP] It was getting, I got there late, like at, six in the afternoon, I got home, and after I waited for it to get dark, I	went	to my neighbor's. [SEP] My neighbor had about four, five grown boys.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
So he said, "OK, that's fine." [SEP] And, the same way I	went	out to another, er, e, cousin, his name is Cristobal, and I said, "Cristobal, do you have to, what are you doing tomorrow?" "Nothing," he said, "Why?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
And that's the way it as, how I kept working there. [SEP] After I worked there, then, that, I	went	to, San Miguel, because my daughter, also, had, she needed me. [SEP] And, I kept on, and finally when I saw that life was really expensive, and I didn't have, I couldn't work anymore since I'm not a professional, then I decided to come (to the US), because also, well, the, there in that area, since now there wasn't anywhere to work, I had left hidden from the guerrillas, and, well, that's what I continued.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

So, they tool him away, we didn't see him anymore, they took him to San Miguel, I don't know, if in that vehicle, surely in the same car they were riding in, they took him to the hospital. [SEP] Then, we were left, and since they were still in front of the house, we	went	to a woman's home, who was a nurse, so when a big round of gunfire started, we covered ourselves up against the walls of the houses, we walked a little way, we threw ourselves against the other wall, until we could get there.

[SEP] You're not eating your lunch," come with him, so I	went	, he, I had to follow him and remember being really nervous and he sat me down a corner and he told me I had to sit there until I ate all my lunch, and I remember, um, crying for a long time and I think that basically what happened there was that was just an amazing mood swing because I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
Um, um another memory with my family that I have is that we had a lot of weddings, ah, and these weddings were always really big weddings, and I've always been told the reason why they're so big is because basically it's Polish, you know. [SEP] Half of my family's Polish, so Polish, we have big weddings and I remember at my cousin's wedding I was like 12 years old going to it and I had a my cousin Tim and he was about 10, and, ah we	went	to this wedding and it has like 200 people. [SEP] My uncle, he's a great guy.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
My uncle, he's a great guy. [SEP] He's also really big into the Hell's Angels and he brought about 50 of his friends to it and the wedding took place in a hotel one of those classic areas where you have, you have the weddings, and it was, ah, basically a really stormy night, real stormy and the power	went	out, and it was open bar so now we've got, ah, 50 Hell's Angels, no power, and it's the middle a summer, so it is getting really hot in there, you know, there's, there's no lights so you know there's a few emergency power lights that people brought, ah, and they had some sort of battery they were using for the ah for the radio system and it was, it was getting really crazy in there because we had Hell's Angels running around without shirts on, uh, people highly intoxicated, I remember by 10 year old cousin saying, "Bottom's up, Thomas! Bottoms up!"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
I was like, "OK, well that's good," you know, like that. [SEP] Well anyway, I	went	back to my, my desk.

And you know, they were a close family and they loved each other and all that kind of stuff, but it was just down the road, you know, so they said fine, and, and you, you know, he came back on Sundays and he was with the family at church and all that sort of thing. [SEP] Um, but, ah, one day he didn't show up, on Sunday, uh, for church and so they wondered what was going on and they	went	to this house, ah, down the road and the cousins had packed up and left. [SEP] They had just gone.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
Of course they already had done the pilot's bit before they done, well, I had to go through altitude chambers myself because I was working with pressure suits. [SEP] I	went	to Fort Worth, TX to go through the altitude chambers with a partial pressure just like I was working with, and when, when all the training was done on the pressure suits and things, I was chosen with a sergeant secretary to go through a school, which, we was in a school about the size of a nice-size bathroom. [SEP] We would go in there.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
We would go in there. [SEP] The doors were locked when we	went	in.

So I would go back determined, determined to stay with it, and, of course, they trained two more after I had been through, but who did they use to set all the injections?

OK, well, that's where I	went	. [SEP] They chose me over everybody else, and, of course Sergeant Secretary, he was a different AFC, but he's the one that	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
Uh, of course, I won't go but we, I have just so much I could talk about, but, uh, that is the main things that we, of course, everybody knows now that the, what has happened. [SEP] Uh, Russia backed down and that's the good thing to do because if they did not and we	went	to nuclear war, I was trying to get my family out of Del Rio and back to NC, but it happened so fast I didn't get them back. [SEP] Because if their was a nuclear war then, or if there's nuclear bombs started missiles or anything, I would want the first one to hit me right between the running lights because this just would be a world after a nuclear war and--.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

I, I would say, your Mom and I were in our late thirties and you were um, um well anyway, it doesn't matter.

And we had a great time.

So we threw open the back of the Vega and took all our camping stuff, everything. [SEP] We didn't even pack it we just wadded it, just mushed it all up running around this incredible torrential rain, shoved it into the back of the car and, uh,	went	home one night early.

And I remember thinking, "I can't do this." [SEP] And on and on we	went	and all I remember is it was getting closer and I really couldn't figure out a way.

She was kind of confused of what background she wanted to u-, what ethnic background she wanted to use, so she decided to use her black heritage, um background. [SEP] And so she moved to New York and she	went	to school there, she made it through school and she did become a attorney. [SEP] She later was going through problems because they found out that she was a black ethnic and not white, so they would, she could no longer work with the firm.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HicksDebra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
She started the organization and I can't remember the name of the organization and, um, she helped out a lot of, of women that uh, that were black women that were having problems being able to make it in society because of their, their color or their culture background. [SEP] And, um, let's see she didn't she, her grandmother passed away and she, um, after her grandmother passed away, she moved from GA, her and her husband, she did have a child and, um, so she moved back to New York, and she, uh, after she finished helping with this, um, women organization, um, she	went	back into law practice.

So it's, um, almost like you'll, you'll meet, ah, if you go to Guelph you'll meet someone will probably know a Jamieson there. [SEP] Yeah, yeah because some of, like my aunt who just died was a bookkeeper who worked at a lot of local businesses and was extremely gregarious, so I think she was probably on a first name basis with a awful lot of the people who shopped downtown or whoever	went	downtown she was she lived there all her life and just knew a lot of people and they sort of come out of that kind of, that Irish tradition like everybody's your friend, everybody's your neighbor and even people that, ah should be fairly casually, she'd greet those people by name and know a little bit about them, ah, and so yeah she's, ah, and my cousin, one of my cousins, has a couple of businesses in town and I think is relatively well-known is on some sort of city board, or something like that. [SEP] Yeah the family is big enough and the city is small enough I think that you would run into a decent number of people who would know a Jamieson or two.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

It wasn't that late, it was only about nine o'clock, so we decided to get some flashlights and go for a walk on the beach. [SEP] We	went	out on the beach and started to hunt for little sand crabs. [SEP] They are so much fun to try and catch.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
We got about ten sand crabs in a bucket and then decided to let them all go. [SEP] They all	went	crazy. [SEP] The beach was beautiful, the stars were out.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
. They finally got themselves out of their deep holes and they	went	in the ocean and took some rafts and tried to ride the waves. By then it was time for lunch.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
And to chill off in the shade since to was getting kind of hot. [SEP] So we sat around and ate hotdogs and milkshakes and then	went	back out in the sand for a while longer, I took a nap, and my husband and the boys played Frisbee. [SEP] It was the Fourth of July; so we decided that we should get off the beach for a while and let the kids take a rest.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
They were everywhere. [SEP] We	went	down to a dock and someone was letting them off on a dock. [SEP] They were all so pretty, it was so much fun.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
Well, it was getting late so I think it is time to go home. [SEP] So, we	went	back to the room and we all fell asleep.

We're running 70 as we come past probably the, probably at Harris Blvd. [SEP] And so I	went	ahead and let my units know up ahead as soon as we got into Matthews, he's getting blue lighted. [SEP] And I felt that he was impaired to go ahead and start another unit then.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
And so as I'm backing off, I'm, I'm still keeping an eye on him if he's slowing down a little bit and he goes to highway, to Matthews-Mint Hill and 74 makes a left hand turn. [SEP] And so I	went	ahead and, uh, got back in the chase again because I figured, um, you know, I just figured I'd go ahead, go ahead and chase him because I knew that he couldn't keep up that kind of speed on the, uh, on the Matthews-Mint Hill. [SEP] And Rich was in behind me by then and so we head on the way down Matthews-Mint Hill, we probably running around 80 or 90 miles an hour.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
And so he, both pulls in, they both pull in, you know, and I let them know that I lost him and then a Highway Patrolman comes up and, uh, asks, "Which way did he go?" and I say, "He	went	down that way." [SEP] And so he heads out that way spinning tires trying, trying to catch up to the guy.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
It was an afternoon in January, and there was no school that day, and my mom told me that my grandfather, who lived in RI, had died, and I guess at the time I wasn't able to deal with my emotions or that I was in denial that it happened and I remember just running away to my best friend Bonnie's house and not even telling my mom or my dad where I was going, and I got to her house and I told my friend what had happened and she could tell that I was really upset about it, and so I just felt I'd just run away. [SEP] We	went	on our bicycles and we told pretty much the whole way, and I guess that her mom Dottie had called my mom and told her that I was OK because I'm sure that she was worried. [SEP] You know, I all of a sudden ran out of the house with no explanation, but it was very comforting to spend that time with my friend, and I didn't want to be alone and it was a really good experience.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
You know, I all of a sudden ran out of the house with no explanation, but it was very comforting to spend that time with my friend, and I didn't want to be alone and it was a really good experience.

[SEP] And so I would go over there and we would watch TV on Saturday mornings, and usually I would spend the night, and, um, so we'd watch TV during the day and then we would go shopping at the mall and her mom always gave us 20 dollars to spend on anything we wanted so that was always fun and I remember we would during the day watch music videos and just hang out and have fun, and she had an older sister named Tina, and it was in high school, and we were in grade school at the time, and we would always try on her clothes and because she was really stylish and had the Guess?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

One time we lived down in Brooklyn and Miss Sara and she taking care and she did laundry for these millionaires out there on, uh, I can't call the place now, but anyway and she'd come then she'd get Aunt Winnie and several people to help her, you know, do the washing and ironing. [SEP] And one day then, I, I think we didn't have to go to school or something, but I	went	down and, Miss Wheeler was her name, she said, "Don't you want to iron a shirt?"

The reason I said Louisiana is because that's where I lived all of my life. [SEP] Everyone	went	to Vicksburg, Mississippi to have their babies at the Mercy Hospital because we had no facilities in Lake Providence, the most beautiful place on Earth, surrounded by um, lakes, Cyprus trees, good people, right on the banks of the Mississippi.

Miami, Florida was almost too much for six people in a car to be together for a 10-day period. [SEP] But coming home we stopped in New Orleans and my dad had been on a roller coaster in San Francisco and he thought it was such fun and so we	went	to Pontchartrain Beach in New Orleans and that was nearing the end of the vacation and he said he wanted my brother Fred and me to go for the experience, he thought it was going to be so much fun.

I would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it, was a really big thing to go to the movie on Saturday mornings. [SEP] And one particular movie theater we	went	to, they would show serials every Saturday, which were a continued story. [SEP] So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you, um, wouldn't know what had taken place.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
And there was one other sucker that cost a nickel and we called that an all day sucker, just because you couldn't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long. [SEP] And one other form of refreshment that we got, which really embarrassed my mother because she didn't know anything about this until she	went	with us to the movie one Saturday, there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre. [SEP] And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go. [SEP] And we	went	to Open Kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we didn't have money to leave tips. [SEP] We would also drink water.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
Anyway, that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre, and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it's kind of a, pretty much of a spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time. [SEP] So we bought our tickets and we	went	into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat, file, all filed in. [SEP] And I just remember seeing, and I was sitting in a middle section, I was not on an end so I had girls I knew on both sides of me.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

But when I was seven, we moved to Pensacola, FL, and um, we, there were four children, and we were enrolled in a Catholic school, because my parents were Catholics, and um, they wanted us to go to the Catholic schools in the South. [SEP] So, I	went	to, I was in the second grade, and I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_O_ConnorChris.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
So um, my mother learned of Ira Lee from her very close friend, my girl friend's mother. [SEP] Um and we all	went	to the same school together and the same church together. [SEP] And so that's how we found out about Ira Lee.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_O_ConnorChris.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
She was like our guest, she just ate dinner with us. [SEP] But I'll never forget when we	went	to have a lunch at my girl friend, Patricia's house, where Ira Lee also worked.

Then come to find out that during that same summer, this guy that played on our football team had, supposedly was walking through the park, Briarwood Park on, um, Plaza. [SEP] The same, uh, elementary school that we	went	to. [SEP] He was walking home from the basketball court and he supposedly got raped by this dude.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
He was walking home from the basketball court and he supposedly got raped by this dude. [SEP] And, you know what I'm saying, it was real gross because they	went	into details about him having to have stitches and all this stuff by this dude raping him. [SEP] He was supposedly this old man in a black hat and he walked around from neighborhood to neighborhood trying to follow kids.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
I mean that and I mean it probably, probably didn't even happen at all. [SEP] It's like one of them little urban legends of, of a man who	went	somewhere and did something bad and just really messed up the minds of all these kids but probably helped us; you know what I'm saying. [SEP] We didn't need to be out at night anyway.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
And they were already jealous, a black man making money, or a half back man making money, or whatever you want to call it, and they came and burnt the house down, burnt the chicken coop down, and they killed a cow, or a couple of cows, I ain't too sure about that, but I think they killed a cow or a couple of cows. [SEP] And, um, they tried to take his land from him and they took it from him for a minute, and he	went	to jail for a little bit, and he got out, and still, you know, couldn't get his land, but he bought, bought, and bought, and he got his land back. [SEP] And, um, now, you know, every family reunion is held there and, and, um, the land is divided up, you know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

And she said, "I understand. I understand," and I	went	on further to say, you know, just, just, I gave several reasons that she, she agreed with. [SEP] And I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

It caught her a little bit off guard and she said, "Yes." [SEP] And we	went	and saw one of the poorest movies I've ever seen in my life, Three Men and a Little Lady. [SEP] It's the sequel to Three Men and a Baby.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
Uh-huh. [SEP] Anyway, we	went	and saw that movie; both of us hated, hated it and I think we may have actually hold, held hands together in the last half of the movie. [SEP] Didn't kiss.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
Didn't kiss. [SEP] Then we	went	to Baskin-Robbins and she got some Chocolate Gold Caramel Ribbon ice cream and I got Mint Chocolate Chip, and we ate and we made a mess and I drove her home. [SEP] And that was our first date and how we met.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

And I asked her if she wanted to wear it since I couldn't, because it would, you know, the hand had the cast on it.

[SEP] And um, we left Connecticut and we were driving down, we were driving in my sister Diane's um, Ford Escort, which she'd had for about a year and a half and uh, we were driving and everything, anticipating good weather and I think we were just about right outside of Savannah, GA and I was driving the car and her car is standard and um, the clutch	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
So, I couldn't go out, I think I was like 19 years old and you have to be like 21, uh, 18 in some clubs and 21 to drink, and we decided not to go out, considering everything that had happened that day. [SEP] So, we woke up the next morning, we	went	down and we drove down to FL. [SEP] I think it took us in all about 23 hours, maybe 24, because she, Cape Coral is on the West Coast.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
After we yelled at her for about three hours she decided to slap some sunburn on the back of her, suntan lotion on the back of her leg, and it left a nice white print, like hand print on the back of her leg, and the rest of her got sun burnt. [SEP] So, then we basically um, we visited with our grandmother and I have some step family that lives down there, so one night we	went	out with our cousin Teddy and we uh,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

[SEP] And he	went	up to grab it and he burned his fingers and so we told him, you know, times that we burned ourselves and that it hurts and that it will stop. [SEP] And plus, you know, Rob can talk away fire so we had to call Daddy and tell him to talk away Rob, Gage's fire.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

Mama cut my head off with the butcher knife. [SEP] " Now that knife, when I	went	to sleep it really scared me.

So she said, "Go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we, you know, can follow through with applying for a grant, scholarship grant for you." [SEP] So that night I	went	home and I asked my mother about it and she said, "Baby, I really want you to go to college.

If I could just work, even as a teacher assistant I would be happy.

Out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity, so I felt very proud of myself.

After all of this was, after I, I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of going back to school.

Um, the, you know, I really don't know. [SEP] Um, that, I really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because I was there I think the first year I	went	there was the year they built a really nice gym, and I don't think they used that gym no more than three years.

As we walked up the stairs, the window was broken and the shade was flapping in the breeze, and the wallpaper was wet from the rain, and the elements had been coming in for years; as we walked through the home, and I have fond memories of that day, I was probably in the fifth or sixth grade, I would imagine.

[SEP] Uh,	went	around with, not so much a chip on my shoulder, just, uh, an inferiority complex and didn't realize until I got older that I was very much proud to be Japanese. [SEP] And uh, got to visit Japan a couple of times, and realized that's the best thing God could have given me was to be different because I'm able to help other people go through the same situation.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

Oh yeah! [SEP] My sister when she was like four, she	went	into the walk-in closet in my parent's bedroom and she put baby powder all over herself and all over the clothes.

If it doesn't happen I'll, I'll, you know, it can happen at another time I'm sure. [SEP] We'll be in the same place another time," because minutes	went	by and nothing happened.

I can remember uh, some of those stories now, uh, my mother would tell the story of a my uh, great grandmother, my grandmother sitting in the door of living room, when uh, my daddy would go to see her, before they got married and, and of course she would sit there until they leave, and sometimes she would act as though she was sleeping and got rather quiet, she would ( ).

Uh, and to a study uh, an experience related event. [SEP] So it boiled down and I ended up working on uh the national design of uh, experiences that would help students from small areas make the transition from rural to uh, to larger cities, in eastern NC and of course I based that on the basis of high percentage of individuals who left the area after college and	went	to larger cities many of them succeeded more than we would like to.

But, the high road leading to success and opportunities and even then, though we were quite young, he challenged us it seemed to get through that if we selected the high road that benefits had the possibilities of being numerous and sometimes when I'm out alone, when test and trials come, those words come to me, a group of words were uttered by ( ) that we were expected to learn and we were expected and required in high school to learn poems, to read poems and try to interpret poems that we could think of, and one of them was by Kipling, which was "If" and I don't recall all of it now, but it	went	on to say that "if you can dream and not make your dreams your master, if you can think and not make your thoughts your aim, you can meet with triumph and disaster. Treat those two imposters just the same" and it goes on the say that if you can do all these things, yours is the world and all that is in it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived

So, you couldn't cross the street, you couldn't turn in or turn out or anything, it was just really, really crazy, because they were doing such incredible construction out there. [SEP] And I remember all the headlights on all the cars were painted black for the first half, the first, the top semi-circle was black so that when if you	went	out at night, the light would shine just down on the road and not straight ahead. [SEP] Everybody had window shades, you didn't have blinds back then, but everybody had window shades that were blackout shades and you had to pull them down at night before you turned on any of the lights, because everyone was deathly afraid that the Germans or the Japanese were going to come bomb us.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3	went	came	drove	walked	arrived
