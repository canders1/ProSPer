Sequels: 45763<n>The bell rang and our snooty teacher walked in announcing himself. I spent most of the long class either glancing at the clock or glancing at Anna taking notes intently. I noted her eyes, her smile. I’ve never seen one like it. Finally the bell to rang.“So, my next class is,” I looked at my schedule “Algebra with Mrs. Coudrote.” “Ah, the Cood” She said with a sly tone. I figured it was a nickname for the teacher. “Down this hall. Follow me.” I followed. Her walk was hypnotizing. I had to catch myself from standing and staring. I caught up to her side. As we turned the corner, I tried to think of something to say to continue a conversation. “You do know your way around.” I said, regretting words the second they left my mouth. She laughed. “Yah, like I have been here awhile.” “I’ll bet,” I said. Anna began explaining the history of the school and soon I got lost within a few sentences but I didn’t care. I loved listen to her talk. Her voice was soft and quick. I knew I was stuck on her already.<n>Vocal Impulses<n>	#ficlets#	ficlets_1400.txt

I shake my head and go to the bathroom to start my hair, knowing once Amber picks an outfit she'll own the bathroom. I can do my make-up in my room, but all my hair stuff was in the bathroom.

I wasn't even sure where we were going.<n>I plug in my straightener and turn it on. While I wait for it to heat, I walk back to my room.

Standing in the center of the church, I took out my cell phone and called the police. “I need to file a missing persons report. …Rachel Frieze. Last night, walking on West 2nd street around – maybe eleven or twelve o’clock. What? …But, sir, this is an unusual situation. She didn’t come home last night, none of her friends have seen her. …Sir, if she’s in any danger, it will probably be too late to help her by that time. My girlfriend has disappeared, I don’t even know where to start looking, and I need help! …Yes, sir. I understand.” The police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight. I closed the phone.<n>Walking out of the church, a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise. A cold front must have hit while I was inside. Glancing down the street, I realized that I didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time, and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran.

In a thoughtless panic, Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre. His thoughts were not of the act's futility, nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing; instead, all that filled his mind was the tree's constant presence in his life, growing with him and beside him, its persistent reminders that he had higher, truer things to write, the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake. His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn, burning logs, but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes, tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers.<n>But he did not weep. Instead, he bethought himself of the loss of the tree; considered also Arthur's motivation and whether some good might not come of this, after all. Leaving the circle of ashes, he stood and turned towards the woods, in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood. He stepped slowly beneath the branches, a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great, swirling eddy, a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willow's last breath.<n>Allan wandered beneath the trees for a time, thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog, strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate. He considered Arthur's intervention; considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested, to write stories that others would read; for after all, what purpose writing if not to be read? And without that torturous willow, he might be free to write whatever he saw fit. Indeed, if he still could not, he could at any time follow Arthur's advice and seek a profession more grounded in reality. Perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind. He found himself along the bank of a low, wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current. As it turned to the deeper woods, elder giants rose above him: a beech, smooth bark a gray-green pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark, cracked trunks of the nearer trees; great pines, a few magnificent specimens still bearing the three-stroke symbol of the British King; a towering black birch, leaves impossibly high above him. As the stream wound its way through the largest pines, grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings, Allan continued, slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants. There was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal trespass.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_The_Black_Willow.txt

7 The future of boundaryless careers<n>When massive economic restructuring forced William H. Whyte Jr’s (1956) ‘organization man’ to walk permanently out of the front doors of the corporation, many of the assumptions of a traditional career path followed shortly behind. In the wake of his departure, people were left pondering how they would survive without a job for life, a corporate ‘road map’ to guide their destiny and the firm’s hierarchy to define their status or place in society. Without employers’ orderly structures, external guides for action, and linear career paths, however, just what is the future of career? When ‘the career’ devolves to the level of the individual does free agency prevail and a form of ‘career anarchy’ result? Is there anything that can be concluded about careers if everyone seems to be doing their own thing?<n>We argue here that the answer is an emphatic ‘yes’. The new environment suggests a shift from pre-ordained and linear development to perpetually changing career paths and possibilities. As a result a shift from ‘bounded’ careers – prescribed by relatively stable organisational and occupational structures – to ‘boundaryless’ careers – where uncertainty and flexibility are the order of the day – is increasingly common. The concept of the boundaryless career is broadly based, and intended to reflect the emergent pace of economic change. It does not characterise any single career form, but rather ‘a range of possible forms that defy traditional employment assumptions’ (Arthur & Rousseau, 1996, p. 6).<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_CUP2.txt
