Mass retailers displaced wholesale-jobbers as soon as they were able to exploit a market as large as that covered by the wholesalers. By building comparable purchasing organizations they could buy directly from manufacturers and develop a higher stock-turn than the jobbers. Their administrative networks were more effective because they were in direct contact with the customers and because they eliminated one major set of middlemen.6<n>Other factors drove the development of mass retail as well. The rapid growth of urban cities and access to their downtown areas, initially with horse-drawn streetcars, encouraged mass retailers. Department stores, with a wide range of goods arranged in “departments,” provided one-stop shopping, both novel and appealing to consumers of the period. The increase in women seeking ready-made clothing and home furnishings also contributed to the rise of the department store as did newspaper advertising. Although small specialty shops were limited to a few items, such as those found in a traditional dressmaker or milliner’s shop, department stores offered fixed prices and the convenience of returning purchases for exchange or cash. They sold goods at a lower markup than specialty stores and, above all, concentrated on achieving a high level of stock-turn (or the number of times products turn over in a given year).<n>Many of the first department stores have names that are still familiar: Macy’s in New York, Marshall Field’s in Chicago, John Wanamaker in Philadelphia. Chandler points out that the stores founded in the 1860s and 1870s accounted for almost half of the leading department stores in New York a century later. In addition, he writes, “Because sales were made on the store’s premises rather than through traveling salesmen, buyers had an even larger role than they did in the wholesale houses.... They had direct charge of the sales personnel who marketed their lines over the counter.”7<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
Two days a week, Kevin leaves his office 45 minutes early to take charge of his 2-year-old daughter, Sophie, while her mother, a university professor, teaches a late class. One balmy spring afternoon, Kevin retrieved Sophie at her child-care center and drove the 15-minute route home. Invited to look in on Sophie’s play, I met the pair at the front door and nestled into a rocking chair from which to observe unobtrusively.<n>After downing the last bite of her snack, Sophie grabbed Kevin’s hand and led him across the family room to a rug lined on two sides by shelves ﬁlled with books, stuffed animals, and other play props. Sophie moved a toy horse and cow inside a small, enclosed fence that she and Kevin had put together the day before. Then she turned the animals on their sides and moved them toward each other.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
This is the European conception of constitutional freedom. When the German Basic Law of 1949 declares human dignity to be the foundational value of the constitution, the implications run through all relationships that may come into being. This “third-party effect” means that private individuals are bound to respect the human dignity in each other, precisely as they are bound not to subject each other to relationships of involuntary servitude or, during Prohibition, not to sell each other alcoholic beverages. Today, men and women must avoid sexual harassment on the job, even though in this case the “third-party” effect arises not directly from the Constitution but from federal legislation.<n>An activist tripartite conception of government requires funding. Fighting a major military campaign to suppress the Southern insurrection required a stronger financial base than the government had needed up to that time. The war drove up spending from the customary 2 percent of the gross national product to 15 percent. (By comparison, in the early 1990s, government spending represented 20 percent of the GNP.)5 With no place left to turn, a Republican Congress approved the first income tax in 1862. By 1865, the income tax generated over 20 percent of federal revenue, the balance coming from tariffs and reintroduced excise taxes.<n>The Civil War income tax lapsed in 1872, and when the direct tax against income returned to the national agenda in the 1890s, the times were different. The disputes took on the tones of class struggle. This time, it was the Democrats who favored the tax as a measure of social justice. Many of the wealthy who were affected by the modest 2 percent tax denounced the measure as socialist. Almost immediately after the tax’s introduction, a challenge under the original Constitution made its way to the Supreme Court, where five of the nine justices were convinced that any form of income tax violated the prohibition against direct taxes not in proportion to the census.6 Progressive politics as well as the government’s demand for revenue generated a coalition that supported a constitutional amendment to reverse the decision of the Supreme Court. By 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment found the necessary three-fourths vote for ratification, and the income tax became a basic tool of modern state finance.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt
My sense of the literature of American history is that our scholars not only ignore the biblical influences on Lincoln’s thinking at Gettysburg but also fail to understand the significance of the “nation” that “our fathers brought forth on this continent.” The common mistake, particularly of lawyers, is to read the “nation” in this context as equivalent to the national government, as opposed to states, or to the national territory as opposed to local geographical units. In this limited sense, the “nation” is constituted by a federal government in Washington or by a physical space staked out on maps and recognized by other countries. The nation is then equivalent to the Union or the federal government. But the issue is not the authority of the “national” government in contrast to states’ rights. The derivative sense of nationhood as denoting “unified at a federal level” is surely present as a subsidiary meaning in Lincoln’s invocation of the term, but this could not possibly be all that he meant to say.<n>The American nation, as it existed in 1863, was a nation in the European sense. The assumption that drove the movements of national unification on the continent was that each nation should be able to govern itself. And self-government requires that each nation should be able to constitute itself as a state. If this was the thrust of mid-century European history, the same was to be expected of the immigrant nation of the United States.<n>. . . a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Thus ends the remarkable first sentence of the address. The nation of which we speak is immediately qualified. This is not simply a nation of common lineage—an extension of tribal identity. We are indeed different from the European nations, for our nation is born of an idea. It is conceived in liberty and dedicated to an aspiration of equality.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt
The Gettysburg Address was pregnant with the sentiment that the war expressed the fraternity of Americans. The bond was expressed not only toward the slaves who were liberated but also toward the two hundred thousand black men who fought side by side, though in separate battalions, with white men to liberate those still under domination.3 The national tie—the “bonds of affection”4 —is expressed as well toward the Confederate men in arms who, in Lincoln’s view, never ceased to be part of the American nation. This was a war between brothers. It was necessary to settle the inevitable family quarrel about the kind of nation the United States would become.<n>As American history took its course in the decades that followed the “war for the nation,” we managed to betray the inner meaning of the great sacrifice that Lincoln sought to consecrate at Gettysburg. We absorbed the war into the preexisting political and legal vocabulary. We could have celebrated a new vocabulary of politics—a vocabulary we shared with Europeans who were then moving toward nation-states of internal solidarity. And, yet, we ignored the appeal of the new for the sake of the old. We drove the solidarity of Gettysburg underground. We converted the ideas that should have become our new activist national charter into our passive Secret Constitution.<n>The issues that concerned postbellum America were not the ideas of solidarity and reconciliation that Lincoln managed to articulate both at Gettysburg and in his second inaugural address. With the assassination in April 1865 of the man who had preached a new order of ideas, the United States became a country obsessed with power. The great issues of the postbellum period breathed the tensions of institutional conflict.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
Equality<n>And equality—that glaring omission from our original Constitution? How did the Fourteenth Amendment’s attempt to rectify the sins of 1787 fare in the grip of the antebellum intuitions that drove the Miller court? The five majority justices could have applied the “equal protection” clause and achieved the same result that Justice Field had engineered under his construction of the dual tracks of citizenship: the butchers rendered dependent on the Crescent City Company were subject, they could easily have concluded, to impermissible discrimination. That would not have been a particularly radical result, and it would have established an enduring commitment to equality under the postbellum constitution. But no, the Court turned away from the larger issue of principle for the sake of overcoming a narrow historical injustice. The “evil to be remedied by this [equal protection] clause,” the Court writes, was “the existence of laws in the States where the newly emancipated Negroes resided, which discriminated with gross injustice and hardship against them as a class.”29 In other words, the only point of the new commitment to equality should be simply to eliminate the institution of slavery and its concomitant legal institutions. But if that was the only purpose of the Reconstruction Amendments, the Thirteenth had already done the job. There was no need for the Fourteenth Amendment and its commitment to the larger principle of equality among all “persons in the jurisdiction.”<n>Susan B. Anthony had already begun her campaign for women’s suffrage, but as of the date of the Slaughterhouse opinion there was little sympathy for moving the spectrum of equality up one notch to include women as a class worthy of protection. Immediately after resolving the Slaughterhouse dispute, the Court turned to the petition of Myra Bradwell to be admitted to practice law in Illinois.30 There was no dispute about whether she was qualified. She was a citizen of the United States and of Illinois, and she had the training and character to make a fine lawyer, but there was one problem: She was a woman. This was sufficient for the state to bar her admission, and the Supreme Court, with only one justice dissenting, thought this was an acceptable exercise of state power. After the Slaughterhouse decision, it was a minor stretch for Justice Miller to conclude that practicing law did not fall within the ambit of “privileges and immunities” of citizens. The amazing feature of the Court’s decision in this case is that it did not even occur to the judges to justify the discrimination against women as compatible with “equal protection of the laws.” The opinion is totally silent on the issue of equality. This was the temper of the times. In 1874, another woman, Virginia Minor, argued to the Supreme Court that Missouri’s denying her the right to vote violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court resolved the matter by unanimous vote.31 It did not even mention the possibility that the discrimination violated equal protection of the laws.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
No one chose to create an American nation consisting of North and South, white and black, native and immigrant, and there were undoubtedly many people displeased by the idea. Yet, this was the situation in which we found ourselves in 1863. Lincoln had conceived of rooting our history in the identity generated by the struggle for independence. History had forged a unique nation of people of diverse origins. Justice Harlan understood what the nation had become and what it could do to further its own internal harmony. His magisterial dissent leaves us with a historical record of what constitutional thought in the postbellum period could have been.<n>Instead of integrating our nationhood and the commitment to equality into constitutional discourse, the Civil Rights Cases completed the process of driving Lincoln’s vision into the deep structure of our constitutional thought. The Court generated a surface discourse to camouflage the Secret Constitution. It bequeathed to us a narrow conception of state action that we are still struggling to overcome. And, more to the point, by undermining federal authority to remove the incidents and marks of slavery, the Court facilitated segregation in American society. It would be a mere dozen or so years until the Supreme Court upheld the idea that public facilities, including schools, might be “separate but equal”—thus institutionalizing apartheid for generations.53 At the same time that the courts drove the postbellum legal order underground, concerted action by the children of slave owners organized to frustrate the purposes of the Fifteenth Amendment. Various measures, including poll taxes, literacy tests, and organized violence, were used to prevent African Americans from realizing their right to vote. The Democratic Party gained the loyalty of white Southern voters and remained in power for more than half a century, largely on the basis of segregationist principles.54<n>Yet, there is an important difference between the courts’ betraying the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments and the people’s frustrating the purposes of the Fifteenth Amendment. With regard to the first two of the Reconstruction Amendments, the courts gutted the great aspirations of the new constitutional order and led many professorial observers to teach that our Constitution really was what the segregationist courts said it was. This tendency to take the Courts at face value derived largely from academic skepticism about the possibility of a higher law prevailing over the uses of judicial power in our understanding of what the Constitution really required.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
You see the analogy to chemistry. The transformation of the lisp expression to a new lisp expression is rather like a chemical reaction. The operating lisp expression that does the transformation is rather like an enzyme catalyzing a reaction.<n>So Walter let loose a pot full of 10,000 lisp expressions in a computer. These merrily bumped into one another creating new lisp expressions. Walter, as a good theoretical chemist from the Eigen-Schuster tradition, imagined his algorithmic chemistry in a “chemostat” that would hold the total number of lisp expressions at a constant 10,000. So if extra lisp expressions drove the total above 10,000, Walter randomly chose enough lisp expressions to eliminate from the pot to keep the total at 10,000. This pruning back to a total of 10,000 provides a selection pressure for lisp expressions that are formed more often than average.<n>Walter let loose the floodgates of his alchemical world. A torrent of ever new lisp expressions, then, stunningly, a few, then more often, one sees an enlarging population of a subset of already-seen lisp expressions.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
We need a theory of the persistent coming into existence of new goods and services and extinction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera.<n>But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. With the horse went the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. With the car came paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. Most firms die young, some last a long time. We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions.<n>The parallels are at least tantalizing, and probably more than that. While the mechanisms of heritable variation dier and the selection criteria dier, organisms in the biosphere and firms and individuals in the econosphere are busy trying to make a living and explore new ways of making a living. In both cases, the puzzling conditions for the evolutionary cocreation and coassembly of increasing diversity are present. The biosphere and econosphere are persistently transforming, persistently inventing, persistently dying, persistently getting on with it, and, on average, persistently diversifying. And into a framework of such a diversifying set of goods and services we must graft the central insights of general competitive equilibrium as the approximate short-timescale mechanism that achieves a rough-and-ready approximate clearing of markets at each stage of the evolution of the economy.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
“The Tribune and Radiator Buildings are both in the ‘vertical’ style or what is called ‘Gothic’ simply because I happened to make them so,” Raymond Hood once flippantly explained. “If at the time of designing them I had been under the spell of Italian campaniles or Chinese pagodas, I suppose the resulting compositions would have been ‘horizontal.’ ”4 Hood was no more comfortable discussing style than other architects. He left unexplained the question of what had put him “under the spell” of Gothic in the first place. It had happened early: Hood’s senior thesis at M.I.T.—he later also studied at the Ecole—had been a church in the Gothic style; his first employer was the Gothicist Ralph Adams Cram; and Hood assisted Bertram Goodhue on West Point. Later in life, Hood occasionally returned to the Gothic style, notably in the handsome Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral in Scranton, Pennsylvania, but he never explained what broke the spell and led him to a more abstract style.<n>Like any successful architect, Hood had a strong sense of his changing time. It is easy to misunderstand the nature of that change. The abstraction that characterizes the Daily News Building and the RCA Building has little to do with new technology or changing functions. Those buildings are not any more “modern” than the Chicago Tribune tower, which had gargoyles and flying buttresses but was an advanced building in terms of planning and technology. Indeed, Hood’s Gothic design was more functionally advanced than Eliel Saarinen’s stylistically progressive second-place entry. It was not commodity and firmness that drove the changing aesthetic, but fashion. The public had a taste for simpler, forward-looking design, of which the International Style was but one expression. Art Deco, streamlined modern, and stripped Classicism were evidence of the same changing taste. Many industrial products of the 1930s displayed the same chic simplicity: Raymond Loewy’s curvilinear Coldspot refrigerator, Walter Dorwin Teague’s popular Kodak Brownie camera, Henry Dreyfuss’ Bell telephone, Loewy’s redesigned Coca-Cola bottle and the sleek Zippo cigarette lighter.<n>The medieval inventors of the Gothic style were likewise influenced by fashion. In the twelfth century, European cathedral builders abandoned the tried-and-true round arch in favor of the pointed arch. This change cannot be explained by functional or structural requirements, since the pointed arch provides only marginal structural advantages; and round-arch technology is perfectly capable of building tall naves, as Durham Cathedral and other magnificent Romanesque churches demonstrate. Cathedral builders obviously found something delightful in the pointed arch, which they used not only as a structural form, but in window tracery, in wood paneling, and even in choir-stall furniture and liturgical accessories. “[Gothic] was seized upon as essential not because it was materially essential, but because the pointed arch struck that note of fantasy which was what the mind of the age desired,” explains John Summerson. “It willfully destroyed the discipline of the round arch, which had become an incubus and a bore.”5 A note of fantasy? A bore? At this point, the eminent architectural historian sounds like a Harper’s Bazaar fashion critic.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch2.txt

Spanish internal affairs became the concern of other great powers after Charles II died in 1700 without heirs. The Archduke Charles of Austria rivalled France’s Philip of Bourbon, designated to ascend the throne, in the ensuing War of the Spanish Succession. On the Costa Blanca, Murcia was defended from the invasion of Archduke Charles by its bishop, with the help of local people; Játiva fought the succession of Philip so fiercely that when resistance was finally overcome in 1707, the town’s name was changed to San Felipe — the former name was not to be restored until the 19th century. Philip finally gained the Spanish throne under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.<n>Nearly a hundred years later, during the Napoleonic wars, Spanish ships fought alongside the French fleet against Lord Nelson at Cape Trafalgar, southeast of Cádiz.
