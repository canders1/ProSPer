the role of make-believe play in children’s lives<n>Among inﬂuential explanations of why preschoolers are so drawn to pretending, Freud’s psychoanalytic theory and Piaget’s cognitive theory held sway for much of the twentieth century. Although each has made valuable contributions to our understanding, a new, more powerful view of the meaning of young children’s play has arrived on the scene, thanks to Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory.<n>The Psychoanalytic View: Wish Fulfillment and Insight into Social Roles<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Furthermore, the language skills required to express different points of view, resolve disagreements, and persuade peers to collaborate so play can continue are complex and often subtle. Emily’s success in convincing several classmates to join the make-believe trip to Sea World was partly due to the way she approached them—by asking if they’d like to go. By experimenting with language during play, children can see how others react to various styles of communication and use that information to reﬁne their way of speaking. In this way, play is an ideal arena for mastering all aspects of conversational dialogue.<n>Opportunities to acquire literacy-relevant skills also abound in make-believe play. In one kindergarten, children transformed the block-building area into a make-believe recycling center with the help of their teacher. Signs were prepared that advertised the new center, its hours, and what it would pay for various goods. As in other friendly businesses, attendants wore nametags, such as “Hi, I’m Charles!” When customers arrived with goods, the attendants had to ﬁll out receipts listing each item, its quantity, and its value. Since many children could not yet spell, they used ﬁrst letters or drew pictures of items. While doing so, they often became curious about how to write the full word and asked the teacher to help them.<n>What does research say about the role of make-believe in children’s literacy development? The amount of time children devote to pretending at age 4 is positively related to reading and writing skills after entering kindergarten and ﬁrst grade—speciﬁcally, the extent to which children spontaneously read words on game cards and signs, understand print concepts, and write letters and simple words.29 The more children engage in literacy-relevant play (activities like the recycling center), the more advanced their literacy skills are as well.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
adult involvement in children’s make-believe<n>Piaget’s view of make-believe play, dominant until recently, asserts that pretending emerges spontaneously when children become capable of symbolic thought. He assumed that very young children could not share play symbols with others. Yet in instance after instance, we have seen that adults are central in preschoolers’ play lives, often encouraging and elaborating on their imaginative strivings. If adults are prominent in early make-believe, how did researchers manage to adhere to an image of young children as solitary fantasizers for so long? The reason is that until recently, make-believe was largely studied in the laboratory, in sessions in which children arrived one-at-a-time and had no alternative but to play by themselves.<n>Only during the past 10 years have researchers seriously addressed the social context of make-believe. Their ﬁndings conﬁrm that pretending, like other higher forms of thinking, ﬂows from social collaboration. More competent partners scaffold young children’s imaginative play, guiding its emergence and gradual reﬁnement. Once pretend capacities are in place, children forge playful understandings with peers that serve as microcosms of cooperative activity, mirroring social relations and goal-oriented pursuits within the larger society.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
A large portion of what is now Arizona was once considered part of New Mexican territory. As with Colorado, the folk customs, traditions, and language of Arizona have been closely related to those of New Mexico. The southernmost regions of Arizona, however, have always been more closely related to northern Mexico in customs, language, and folklore. After the U.S.-Mexican War of 1846–1848 and the signing of the Gadsden Treaty in 1854, Arizona experienced the same cultural changes as Texas, New Mexico, and California, although more gradually, since the region was not immediately overwhelmed by an Anglo American invasion as the other areas were. Arizona’s oldest and most important Mexican community has been Tucson, founded by Spanish settlers in 1775. Tucson was the frontier fortification of the Mexican state of Sonora until the Gadsden Purchase transferred it to the United States. It functioned as a cavalry outpost established in response to the many Indian raids of the times.<n>Mexicans were a majority through most of the nineteenth century, and Tucson had a bicultural spirit that was unique in the Southwest. A Mexican middle class ran some of the largest businesses, held political offices, became artists or intellectuals, funded private and public education, and created a prosperous Mexican society envied by other communities of the Southwest, with elegant theaters like the Teatro Carmen and Spanish-language newspapers. Tucson’s proximity to Mexico, especially Sonora, permitted Tucsonenses to remain close to their Mexican heritage. According to Thomas Sheridan, “This Mexican elite represented a local florescence of Latin American civilization in Arizona, its society and culture linking Tucson with the finest traditions of both Mexico and Spain” (3). Although there was a strong Mexican middle class, many Chicanos were working class, such as butchers, barbers, and later railroad workers. The railroad arrived in southern Arizona on March 20, 1880, and this changed society in Tucson forever.<n>There has always been a substantial Chicano and Mexican population in Tucson. The folklore of the region was recognized to be important, and Margarite Collier, an elementary school teacher, organized a Mexican Folklore Club at Carrillo School in Tucson in 1935. An article in the Arizona Daily Star of December 19, 1943, states that the club was “to help the children sustain pride and interest in the traditions, customs and folklore of Mexico and to perpetuate these customs among Spanish-speaking people of Tucson.” Miss Collier taught the children music, art, and folk dances of Mexico. Every year the school organized a Las Posadas procession through the streets of Tucson. The same article in the Arizona Daily Star describes this celebration, with the subtitle of the article stating, “Ancient Mexican Custom to be Encouraged in Ceremonial Here.” The children of Carrillo School carried out this tradition until the late 1970s, and the Mexican Folklore Club continued until well after Miss Collier retired from teaching. Miss Collier worked at collecting songs, games, and other folklore from the children of the school. The Margarite Collier Collection of her private papers is housed at the Southwest Folklore Archives of the University of Arizona library.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt
On the other hand, I am not persuaded that category theory will suce. In category theory it seems necessary to specify ahead of time all the possible domains and ranges and mappings under consideration. I will suggest in a later chapter when we consider the evolution of novelties that there is no finite prespecification for the work tasks, measurements, records, and catalytic tasks that might constitute autonomous agents. In short, I will argue that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere. Whether an incapacity to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere genuinely precludes the use of category theory to mathematize the concepts of autonomous agents and propagating organization is an open question.<n>We have arrived at this: An autonomous agent, or a collection of them in an environment, is a nonequilibrium system that propagates some new union of matter, energy, constraint construction, measurement, record, information, and work. It is a new organization of process and events. The collective behaviors of coevolving autonomous agents have, over the past four billion years, constructed a biosphere. If life is common, the elaboration of biospheres in the universe is rife. The propagating union of work cum record cum measurement cum constraint construction, the propagation of organization unfolding and diversifying, exhibits the very creativity of the universe. We are entitled to ask whether there may be general laws governing such nonequilibrium self-constructive processes in biospheres and the universe as a whole. I return to candidate general laws in chapters and .<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
Wittgenstein wrote persuasively that the same systematic diYculty was lodged in attempts to reduce one language game to another, for example, from a description of a legal event to a description in terms of mere human actions to a description in terms of physical events. As we noted earlier, legal descriptions involve a web of concepts concerning guilt, innocence, responsibility, evidence, admissible procedure that are absent from a description of human actions outside of the legal framework. And descriptions of human actions = and, a fortiori, descriptions of the doings of autonomous agents, even bacteria acting on their own behalf to get dinner = seem to involve a diVerent language game than mere descriptions in terms of physical events.<n>Among other critical features of the action-and-doing language game is that, compared to a hypothetical “complete” physical description, the action-and-doing description picks out the relevant features with respect to the goals of the autonomous agent. Interestingly, once we are at Dennett’s level of Popperian creatures, which can have internal models of, and plans for, the future and can have their models die in their stead, we seem to have arrived at a level of organization in which action-and-goal talk becomes essential. Is there a finitely prestatable set of statements about physical events that is jointly necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement, “The cheetah is hunting the gazelle”? Like other eVorts, we will find suYcient conditions but be hard pressed to find jointly necessary and suYcient conditions.<n>The dictionary hints at where our reductionism ideas may go wrong: Every word in the dictionary is defined in terms of other words. How could it be otherwise? Concepts are defined in webs, somehow tacked onto the real world by ostensive definitions = definitions given by pointing to examples. We carve up the world in a variety of ways, Wittgenstein’s language games, that appear not to be reducible to one another in the strict sense of necessary and suYcient conditions. And this, in turn, underlies the question whether legal systems and human actions are parts of the furniture of the universe, somehow above or in addition to the locations and motions of atoms and fields.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt

Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. Millions of men and women readied themselves for work.

Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run.<n>For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey.

Mission Crew Commander, NEADS: This is what I foresee that we probably need to do. We need to talk to FAA.

Tell 'em if there's more out there, which we don't know, let's get 'em over Manhattan. At least we got some kind of play.<n>The FAA cleared the airspace. Radar data show that at 9:13, when the Otis fighters were about 115 miles away from the city, the fighters exited their holding pattern and set a course direct for Manhattan. They arrived at 9:25 and established a combat air patrol (CAP) over the city.<n>Because the Otis fighters had expended a great deal of fuel in flying first to military airspace and then to New York, the battle commanders were concerned about refueling. NEADS considered scrambling alert fighters from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to New York, to provide backup. The Langley fighters were placed on battle stations at 9:09.137 NORAD had no indication that any other plane had been hijacked.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing. Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room, but as far as we could determine, no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon. The focus was on the President's statement to the nation. The only decision made during this time was to return to Washington.<n>The President's motorcade departed at 9:35, and arrived at the airport between 9:42 and 9:45. During the ride the President learned about the attack on the Pentagon. He boarded the aircraft, asked the Secret Service about the safety of his family, and called the Vice President. According to notes of the call, at about 9:45 the President told the Vice President:"Sounds like we have a minor war going on here, I heard about the Pentagon. We're at war . . . somebody's going to pay."<n>About this time, Card, the lead Secret Service agent, the President's military aide, and the pilot were conferring on a possible destination for Air Force One. The Secret Service agent felt strongly that the situation in Washington was too unstable for the President to return there, and Card agreed. The President strongly wanted to return to Washington and only grudgingly agreed to go elsewhere. The issue was still undecided when the President conferred with the Vice President at about the time Air Force One was taking off. The Vice President recalled urging the President not to return to Washington. Air Force One departed at about 9:54 without any fixed destination. The objective was to get up in the air-as fast and as high as possible-and then decide where to go.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
United 93 and the Shootdown Order On the morning of 9/11, the President and Vice President stayed in contact not by an open line of communication but through a series of calls. The President told us he was frustrated with the poor communications that morning. He could not reach key officials, including Secretary Rumsfeld, for a period of time. The line to the White House shelter conference room-and the Vice President- kept cutting off.<n>The Vice President remembered placing a call to the President just after entering the shelter conference room. There is conflicting evidence about when the Vice President arrived in the shelter conference room. We have concluded, from the available evidence, that the Vice President arrived in the room shortly before 10:00, perhaps at 9:58. The Vice President recalled being told, just after his arrival, that the Air Force was trying to establish a combat air patrol over Washington.<n>The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary.<n>Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization.<n>At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to "engage or "take out" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: "I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out."<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
NORAD officials have maintained consistently that had the passengers not caused United 93 to crash, the military would have prevented it from reaching Washington, D.C. That conclusion is based on a version of events that we now know is incorrect. The Langley fighters were not scrambled in response to United 93; NORAD did not have 47 minutes to intercept the flight; NORAD did not even know the plane was hijacked until after it had crashed. It is appropriate, therefore, to reconsider whether United 93 would have been intercepted.<n>Had it not crashed in Pennsylvania at 10:03, we estimate that United 93 could not have reached Washington any earlier than 10:13, and probably would have arrived before 10:23. There was only one set of fighters circling Washington during that time frame-the Langley F-16s. They were armed and under NORAD's control. After NEADS learned of the hijacking at 10:07, NORAD would have had from 6 to 16 minutes to locate the flight, receive authorization to shoot it down, and communicate the order to the pilots, who (in the same span) would have had to authenticate the order, intercept the flight, and execute the order.<n>At that point in time, the Langley pilots did not know the threat they were facing, did not know where United 93 was located, and did not have shootdown authorization.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe’s southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians.<n>But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century.<n>Under Moorish Rule<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-History.txt
Where the mysteries of Eleusis were only open to a few initiates, advice from the Oracle at Delphi was open to all. It was simply a matter of making your way to the Sanctuary of Apollo, now three hours by road from Athens to the northwest. In ancient times this was the spiritual center of the Greek world and people would travel by land or sea to consult the gods. No important decisions of state could be made without consulting the Oracle here, and when the Colossus of Rhodes was toppled in an earthquake the people of that city-state in the Aegean left it where it lay after advice from the Oracle not to rebuild it.<n>There has been a temple here since pre-historic times when Gaia the Earth-Mother goddess was worshipped. Even in these early times the gods would be consulted with the oracle issuing their verdicts from the Rock of Sybil. Later, Olympian gods usurped Gaia but the sanctuary retained its role. Legend says that the God Apollo arrived at Delphi by sea on a dolphin and slayed the monstrous python that guarded the entrance to the sanctuary. Thus the temple was named in his honor.<n>A modern road cuts through the remains and the approach to the site from the parking lot leads first to the Roman Agora, where pilgrims would stock up on supplies and offerings for the temple only a few minutes away. Here you can see the remains of the Sanctuary of Apollo, the nearby waters of the Kastalian Springs where pilgrims would purify themselves before their consultation, and the Rock of Sybil where the oracle proclaimed the verdict of the gods. The modern museum has a wonderful collection of statuary, treasure, and other artifacts found at the site.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
The American Revolutionary War<n>When the 13 American colonies, enraged by the Stamp Tax, got into the war that eventually brought independence, the Bahamas somewhat reluctantly found itself on England’s side. But reluctance dissolved as profits from privateering once again flowed into Nassau. This time the plundered vessels were American, but not all the victories were won by the privateers. On 3 March 1776, a rebel squadron under Commodore Esek Hopkins arrived and occupied Nassau for two weeks, a bloodless undertaking that emptied the island’s forts of arms and other military supplies. A smaller and equally non-violent American operation against the town in January 1778 lasted less than three days.<n>As the colonies’ war effort picked up steam, both France and Spain weighed in against the British. In May 1782, New Providence surrendered to a large Spanish-American invasion fleet from Cuba and for the next year a Spanish governor ruled the Bahamas.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-History.txt
The longest unbroken island in the Bahamas, slender Eleuthera (pronounced “e-LOOTH-ra”) extends 100 miles (160 km) from north to south yet has many stretches that are barely half a mile (1 km) wide. Some of the wildest Bahamian landscapes are to be found on this island that seems to be more in touch with the moods of the sea than other islands are. The rocky outcrops and sometimes towering waves on the east contrast with calm waters and sandy flats on the west. In the northwest a series of cays and sand banks reach out to fill the 60 miles (96 km) or so between Eleuthera and New Providence.<n>Modern Bahamian history began on this island in 1648 when the Eleutherian Adventurers, led by William Sayle, arrived from Britain and Bermuda and founded their shaky colony. They landed near the site of Governor’s Harbour on the middle of the island, but after a period of feuding Sayle and some of his followers moved north to Harbour Island and Spanish Wells. Their descendants still live there today. Although they named the island Eleuthera, you may find that the local people call the island Cigatoo, its old Lucayan name.<n>Harbour Island, called “Briland” by the locals, sits off the northeastern corner of the main island. You can reach it via a 15-minute ride on a small ferry; taxis from North Eleuthera Airport run reliable service to the docks for a set price per person. The island’s main town, Dunmore Town, is a cluster of narrow streets lined by clapboard houses festooned with bougainvillea; handsome roosters strut here and there in the undergrowth. Boat building and sugar production used to be the main ways the inhabitants earned a living; rum production also made the town popular with Americans during Prohibition. Now tourism is the major industry.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
The North Coast<n>Before the days of flying, most visitors to Bali arrived in the north. The first Dutch military expeditions disembarked near Singaraja, which became the island’s administrative capital and the colony’s chief port. Now, almost everyone arrives and stays in southern Bali, and only a fraction of them ever take a trip to the north coast, although the journey takes less than two hours by road.<n>There is quite a contrast between the south and north. It is hotter and drier in the north and far less densely populated. The proportion of Muslims is higher; some of the people are descended from traders and immigrants from other islands. There is only a narrow strip of flat land between the mountains and the sea, or in some places none at all. Cactus plants are as common as palm trees and the small area of rice depends on irrigation. The region is also dotted with Bali’s local vineyards.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Westward along Jiaominxiang toward Tiananmen Square are the neo-Gothic St. Michael’s Church, built in 1902 by the French and still active. You’ll also find the German Hospital (now the Beijing Hospital) here, and the former embassies of Germany, France, Spain, Holland, and Russia. North up Zhengyi Lu (the former Canal Street) back toward Chang’an Avenue are the former Japanese Legation (now the Beijing Mayor’s office) and the British Legation, once the largest Western stronghold in Beijing (occupied from 1860 to 1959), now the stronghold of the Chinese security services.<n>Southwest of Tiananmen Square, in the city’s Xuanwu District, is the Ox Street Mosque (Niu Jie Qingzhen Si), the center of Beijing’s most vibrant Muslem quarter. Here the capital’s 200,000 people of the Hui minority — largely indistinguishable from Beijing’s Han Chinese majority — practice many of the ways of Islam, which arrived in China from the far western regions of the Silk Road during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). This mosque, originally constructed in the year 996, is Chinese in style but contains a six-sided astronomical tower, a bathhouse, an Islamic prayer hall facing Mecca, a minaret for calling the faithful to prayer, and tombs of Moslem leaders dating to the time of Kublai Khan.<n>Southwest Beijing is also the location of the city’s main Catholic church, South Cathedral (Nan Tang), also known as Mary’s Church. It was constructed on the site of missionary Matteo Ricci’s residence in 1650 and rebuilt for the last time in 1904 after being destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion. Offering masses in Chinese, Latin, and English, South Cathedral has a rock garden dedicated to the Virgin near its southern entrance on Qianmen Street West.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt
Prussia — and Napoleon<n>With his ambition of uniting the states of Brandenburg and Prussia, it was the Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm (1640–1688) who prepared Berlin to become a strong capital, and fortified it as a garrison town. The first newcomers were 50 wealthy Jewish families who had been expelled from Vienna in 1671. Then 14 years later 5,600 Huguenot Protestants arrived after being driven out of France by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. At a time when France was considered the cultural master of Europe, these sophisticated merchants and highly skilled craftsmen — among them jewelers, tailors, chefs, and restaurant-owners — brought a new refinement to the town.<n>This was further enhanced by the Great Elector’s son, who in 1701 crowned himself in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) King Friedrich in (not of) Prussia. Prompted by Sophie Charlotte, his wife, the king founded academies for the arts and sciences in Berlin. Baroque master Andreas Schlüter (see page 48) was commissioned to redesign the royal palace, which was knocked down in 1951 to make way for East Germany’s Palast der Republik. Sophie Charlotte’s residence, the grand Schloß Charlottenburg, has survived as a model of the era’s elegance.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt
Prussia’s success during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) placed it at the head of a new united Germany. Under Kaiser Wilhelm I and Otto von Bismarck, Berlin became the Reichshauptstadt (capital of the empire). By 1880, amid the industrial expansion of the Gründerzeit (founding years), the city’s population soared past the million mark. Berlin boomed as the center of Germany’s machine industry and was a perfect market for mass-circulation newspapers and big department stores such as KaDeWe (Kaufhaus des Westens), founded in 1907.<n>After that philistine period of rapid growth, the city at last began to assume its place as Germany’s cultural as well as political capital, with Berlin artists Max Liebermann, Lovis Corinth, and Max Slevogt challenging Munich’s dominance of German painting. The Berlin Philharmonic asserted an international prestige, attracting Tchaikovsky, Strauss, and Grieg as guest composers, and in 1905, the great Viennese director Max Reinhardt arrived to head the Deutsches Theater.<n>Among its scientists, Robert Koch won a Nobel prize for his discovery of the Tuberculosis bacillus, and Max Planck headed the new Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science (later named the Max-Planck-Institut), with Albert Einstein as director of the physics department.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt
St. George’s Harbour and Penno’s Wharf were working at full capacity to unload cargoes that were then transferred onto blockade-runners. These long, slim vessels were specially designed to outrun the Union navy’s picket ships. They made their way to Wilmington, North Carolina, the closest Confederate port to Bermuda. Here they would take on a new cargo of cotton — a most profitable ballast that increased in value tenfold by the time it was delivered to buyers in Britain. St. George’s boomed during the Civil War; the town seethed with sailors, speculators, Confederate agents, and Union spies. When General Lee laid down his sword in 1865, it was as if Bermuda, too, had lost a war.<n>In the years that followed, Bermuda’s fortunes picked up as the first steamships began to arrive on a regular basis. In 1883 Princess Louise (daughter of Queen Victoria) arrived on a lengthy visit en route to her new home farther north, as the wife of the Governor General of Canada. She extolled Bermuda to those in her upper-class English circles, and wealthy tourists began to arrive soon thereafter. By the turn of the century, Bermuda was a well-known winter destination for visitors from the US and Canada as well as Britain. The Princess Hotel was opened in Hamilton in 1885 to commemorate the visit.<n>Three More Wars<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-history.txt
Start at King’s Square on the waterfront. Originally known as “Market Square,” it was the center of all activity for the town. Here you will find the Tourist Information office, whose helpful staff will be able to supply you with information about the day’s activities. On the east side of the square is the Town Hall, which dates from 1782. Although relatively young by St. George’s standards, it has wonderful cedar wood floors and ceilings. Here you can find out about the previous lord mayors and view a commemorative “Charles and Diana” signature, harkening back to happy times.<n>At the northwest corner of the square is the Bermuda Museum of the National Trust. This 17th-century building was constructed by Governor Samuel Day, who arrived from England, found the old governor’s house in disrepair, and built this house using government land and government wood — yet he refused to hand over the house when he was ousted from office after only two years. The house became a hotel, the Globe, in the mid-19th century but attracted notoriety again in the early 1860s when it became the office of a Confederate agent during the US Civil War. In 1952, the house was acquired by the Bermuda Historical Monuments Trust and was opened as a museum in 1961, with substantial refurbishment in 1996.<n>On the ground floor, pride of place is given to a detailed model of Somers’s ship, Sea Venture. Many American visitors are also fascinated by a replica of a machine commissioned by the Congress of the Confederate States that stamped a seal for all their official documents. There is also a short video presentation called “Bermuda: Centre of the Atlantic,” which tells the story of the founding and development of the island. Climb the stairs to the first floor, where the so-called Rogues and Runners Museum presents a detailed exposition of Bermuda’s role in the American Civil War. Bermuda had many ties with the southern states through both business and family bloodlines. Although Britain officially remained neutral, Bermudians favored the South, wanting to help their friends — and make a lot of money in the process. A series of short information boards brings to life different aspects of this intriguing time in Bermuda’s history. Sadly, it also documents the true story of the blockade-runner Fannie, which returned from one trip in June 1864 with two sick crew members. The yellow fever they carried soon spread across Bermuda, killing many hundreds of people. Graves in the Royal Naval Cemetery (near the dockyard at the other end of Bermuda) offer testimony to some of the individuals who succumbed to this dreadful disease.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
At the top of King Street is State House, built in the 1620s to house Bermuda’s Assembly. Today it is the oldest stone building on the island. The plain façade and sturdy walls were designed to withstand hurricanes and the worst of the summer humidity. It was used continuously until 1815, when the island’s capital was moved from St. George’s to Hamilton. The local Masonic lodge negotiated with the Assembly to use the building, with a rent of one peppercorn per year, a price that remains in force to this day. The “peppercorn” rent is handed over to the crown in one of the most ornate ceremonial occasions of the year, with the mayor and town officials in full official regalia.<n>Water Street leads away from King’s Square to the west. It has many shops selling tax-free goods; the modern shops occupy space in much older buildings. Wander along the traffic-free thoroughfare to do some leisurely souvenir hunting. On your right, watch for Tucker House Museum, which was from 1775 the home of Henry Tucker, the President of the Governor’s Council. The Tuckers were one of the most influential families on Bermuda, the first family member having arrived on the island in 1616. In 1950, a descendant — an American named Robert Tucker — bequeathed many family heirlooms to the house in his will. The kitchen area, originally separated from the main house, was once a barbershop operated by Henry Raine, a black man who came to Bermuda to escape the worst of the American Civil War. Once the war was over, he and his family returned to the US, where he became the first black member elected to the House of Representatives.<n>Across the street is the Carriage Museum. Until the 1940s, horses and carriages were the only modes of transportation permitted along the narrow Bermuda roads, and almost every well-to-do family had a horse-drawn vehicle. However, these disappeared almost immediately following a relaxation of the strict rules that had kept motor vehicles off the island. This collection of beautiful carriages celebrates those “gone-but-not-forgotten” days.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
The First Hungarians<n>The tribes that were ultimately to settle in the land arrived in 896. They had wandered a long way from their home east of the Ural Mountains, and fell upon the land with such ferocity that the local people thought they too were Huns (one might be tempted to think this is the origin of the English Hungary).<n>But they were actually Magyars (the Hungarian word for Hungarians); their language was strange to outsiders. The tribe’s name for itself became the name of the country and its language, as well. Related tribes, who had earlier travelled northwest while the Magyars migrated west, ended up in Finland. Their mutually incomprehensible tongues are classiﬁed together in the linguistic ﬁeld as Finno-Ugric.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-History.txt
A Brief History<n>The first wave of California immigrants arrived somewhere between 20,000 and 35,000 years ago — wandering Asiatic tribes who entered the American continent via the Bering Strait, which at that time was dry land, or perhaps covered in ice. In the succeeding centuries, their descendants continued to push south and east, and eventually spread out to people the whole of the continent from Alaska to Patagonia. The tribes who decided to settle in what is now California were fortunate in their choice of homeland. The climate was very pleasant, and food was sufficiently plentiful for them to avoid the constant warfare that plagued many tribes elsewhere in the Americas.<n>The Indian tribes lived in harmony with nature. Anticipating 1960s flower children seeking drug-induced enlightenment, medicine men drank the juice of the jimson weed to provoke revelatory hallucinations. However, not even their wildest visions prepared them for the arrival of bearded men armed with swords and crossbows, in whose wake the Indian population plummeted from a peak of 275,000 to a mere 16,000 at the start of the 20th century.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-History.txt
The early years of statehood were marked by a rough-and-ready kind of justice. In the absence of a well-established judiciary or organized police force, law and order was enforced by vigilantes, and summary hanging was the usual sentence.<n>The Chinese arrived in the wake of the great Taiping Rebellion of 1851, seeking security and prosperity in what they were told were California’s “Golden Mountains.” They suffered both exploitation by Chinese entrepreneurs, who used them as indentured labor, and discriminatory taxation by the state legislature. The worst-treated, however, were the Native Americans, whose numbers dwindled rapidly not only as a result of disease and malnutrition but also because of systematic massacres in the 1850s by Californian militia.<n>In 1859 the discovery of silver (the Comstock Lode in western Nevada) caused a Silver Rush in the reverse direction, with the mining being organized almost completely from California. As the state’s economy expanded, its major priority became a transcontinental railway to connect it to the eastern markets. Engineer Theodore Judah defied all the experts by plotting a railway link between Sacramento and the East, passing right through the heart of the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky mountains. He managed to sell his idea to a San Francisco consortium that became known as the Central Pacific’s “Big Four” — Mark Hopkins, Collis Huntington, Charles Crocker, and Leland Stanford, names that continue to echo in both the streets and institutions of present-day California.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-History.txt
The city of Lompoc (Route 135 and Route 1 from Santa Maria) sits prettily among the fields of flowers that have made it the “Flower-Growing Capital of the World.” On the edge of town is La Purísima Mission, founded in 1787 and rebuilt in 1813 after an earthquake. It is the most extensively and authentically restored of California’s 21 Franciscan missions, and the old pink-and-white adobe walls provide a haven of peace amid the former living and working quarters of missionaries, soldiers, and Native Americans. The garden is full of olive and mulberry trees, and livestock such as burros, turkeys, and four-horned churro sheep all contribute to the 1820s atmosphere.<n>When you get to Santa Barbara you know for sure that you’ve arrived in Southern California. Its palm-fringed streets, red-tile pavements, and low-rise Spanish Revival buildings spread up the hillsides from the beautiful beach, oozing sun-tanned health and the scent of money. It’s a favorite weekend retreat for many of Los Angeles’ wealthier residents.<n>On State Street, which runs from the beach up through the center of town, you’ll find a thriving downtown filled with stores, theaters, and restaurants. In particular, take a peek at the Arlington Theater; the inside was designed to mimic a Spanish-style courtyard at dusk, including a star-filled sky. There’s history on display, too, at Mission Santa Barbara (corner of Laguna and Mission streets). The mission, which was founded on 4 December 1786, the Feast of St. Barbara, offers a self-guided tour of its restored church and outbuildings. Also worth a visit is the beautiful Santa Barbara County Courthouse — a magnificent Spanish-Moorish–style edifice dating from 1927.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
The Kwakiutl<n>For the relative opulence of their way of life, the Kwakiutl of British Columbia’s Pacific coast on and around Vancouver Island count among the aristocrats of Canadian native peoples. For centuries, they have harvested an abundance of fish from the ocean and rivers — not just salmon but halibut, herring, mussels, and clams. From the forests they have hewed red cedar planks for handsomely crafted houses and 22-m (65-ft) canoes to negotiate the coastal waters. Before European textiles arrived on the scene, the Kwakiutl pounded cedar bark until it was supple and soft enough to weave into capes, skirts, and blankets.<n>The mild climate and generally easy living have given them the leisure to develop artistic talents less apparent among native peoples and Inuit facing harsher conditions. Elaborate decoration has gone into fashioning the simplest everyday objects — clothing, baskets, storage boxes, even fishhooks. Carpentry is the most valued of Kwakiutl skills, and is spectacularly displayed in their totem poles. But this is not an ancient art form. The huge freestanding red cedar poles erected in front of their houses are essentially a 19th-century phenomenon, dependent, for their intricate design, on the chisels, steel axes, curved knives, and other metal tools bartered from Europeans for the skins of sea otters. Size was originally limited to that of the poles and beams used to build the house, to which the carvings were directly attached. Then, as personal wealth diminished with a slump in the fur trade, totem poles became prime symbols of a chief’s prestige, soaring to 26 m (80 ft) and more. While they survive now only in museums, especially in Vancouver (see page 155) the ritual gift giving known as potlatch has re-emerged after years of official prohibition. Derived from the Nootka Indian word patschatl, meaning “to give,” the potlatch traditionally enabled a chief to demonstrate his prestige to neighboring tribes. For a year or more he gathered up his tribe’s surplus wealth — considerable during the boom years of the fur trade — to throw a huge party. In addition to a splendid feast, the host would hand out gifts of oil, carvings, jewels, prized iron tools, and, above all, the coveted Hudson’s Bay Company blanket, sometimes as many as 10,000 of them. While the host tribe’s houses were emptied of everything except bare essentials, the guests would depart knowing that in a year or two they would have to reciprocate if they were not to lose face.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt
St. John’s<n>Local folklore insists that the name (not to be confused with Saint John, New Brunswick) comes from the saint’s day of John the Baptist, June 24, when John Cabot arrived here in 1497.<n>Newfoundland’s capital and largest city retains the simple allure of the fishing port it has always been, and the picturesque harbor is the place to begin. In the 19th century the town burned down five times, but it still stubbornly builds wooden houses overlooking the waterfront. Their brightly painted walls add a welcome touch of color to the gaunt grey trawlers in the docks — from Britain, of course, but also Russia and even Japan. Parallel to the harbor, you’ll find on Gower Street the prettiest Victorian houses, painted burgundy, lemon, burnt sienna, dove grey, and white.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Regina<n>The queen Latinized in the provincial capital’s name is, of course, Victoria. The city’s decorum would please her. It’s been cleaned up considerably since the first settlers arrived in the 1880s and found the banks of the Wascana Creek littered with hundreds of buffalo bones. Indian hunters used to dry their buffalo meat and stretch the hides by the creek, and left the bones in a heap. The town was known as Pile of Bones until they were ground up for fertilizer.<n>Today, you’ll find the buffalo, along with other regional wildlife, prehistoric and present-day, in the Museum of Natural History, on Albert Street. The museum is south of the city center in the very pretty Wascana Park, one of the few places in southern Saskatchewan where you’ll see any trees. The creek has been dammed to form a lake, with a bird sanctuary out on Willow Island. Also in the park is the provincial Legislative Building, with an interesting portrait gallery of Indian chiefs on the ground floor. On Lakeview Drive is the Diefenbaker Homestead, brought here from near Saskatoon to give a vivid insight into the simple country life led by Saskatchewan’s most famous son before he went off to Ottawa “to show them Yanks and Ruskies a thing or two.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Long before the first European sailors beached in the Canaries, all seven islands were inhabited. The original Canarians came to be called Guanches, meaning in the native tongue “man.” Strictly speaking, this name applies only to the original inhabitants of Tenerife.<n>The Guanches are thought to have arrived in the islands around the 1st or 2nd century b.c., probably from North Africa. Ethnographers link them with the Cro-Magnon and Proto-Mediterranean race. They were tall, light-skinned, often blue-eyed and blond-haired. You can see their remains in the meticulous collection of the Museo Canario in Las Palmas on Gran Canaria. Here too you can study their preoccupation with death. Like the ancient Egyptians they carefully embalmed their dead, presumably for a ceremonial passage to the next world. Cryptic rock carvings have been found that may explain these rituals, but so far no one has found the Canarian version of the Rosetta Stone with which to decipher them.<n>Another baffling mystery is how the Guanches arrived on the islands. No evidence of Guanche boats has ever been discovered; so were they marooned here by pirates or perhaps exiled by their own people? One theory is that they may have floated across from North Africa on reed craft. The expeditions of Thor Heyerdahl do lend some credence to this idea, and the concept is explored in great detail at the Pyramids of Güímar on Tenerife.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-History.txt

Cave dwelling in such a climate is a logical idea, being cooler in summer and warmer in winter than more conventional accommodations. Even today, there are many cave dwellings in the islands.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-History.txt
The Maya<n>These people’s ancestors arrived in Central America many thousands of years ago. Small bands of Asiatic hunters migrated across the Bering Strait land bridge before 12,000 b.c. and gradually spread southwards through the Americas. During the Archaic period (after 5,200 b.c.), these people settled in what is now modern Mexico. They developed a primitive agriculture, domesticating cattle and cultivating corn, beans, chili peppers, and squash (a pumpkin-like vegetable) in burned clearings in the jungle. Over time, a society developed that was so successful they could devote time to activities other than simple food cultivation. These people, known as the Olmec, are considered to be the first Mesoamerican culture, the one from which all others evolved. They developed a calendar based on a 52-year cycle. They also constructed pyramids for worship.<n>By 1500 b.c. the group that came to be known as the Maya settled in an area which stretched from the Pacific coast to the southern Yucatán, taking in modern-day Guatemala, Belize, the western parts of El Salvador and Honduras, and the Mexican state of Campeche. In the succeeding centuries they migrated into the northern Yucatán — what are now the modern Mexican states of Yucatán, Quintana Roo, and part of Tabasco.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt
But there was a dark side to this sophisticated society. The Maya viewed their gods not as benevolent guides but as changeable spirits in need of constant appeasement. To incur the wrath of the gods would result in drought, a loss of crops, and certain starvation. To keep the gods happy, the people offered sacrifices at their great pyramid temples. The ceremonies were overseen by a powerful caste of high priests. Grain and animals were used, but the gods came to demand more, and a cult of human sacrifice grew. The Maya went out on raiding parties, taking hostages from the surrounding lands to use in their bloody ceremonies. The murals and reliefs at Mayan cities tell gory tales of beheading and the tearing out of human hearts to appease the lords of the underworld. Archaeologists dredging the Sacred Cenote of Chichén Itzá have recovered dozens of human skeletons, thought to be the remains of victims sacrificed to the rain god.<n>Mayan civilization in the northern Yucatán reached its peak around a.d. 900–1200. For reasons still unknown — perhaps civil war, drought, or disease — the great cities were abandoned. By the time the Spaniards arrived in the early 16th century the jungle was reclaiming the pyramids; the richly painted murals of warriors, Mayan lords, animals, and gods were already crumbling and dissolving in the warm rain. The priest caste seemed to have vanished, along with their knowledge. The only people the Spanish found were farmers.<n>In the Wake of Cortés<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt
Isla Mujeres (Island of the Women) lies only 8 km (5 miles) offshore from Cancún; the 40-minute ferry ride transports you from an ultra-modern atmosphere to an environment in which time moves more slowly. Several companies offer one-day sailing trips to Isla Mujeres, often including lunch and snorkeling; they depart from Playa Linda and Pier Tortugas in the Hotel Zone.<n>Isla Mujeres now has a population of around 15,000. In past centuries, however, it was the haunt of Caribbean pirates, being far from the clutches of colonial overlords in Havana, San Juan in Puerto Rico, and Panama City, the nearest colonial outposts. The earliest recorded visitors arrived in 1517, when Spanish explorer Francisco Hernández de Córdoba landed to discover a number of small temples built for the goddess of fertility Ix chel. It was he who named the island. Mujeres is only 8 km (5 miles) in length, less than a kilometer (1⁄2 mile) at its widest point, and split by inland lakes and bays. One main road forms an ellipse, following the shape of the coastline.<n>Most ferries deposit you at the very northern tip of the island, on the main pier of the only town on Mujeres. Craft shops and bars crowd onto the sidewalks and sandy streets. The place bustles, especially when the ferries arrive. As afternoon turns to evening and the day-trippers head back to Cancún, Isla Mujeres takes on a much quieter character. The island has many loyal fans that return year after year for its particular atmosphere. Many who choose to stay come for the diving, which usually means low-key entertainment and early nights.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
Nanjing means “Southern Capital,” a name conferred rather late in the city’s history. During its early grandeur under the State of Chu, the town was called “Jinling,” a name still used in literary and other allusions. Then in the third century, in the era of the Three Kingdoms, it was christened “Jianye.” Under that or similar titles it served as the capital of six southern dynasties. The Ming emperors made it the national capital, but this was soon moved north to Beijing in the 15th century.<n>In the 20th century a series of dramas overtook Nanjing and gave it new prominence. It was here that Dr. Sun Yat-sen was elected president of the republic. Chiang Kai-shek made it his capital until the advance of Japanese invasion forces induced him to head west. When the Japanese troops finally arrived here in 1937, the “Rape of Nanking” was added to the catalogue of war’s atrocities. A monument (Datusha Jinianguan) just outside the old city wall commemorates the victims; around 100,000 died in the first four days alone. The Nationalists regained the battered city after the Japanese surrender in 1945. The Communist army crossed the Yangzi (which the Chinese people call Changjiang, or “Long River”) in April 1949, bringing the new order to the old capital.<n>The Yangzi River Bridge (Nanjing Changjiang Daqiao) is an extraordinary engineering achievement. Only a few bridges span the entire river, and this is the longest: at 1,577 m over water, it is a little less than a mile. Proudly claimed to be the world’s longest two-tier bridge for rail and road traffic, it has greatly improved contacts between North and South China. And it inspired national self-confidence at the time of the Sino-Soviet schism of 1960. When the Soviet Union withdrew its technical experts, the Chinese built it themselves, in eight years.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
The French Quarter<n>West of the riverside and old Chinese section is a landmark of modern history: the low brick building at 76 Xingyelu, where the Chinese Communist Party was founded in July 1921. This was in the French concession, and when the French police learned of the clandestine meeting, they raided the two-story corner house. But they arrived too late to find the 12 conspirators, including Mao Zedong. The Communist founding fathers continued their congress aboard a hired excursion boat on a lake. The house is today a museum with documents and displays.<n>Today, much of the finest European architecture in Shanghai is most visible in and around the French Quarter. Art-Deco and Tudor villas, neo-Gothic offices, and large elegant mansions line many of the small streets. The modern Garden Hotel (58 Maominglu) preserves the original lobby area of the Cercle Sportif Français from the 1920s. The Shanghai Arts and Crafts Research Institute is housed in a wonderful old French mansion (79 Fenyanglu) and allows visitors to view artisans at work on embroidery, paper cutting, and other crafts.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
With so many traditional arts centered at one historic site, it’s no wonder the Shaolin Monastery has become one of China’s more popular tourist attractions. Shaolin now provides movie sets for film crews as well as schools for domestic and foreign classes in self-defense. As an excursion, it is close to Zhengzhou (80 km/50 miles to the east) and Luoyang (70 km/43 miles west).<n>You don’t have to be a kung fu practitioner to enjoy Shaolin. While crowded and commercialized, Shaolin is still one of China’s most interesting historical and religious monuments, dating back to the end of the fifth century a.d. In 625 it was expanded by a Tang Dynasty emperor in gratitude for wartime services rendered by the Shaolin monks, who used their fighting skills to send off some usurpers. In the early sixth century, a monk from India named Da Mo arrived at Shaolin, where he founded Chan Buddhism. Da Mo, who was probably a legendary rather than actual figure, is also heralded as the founder of kung fu (wushu), a system of hand-to-hand combat that was later modified to produce the immensely popular form of exercise that millions practice every morning throughout China — taiqi (tai chi), sometimes called “shadow boxing” in the West.<n>The Shaolin monks do seem to have been well-versed in self-defense over the centuries. In the 16th century they were called upon to rid China’s coast of Japanese pirates. In 1928, when warlords carved up sections of the faltering Chinese Republic, one general laid siege to the monastery and set it ablaze.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Nanchang, Jiangxi Province. Founded in the Han Dynasty, Nanchang is the provincial capital and main industrial center of the subtropical Jiangxi Province. In 1927 it was the setting for the first Communist-led armed uprising against the Nationalist forces. A number of relics of Zhou Enlai and other leaders of the Nanchang Uprising have been preserved in the city’s museum, which is devoted to the insurrection.<n>Ningbo (Ningpo), Zhejiang Province. Situated down the coast from Shanghai, this port town has a long history of overseas connections. First it was involved in trade with Japan. Then the Portuguese arrived and settled here. Finally, a British consulate was established in the town after the end of the Opium Wars. The sights include a thousand-year-old wooden temple and a Ming Dynasty library in a pretty garden.<n>Qufu (Chufu), Shandong Province. The birthplace of Confucius has been turned into an architectural ensemble on the scale of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The memorial temple was begun in 478 b.c., the year after the philosopher’s death, and improvements and expansions went on for another 2,000 years. The compound itself contains ceremonial gateways, palaces, pavilions, and shrines. The tombs of Confucius and most of his descendants are set among ancient pines and cypress to the north of the town.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
The Phoenicians ventured across the Mediterranean from present-day Lebanon, reaching Spain by about 1100 b.c. They founded many trading settlements in the “remote” or “hidden land” they named Span or Spania. The Costa Blanca was soon dotted with such Phoenician towns as Elche and Játiva.<n>After about 650 b.c., Greek traders arrived on the coast to compete for Spain’s rich mineral deposits and fertile land. The influence of Greece was short-lived, although the olive and the grape, Greek legacies, are cultivated in the region.<n>The Carthaginians, a people related to the Phoenicians, came from North Africa and subsequently took over much of southern Spain, beginning with Cádiz in 501 b.c. The town had sought help from the Carthaginian army in its war against local tribes, and the “invited guest” decided to stay. The main centre of Carthaginian power in Spain was located on the Costa Blanca: Carthago Nova, now Cartagena, followed in prominence by Alicante.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-History.txt
Moorish Domination<n>In a.d. 711, the Arab chief Tariq landed at Gibraltar with 12,000 Berber troops. Thus began an 800-year epoch of Christian opposition to the newly arrived Muslims. The Moors—the name commonly given to all Muslims in Spain—carried all before them. Within ten years their green-crescent standard flew over most of Spain. Kartajanah, Mursiyah, and Xativa are still known by their Moorish names.<n>The Moors were relatively tolerant rulers who taxed non-believers rather than trying to convert them. They introduced the manufacture of paper, which is carried on today in Játiva. They laid out a system of irrigation still in use in the Guadalest Valley and filled the huertas (orchards) of the Costa Blanca with oranges, peaches, and pomegranates. Rice, cotton, and sugar cane were also first cultivated on Spanish soil by the Moors.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-History.txt
The Golden Age<n>Spain’s golden century began under the “Catholic Monarchs,” a title conferred by Pope Alexander VI on Ferdinand II and Isabella, who united the country under the Christian kingdoms of Aragon and Castile after the fall of Granada in 1492. That same eventful year, Columbus, seeking a western route to the East on behalf of the Catholic Monarchs, arrived in the Americas. And Ferdinand and Isabella consolidated Christian rule by decreeing that all Jews—the banking and business experts—must adopt Catholicism or be exiled. The Moors —the source of cheap labour and vital agricultural know-how—were given the same alternative in 1502.<n>The Segura Valley was the last part of Spain to be inhabited by Muslims, who abandoned their fortresses there in 1505. As the Inquisition established its reign of terror to stamp out heresy, converted Jews, conversos, and Muslims, moriscos, were looked upon with suspicion, and many left the country or were condemned to death. Agricultural productivity was to suffer considerably after the official expulsion of the moriscos in 1609.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-History.txt
The southern part of Spain is at a geographical crossroads: It is the gateway between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, and the crossing point between Africa and Europe. The strategic importance of its location has given rise to a long and turbulent history.<n>The earliest evidence of human occupation is provided by the Paleolithic cave paintings, some 25,000 years old, in the Cueva de la Pileta. Neolithic peoples arrived on the scene in the fourth millennium b.c., leaving behind signs of early attempts at agriculture and fragments of their pottery. Tribes of Iberians from North Africa crossed over into Spain around 3000 b.c., and initiated Spain’s first experiments in architecture; Spain’s oldest structure stands near Antequera, a dolmen burial chamber known as the Cueva de Romeral. After 900 b.c., wandering bands of Celts entered the peninsula from northern Europe, and brought to the area their knowledge of bronze and iron work. As they moved farther south, the Celts merged with the Iberians, and began to build walled villages along the coast.<n>Traders and Colonizers<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt
The capital of Andalucía, Sevilla is the most Spanish of Spanish cities. One of the most beautiful cities in the world, it has a sensual, spiritual, and romantic ambience.<n>It was already a thriving riverside settlement when Julius Caesar arrived in 45 b.c., and under the Romans, it developed into a major town. In fact, two Roman emperors, Hadrian and Trajan, were born in nearby Itálica. Subsequently, Sevilla became the capital of the Visigothic kingdom and then of a Moorish taifa, before falling to King Ferdinand III in 1248. A monopoly of trade with the New World brought the city to its peak during the Golden Age. “Madrid is the capital of Spain,” the saying went, “but Sevilla is the capital of the world.”<n>The two most prominent monuments in the city are located around the Plaza del Triunfo. Work on the cathedral, the largest Gothic church in the world and the third largest of its kind — only St. Peter’s in Rome and St. Paul’s in London are bigger — began in 1401 after the great mosque was razed. The new building followed the ground plan of the old mosque, accounting for its unusually broad, rectangular form.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Christian Birthpains<n>The apostle Paul arrived in a.d. 59 with his disciple Titus, whom he left behind to convert the islanders to Christianity. Titus had a hard time combating the Cretans’ pagan beliefs, and was martyred for his overzealous efforts. But Christianity eventually triumphed to achieve the strong Orthodoxy of today, and Titus became Crete’s patron saint.<n>When Roman power split in two, the eastern Byzantine Empire inherited the island (though its hold on islands in the south of its dominion were, in reality, nominal). Attacks by pirates and Islamic forces brought terror to the people, but Cretans remained loyal to the Orthodox Church throughout the Arab occupation of a.d. 824–961. The island was recaptured after a terrible siege of Iráklion by Byzantine commander Nikephóros Phokás. He catapulted the heads of dead Arabs into the city to dishearten those still defending the citadel.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-History.txt
Finally, in 1898, the European powers forced the Turks to grant Crete autonomy within the Ottoman Empire and accept Prince George, second son of the Greek king, as governor. This did not satisfy the people and the prince was forced to resign only a few years later under threat of revolt and the demand for union with Greece. It was only in 1913, under the leadership of Elefthérios Venizélos, a native Cretan, that the longed-for énosis (union) was achieved.<n>Though unscathed by World War I, Crete saw major changes in the mid 1920s. The Atatürk revolution, which announced a new Turkish Republic, brought massive upheaval through the area with a forced population exchange between Greece and Turkey beginning in 1923. Thousands of Turks were evacuated, and thousands of Greek refugees from Asia Minor arrived to take their place. However, agricultural resources and output were improved and the new arrivals soon began to settle. The new science of archaeology was also developing, and excavations of Minoan palaces brought a new prosperity as the 20th-century phenomenon of tourism grew.<n>War and Peace<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-History.txt
Washington remained fundamentally opposed to Cuba’s political evolution and sought to isolate Castro in Latin America. Soon after the Bay of Pigs, Castro declared himself a Marxist-Leninist. Castro had not displayed any Communist inclinations in the 1950s, and some suggest that US aggression pushed him to ingratiate himself with the powerful Soviet Union and its Eastern block of potential trading partners. By the end of the 1980s, more than 80 percent of Cuban trade was with the USSR, which also provided Cuba with a subsidy of state support worth an estimated US$5 billion annually.<n>In 1962 Soviet president Nikita Khrushchev installed 42 medium-range nuclear missiles in Cuba. US president John F. Kennedy imposed a naval blockade on the island to ensure no more missiles arrived and insisted that the existing ones be removed. After six days of eyeball-to-eyeball challenge (now known in the US as the “Cuban Missile Crisis”), the potential nuclear disaster was averted when Khrushchev backed down in return for a US promise never to invade Cuba.<n>The Special Period<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-History.txt
A block north of the Plaza Mayor is the Museo Nacional de la Lucha Contra Bandidos (National Museum of the Struggle against the Bandits), housed in a former convent. The bandits in question were counter-revolutionary rebels who hid in the Escambray mountains during the 1960s. The stupendous 360-degree view from the yellow belltower (a landmark) is the big draw.<n>A block south of Plaza Mayor on Calle Simón Bolivar stands the grand Palacio Cantero, built in 1830. Painted pillars, scrolls, shells, pediments, and drapes embellish the interior, eclipsing the historical artifacts and old furniture that now form the Museo Municipal de Historia. It has its own fine tower, though climbing its rickety narrow steps can be a trial if a group has arrived there first.<n>The tiny Piro Guinart cigar factory (on Maceo at the corner of Colón) has only about 30 hand rollers and allows visitors to take a peek inside. A block south of the Plaza Mayor are two streets completely given over to sellers of handmade lace and other crafts.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
Boudhanath, 6 km (4 miles) northeast of the city center, is the valley’s second important stupa and is similar in many ways to Swayambhunath. The temple, constructed around a.d. 500, is encircled by monasteries, shops, and lodges for pilgrims. It cannot be seen fully until you enter its precincts through a narrow passage from the street. Then it looms above you, 38 m (125 ft) high, streamers of prayer flags fluttering gaily against the sky. It is possible to reach terraces around the dome by climbing a staircase guarded by painted, man-bearing stone elephants. The all-seeing eyes here seem genuinely penetrating, almost glowering above the whitewashed dome. The question mark “nose” is actually the Nepali numeral one, meaning the only way to enlightenment is by following the rules of conduct laid down by the Buddha.<n>Boudhanath has attracted Tibetan monks and pilgrims for centuries, and over the years a Tibetan and Sherpa community has grown in this area. Many of the people you will see circumambulating Boudhanath are Tibetans rather than Nepalis, and those with long braids and wild costumes are usually Tibetans who have only recently arrived in Kathmandu. Also keep an eye out for pilgrims who prostrate themselves repeatedly as they circle the stupa.<n>Where Swayambhunath is cluttered with monuments in different styles, at Boudhanath there are no other temples to distract pilgrims. There are, however, dozens of shops specializing in Tibetan antiques and other Tibetan souvenirs. Pilgrims coming from Tibet, as well as local refugees, supply the shops that ring the stupa with the city’s best selection of Tibetan antiques. There are also shops filled with bronze Buddhist statuary, silver ornaments, prayer wheels, and brass “singing bowls.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
Meanwhile, a European with an eye for chance had ingratiated his way into the French court at Versailles. John Law, a Scotsman, financier, and high-rolling gambler, on the run from England after a fatal duel, saw the possibility of promoting this distant marshland as a paradise. Luckily for New Orleans, his scheme was a remarkable success.<n>Law brokered a deal with the French government, giving him a 25-year charter to develop the Louisiana Territory. All he needed were investors and settlers, whom he lured with a campaign of propaganda. On posters Law distributed in France, New Orleans was pictured as a prosperous seaport. When Law’s clients arrived after months at sea, the truth of the Mississippi Bubble was plain. The only housing available was huts or tents, and the roads were generally quagmires. But there was nowhere else to go, so the pioneers were forced to pitch in and try to survive.<n>John Law’s promotional activities weren’t confined to the French. He signed up some 10,000 Germans, mostly Rhinelanders, to share the “golden future” in Louisiana. Today, west of New Orleans along what is called the German Coast, you can see towns with names like Hahnville, Kraemer, and Des Allemands. Most descendants of the German pioneers, however, Frenchified their names, thus Delmaire was originally Edelmeyer and Fauquel was Vogel.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_NewOrleans-History.txt

In 1724, the Bienville enacted the Code Noir (Black Code), which regulated the conditions of slavery and the rights of free blacks. The code, more liberal than the laws elsewhere in the South, remained in force in Louisiana for a century. As for the Mississippi Bubble, it burst in 1720. France came out of the deal bankrupt and with huge pieces of land considered to be worthless.

Officially renamed place Charles de Gaulle after the death of the great man in 1969, it is still known to Parisians as l’Etoile (the star) for the twelve avenues branching out from the center like a star. The circular space with its whirling traffic is dominated by the Arc de Triomphe, 50 m (164 ft) high and 45 m (148 ft) wide. A trip to the top by elevator affords spectacular views. It is here that you can best appreciate the tour de force of geometric planning the avenues represent.<n>The Arc de Triomphe was conceived by Napoléon I as a tribute to his armies, and bears the names of hundreds of his marshals and generals, and dozens of victories. No defeats are recorded, naturally, although a few of the victories are debatable. Napoléon himself only ever saw a wood and canvas model: the arch was completed during the 1830s. It soon became the focus for state occasions, such as the return of the ex-emperor’s own remains from St. Helena in 1840 and the funeral of Victor Hugo in 1885. In 1920, the Unknown Soldier of World War I was buried at the arch; three years later the eternal flame was lit. When Adolf Hitler arrived in Paris as a conqueror in 1940, the Arc de Triomphe was the first place he wanted to see. And at the Liberation, this was the spot where General de Gaulle commenced his triumphal march down the Champs-Elysées.<n>Avenue Foch, leading away from l’Etoile to the Bois de Boulogne, is one of the most majestic of the city’s residential avenues. It is one of the most exclusive, too, though somewhat democratized these days by the groups of boules players on its graveled side paths. Avenue de la Grande-Armée points straight to Neuilly and the towers of La Défense with the Grande Arche behind.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
Foundations of the Polish State<n>The region that would become Poland, a great plain sandwiched between the Vistula and Odra rivers, has been inhabited since the Stone Age by migratory tribal peoples — among them Celts, Balts, Huns, Slavs and Mongols. Tribal culture reigned, untouched by the more sophisticated civilization of the Roman Empire. Slavic tribes arrived by the eighth century a.d. and put down roots; the •lezanie, Mazowszanie, Pomorzanie and Wislanie peoples inhabited much of the territory. The Polonian tribe, which settled the area that today is western Poland around Poznan, provided the foundations for the development of a Polish language and nation.<n>Prince Mieszko, leader of the Piast dynasty that ruled the Polonians, undertook the bold step to unify the Polanie (literally, “people of the fields”) and neighboring tribes. Mieszko adopted Christianity — most likely a savvy political move to place the new state on equal footing with nearby Christian states with ties to Rome — and married a Czech princess, Dobrava, in 965. His religious conversion won him the support of the papacy, and Mieszko effectively founded the Polish state the following year. By the end of the 10th century, he had united his tribal territory, Wielkopolska (Great Poland), with that of another tribe, Malopolska (Little Poland) — regional names that remain current today. Silesia, settled by a different tribe, would eventually become the third component of the nascent Polish state.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Poland-History.txt
To the pirates and privateers who sailed the Caribbean in the early 16th century, the fortress of El Morro at San Juan represented the might, and the wealth, of the Spanish Crown. Lured by the promise of treasure galleons and stores of ammunition, some pirates worked independently; others, however, were employed by the various European crowns, particularly the British, to help carry on their power struggles in the colonial world. Puerto Rico suffered from constant attacks. The most poignant, though not typical, case involved raids against the coastal hamlet of San Germán. Two French pirate ships first ravaged the village in 1528. It happened again in 1538 and three times in the following five years. After every attack the settlers put out the fires, buried the dead, and rebuilt San Germán. In 1554, after the sixth sacking, the settlers decided to move inland to the town’s present hilltop location. With remarkable persistence the pirates climbed all the way, twice, just to pillage San Germán.<n>More ominous than the French were the forces of Sir Francis Drake. The great British navigator and adventurer operated in the Caribbean for years before he turned his attention to Puerto Rico. In 1595 Drake learned that a 2-million-peso gold shipment had just arrived in San Juan aboard a Spanish galleon. This kind of booty was worth a battle, even though Drake knew the city was well protected by a set of forts. The British fleet dueled with the guns of El Morro fort and the defending warships in a long, costly battle. Then, under cover of darkness, Drake sent out attack boats to destroy the Spanish frigates. But light from the burning ships gave El Morro’s shore batteries a fine view of their target. The English slunk away without the loot. It was the only defeat of Drake’s career; within months he was dead.<n>El Morro was not, however, invulnerable. A few years later, a British fleet commanded by George Clifford, the Earl of Cumberland, shrewdly outflanked the fortress. Far outnumbered by the 1,700-man invasion force, the defenders of El Morro surrendered after a two-week siege. But the English flag did not fly over San Juan for long. Four hundred of Cumberland’s troops died in an epidemic of yellow fever and dysentery, and the British had to withdraw less than three months after their victory. The Dutch were the next to try: in 1625, they succeeded in pinning the Spanish into the confines of El Morro; but after looting everything of value, they set fire to San Juan and departed. Because surrender was never considered, the Spanish — and today’s Puerto Ricans — regard this episode as a victory.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-History.txt
For Spain the 19th century was a bitter slide from imperial might to the status of a has-been. By the early 1800s independence movements had overthrown Spanish rule in most of the Western Hemisphere. Madrid’s most important remaining possessions were the island colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico, both of which were chafing under the yoke of colonial rule and the bitter system of slavery. To squash subversive ideas about independence in Puerto Rico, Madrid imposed ruthless military control. The most memorable incident occurred in 1868 in the mountain town of Lares, when government forces crushed an uprising of secessionists, killing or jailing the insurgents, and many innocent victims. The event is remembered as El Grito de Lares (the cry of Lares).<n>The colonial government could not, however, hold back the tide of change sweeping the Caribbean. In 1872, one momentous decree abolished the 350-year-old institution of slavery in Puerto Rico, and in 1897 Spain cut the colonial ties and finally granted the island autonomy. The long dream of independence seemed to have come true. But eight months after Madrid had authorized home rule for Puerto Rico, American troops arrived to take it away.<n>The Spanish-American War was no great challenge for the US force that landed at Guánica, on Puerto Rico’s calm south coast, rather than at fortified San Juan. Military resistance was spotty at best. By starting at the soft underbelly, the 16,000 troops of General Nelson A. Miles gained control of the island in less than three weeks. The central issue that had drawn Spain and the United States into war — Cuba’s struggle for independence — was resolved in that island’s favor: Cuba’s freedom was guaranteed by the Paris Treaty of 1898. But Spain’s two other major colonies, the Philippines and Puerto Rico, simply changed hands, becoming colonies of the United States.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-History.txt
From the caves it’s a short drive to Lares, the island’s center of coffee production. The sweet brew made from Puerto Rican beans is considered one of the finest in the world, though production is small. Coffee plants, usually interspersed with other crops such as bananas or plantains, can be seen growing on the high hillsides; it is a crop that enjoys good drainage and lots of humidity, which the large banana leaves help to conserve.<n>From Lares take Route 111 to reach the most important Amerindian site on Puerto Rico, the Parque Ceremonial Indígena Caguana (Caguana Indian Ceremonial Park). The park is set in a wide valley surrounded by limestone peaks, one of which is said to represent the supreme god of the Taínos. The several ceremonial ball courts discovered and excavated here suggest the site was one of the Indians’ major centers of worship. The Taínos were still living happily on the island when Columbus arrived in 1493; archaeological finds here date back to 1200 b.c. The ball courts, edged with stones — some with symbols carved on them — are set in fine gardens planted with many native tree species. A small museum displays pottery and other artifacts found at the site.<n>From Arecibo on the coast, it’s an hour along the fast Route 22 toll road to San Juan. Many of the villages and towns along the way are small industrial outposts for the suburbs of Cataño. Just before reaching the city, however, is a resort that is developing into an important provider of visitor accommodations. Dorado has several large resort hotels, all of which occupy private grounds near the pretty sandy beaches. These are self-contained hotels, with facilities such as golf courses and night-time entertainment. There is however, little tourist infrastructure in the immediate vicinity. The town of Dorado, with restaurants and shops, is 21⁄2 miles (4 km) from the nearest hotel along the strip. The Dorado resort area began life as a large plantation, owned by the Livingston family; the first hotel built here — the Hyatt Dorado Beach Hotel — incorporated the old plantation house into its original design.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Puerto Vallarta was launched into the international spotlight when Hollywood director John Huston decided to film the Tennessee Williams’ play, Night of the Iguana, on nearby Mismaloya Beach. Its history, however, runs much deeper than that event. Recent archeological findings show six different cultures lived in the area, with settlements dating back to 300 b.c. The most important was part of the kingdom of Xalisco, centered in the modern state of Nayarit. A marked Aztec influence is also present, probably due to the centuries-long migration of Aztecs from the legendary city of Aztlán, on the Pacific coast, to Tenochtitlan, present-day Mexico City. Remains of these cultures can be seen in the Museo del Río Cuale.<n>The first Spaniard to encounter these Nahuatl settlements was Hernán Cortez’s nephew, Francisco Cortez de Buenaventura. He arrived at the Jalisco-Nayarit coast in 1524, shortly after the fall of Tenochtitlan. He was met by “…a formidable army of 20,000 warriors, their bows decorated by myriad colored banners…” This impressive assembly earned the fertile Río Ameca Valley (just north of present day Puerto Vallarta) the name Valle de Banderas (Valley of the Banners), and the great bay just in front of the valley became known as Bahía de Banderas.<n>During colonial days the bay was visited by both Spanish galleons and pirate ships looking for shelter, repairs, or supplies. It was during this time that foreign navigators referred to the bay as Humpback Bay, or Bahía de las Jorobadas, because of the large number of humpback whales that appeared — and still appear — every winter.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-History.txt

The mines needed salt to process the ore, and an enterprising man named Guadalupe Sánchez found the perfect location for this by the mouth of the Río Cuale. He and his family became the salt suppliers for the Cuale and San Sebastián silver mines. Others arrived to take part in this lucrative trade, and in 1851 the village, called Puerto Las Peñas, was established.<n>The village grew steadily, and by 1895 construction began on the church in the town center, Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, named after the Virgin of Guadalupe, patron saint of the town. Sánchez originally founded the town on December 12th, the anniversary of the Virgin’s appearance.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-History.txt
Even though Puerto Escondido is the more mature tourist destination of the two, Huatulco has the deepest historical roots. The Aztecs and Chichimecs (a Nahuatl-speaking warrior community) knew Huatulco as an important trading port long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.<n>The name Huatulco is of Aztec origin and means “land where a tree is worshipped,” reflecting the intriguing legend of the “Santa Cruz de Huatulco” (“Sacred Cross of Huatulco”). When the Spaniards arrived at Huatulco in the late 1530s, the local Indians showed them a massive cross by the edge of the shore that they worshipped. A legend arose that the cross may have been left by an ancient saint — perhaps even the Apostle Thomas — some fifteen centuries earlier. The cross remained during the Spanish conquest and even survived an attempt to destroy it by the pirate Cavendish. In 1612 Bishop Juan de Cervantes took part of the cross to the capital city of Oaxaca and used it as the foundation of a replica, which today stands in the main altar of the cathedral. Another piece was set in silver and sent to the Vatican.<n>For centuries the bays of Huatulco basked quietly under the sun. Then, in the mid-1970s, FONATUR turned its eyes towards the southern coast of Oaxaca and started a mega-development, scheduled for completion in 2020, on the nine bays of Huatulco.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-History.txt
