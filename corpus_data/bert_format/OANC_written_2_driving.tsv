tion, order fulfillment, and transportation. [SEP] And it is in some of these areas, particularly distribution and order fulfillment, that channel dynamics have undergone substantial change during the last decade. [SEP] Supply channels are not new, of course; for centuries, fabric-makers have sold their wares to those who cut and sew garments. [SEP] But, until recently, most channels in the textile and apparel industries have been characterized by arm’s-length relationships among relatively autonomous firms. [SEP] It is only since the mid-1980s that a number of market and technological changes have encouraged companies to enhance the links among different stages of production and distribution. [SEP] Indeed, retailers like Wal-Mart Stores, Kmart Corporation, and Dillard’s Inc. have been the	driving	forces behind changes in manufacturing and logistics systems in a way that was unheard of in Bond Stores’ time. [SEP] For instance, entrepreneur Sam Walton built a retail juggernaut that began with thirty-nine Wal-Mart stores in 1971 and grew to almost three thousand by 1996. [SEP] He did so by insisting that suppliers implement information technologies for exchanging sales data, adopt standards for product labeling, and use modern methods of material handling that assured customers a variety of products at low prices. [SEP] We contend that this revolution in retailing practices will determine future competitive outcomes in retail-apparel-textile channels. [SEP] These new practices—which we call lean retailing—have compelled apparel producers to reorganize the manner in which they relate to	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2

[SEP] At the triangle’s bottom are basic products that remain in a retailer’s or manufacturer’s collection for several years, such as men’s white dress shirts or underwear. [SEP] Basics -historically constituted the majority of apparel products sold. [SEP] In the middle of the triangle are fashion-basic products, typically variants on a basic item but containing some fashion element (such as stonewashed jeans or khaki pants with pleats or trim). [SEP] This expanding center of the fashion triangle indicates where the industry is headed. [SEP] Because a growing percentage of basic apparel items have some fashion content, fashion-basic products are	driving	product proliferation. [SEP] Product proliferation and shorter product cycles, reflected in ever-changing styles and product differentiation, contribute to general demand uncertainty for both retailers and manufacturers, thereby making demand forecasting and production planning harder every day. [SEP] In a world where manufacturers must supply an increasing number of products with fashion elements, speed and flexibility are crucial capabilities for firms wrestling with product proliferation, whether they are retailers trying to offer a wide range of choices to consumers or manufacturers responding to retail demands for shipments.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2
ings have taken advantage of these new outlets—for example, producing Disney-character sheets for retail—but a new dynamic is also developing with apparel-makers, who want shorter runs of materials much more quickly from their textile suppliers. [SEP] Historically, the textile-apparel relationship involved long lead times or advance commitments to secure the necessary cloth in the right style, texture, and patterns. [SEP] This occurred not only because of the greater concentration of businesses in the textile industry, but because textile companies generally plan to run their expensive capital equipment at full capacity around the clock. [SEP] Our research indicates that the relationships between firms in the textile and apparel industries remain underdeveloped, with new competitive forces	driving	both sides to change. [SEP] Even if integration efforts in the past have been uncommon, information flows, transport, and inventory have always been decisive factors in shaping the relations among retail, apparel, and textile firms. [SEP] As Alfred Chandler and other business historians have made clear, successive changes in information exchange and transport over the last century have reshaped relations among industries, as well as the internal organization of these enterprises. [SEP] Chandler notes,	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2

[SEP] In those industries where substantial economies of scale and scope did not exist in production, high-volume flows through the processes of production and distribution came to be guided—and the resulting cost reductions achieved—by the buying departments of mass retailers, retailers who handled a variety of related products through their facilities.43 [SEP] And so we arrive at the new information technologies of the 1980s. [SEP] These have begun to create integrated channels among enterprises in the three industries, facilitating even more product proliferation and stimulating changes in merchandising, inventory management, internal production practices, and methods of using human resources. [SEP] When it comes to the	driving	force behind the late twentieth-century industrial transformation, lean retailing is at the forefront of that revolution.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2
with rules Vygotsky regarded the sociodramatic play of the preschool years as essential for further development of play—speciﬁcally, for movement toward game play in middle childhood. [SEP] In make-believe, the rules of play are implicit; preschoolers are hardly aware of enacting them. [SEP] Instead, they are caught up in creating imaginary situations—putting a stuffed animal to bed,	driving	an ambulance to a train crash, or ringing up a customer’s purchase at the cash register. [SEP] Winning and losing, team membership and competition, and purposefully laying down rules are not of great interest to preschoolers. [SEP] Try playing a rule-based game with a 3- or 4-year-old, and you are likely to ﬁnd that the child is easily sidetracked. [SEP] If, with your prompting and guidance, the child does ﬁnish the game, he or she might say, “I won!” or “Everybody won!” regardless of the outcome. [SEP] With age, the imaginativeness of play recedes. [SEP] In the games that captivate school-age children, rules come to the forefront.17 [SEP] Six- to 8-year-olds are often preoccupied with working out the rules of a game and making sure all players follow them.

Low Rider The expression “low rider” is used to describe the car, the subculture, and the person who drives a vehicle that has been lowered, rides very low, and has been customized. [SEP] A car, truck, bicycle, van, or motorcycle that has been lowered—and this can be achieved by various methods—means that it sits very close to the ground and has a sleek streamlined appearance. [SEP] The driver and/or owner is called a low rider and the act of low riding refers to all the activities associated with	driving	the car: cruising, caravanning, and hopping. [SEP] Low riders have commonly been associated with cholos (1990s urban youth) and gangs, but traditionally Chicanos seriously involved in low riding and customizing low-rider cars are not involved in gangs, and low-rider clubs actually present an alternative to gang involvement. [SEP] Low-rider car clubs communicate a message of cultural pride and unity. [SEP] Although different, the cholo subculture can be closely linked to the low-rider subculture. [SEP] It is not clear when low riding started, but it was already a custom by the 1930s in Los Angeles and Sacramento, although the name “low rider” did not come into usage until the 1960s. [SEP] After World War II, because of the growth in the economy, many Chicanos could afford to buy cars, old an	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2

[SEP] The movie Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life) depicts the work that goes into customizing a pickup truck. [SEP] Cruising involves	driving	very slowly up and down city streets, such as Mission Street in San Francisco, Whittier Boulevard in Los Angeles, and King and Story Roads in San Jose, California.

[SEP] History had forged a unique nation of people of diverse origins. [SEP] Justice Harlan understood what the nation had become and what it could do to further its own internal harmony. [SEP] His magisterial dissent leaves us with a historical record of what constitutional thought in the postbellum period could have been.

[SEP] The Court generated a surface discourse to camouflage the Secret Constitution. [SEP] It bequeathed to us a narrow conception of state action that we are still struggling to overcome. [SEP] And, more to the point, by undermining federal authority to remove the incidents and marks of slavery, the Court facilitated segregation in American society.

[SEP] We all understand that distributions of roughly , heads and , tails are far more probable macrostates than distributions with all heads or all tails. [SEP] Now consider the general argument I have made that as molecular diversity increases, the diversity of reactions increases even faster, and that there is a genuine chemical potential from the actual into the adjacent possible. [SEP] And consider again the general argument made just above that the greater the diversity of molecular species and reactions, the more likely the coupling of exergonic and endergonic reaction pairs	driving	the endergonic synthesis of new adjacent possible molecules that poise the system to advance again into the next adjacent possible. [SEP] While the detailed statistical form of these chemical reaction graphs are not yet known, they too smell of “law.” [SEP] As in the case of fair coin flips and equilibrium statistical mechanics, it is as if here again the mathematical structure compels the consequent behavior of matter and energy.

[SEP] A chemical reaction network with a work cycle will have to link spontaneous, exergonic and nonspontaneous, endergonic reactions into the chemical analogue of a work cycle. [SEP] Like the cyclic Carnot engine, the chemical analogue will have to work in a cycle of states, like the 1, 2, 3, 4, 1 cycle of the Carnot cycle. [SEP] Further, in order for the cycle to operate at a finite rate, hence irreversibly, the autonomous agent must be an open thermodynamic system driven by outside sources of matter or energy = hence “food” = and the continual	driving	of the system by such “food” holds the system away from equilibrium. [SEP] In this light, think again of the Ghadiri autocatalytic system, the 32-amino-acid sequence A that ligates two fragments A’, a 15-amino-acid fragment, and A”, a 17-amino-acid fragment, into A. This reaction is purely exergonic. [SEP] The reaction proceeds from the substrate fragments A’ and A’’ to form the product molecule A and approaches the equilibrium ratio of substrates to product. [SEP] Ghadiri’s autocatalytic system is wonderful, but merely exergonic. [SEP] It does not achieve a work cycle. [SEP] In general, autocatalytic and collectively autocatalytic systems can be purely exergonic.

[SEP] We can both be happier if we swap some of my apples for some of your pears. [SEP] It is essential to understand that, indeed, both of us can be better oV by trading. [SEP] Advantages of trade are the fundamental factor	driving	trade itself in an economy. [SEP] In an actual simple economic model, advantages of trade are studied in an “Edgeworth box.” [SEP] Edgeworth invented a two-dimensional box representation of values, or “worths,” plotted along the edge of his box (Figure 3.6).

And suppose my demon also operates the flap value to let the slower than average, hence cooler, gas particles pass from the right to the left box. Well, soon the left box will be cool and the right box will be hot. And now,” concludes Maxwell with a broad smile, “we can use the macroscopic temperature dierence between the left and right boxes to extract mechanical work, say, by	driving	a piston.” [SEP] There you have it.

pts of matter, energy, entropy, and information, we lack a coherent concept of organization, its emergence, and self-constructing propagation and self-elaboration. [SEP] If we do not yet understand organization fully, we can at least think about what happens in autonomous agents such as real cells. [SEP] A real cell, a real molecular autonomous agent, does in fact carry out self-reproduction. [SEP] In addition, it carries out one or more real work cycles, linking spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes. [SEP] It does, in fact, measure, detect, and record sources of energy and does do work to construct constraints on the release of energy, which when released in the constrained way, propagates to do more work, often constructing further constraints on the release of energy or doing work by	driving	further nonspontaneous processes. [SEP] Cells do achieve propagating work. [SEP] The work propagating in a cell achieves a “closure” in a set of propagating work tasks such that the cell literally constructs a rough copy of itself. [SEP] In a later chapter I will return to discussing “tasks,” which turn out on a Darwinian analysis to be a subset of the causal consequences of the release of energy at a point and time in the system. [SEP] For the moment, I want to focus on the concept of a closure in a set of propagating “work tasks.”	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2

[SEP] I certainly want to say yes, without attributing consciousness in any way. [SEP] Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes, metabolic switching, mechanical twitching, sensing of glucose gradient, swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations.

[SEP] But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents, it would seem, is also graced by the selfsame know-how. [SEP] If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms, they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2
I believe, and it is a matter of central importance if I am correct, that the answer is no. [SEP] I do not think it is possible to finitely prestate all the context-dependent causal consequences of parts of creatures that might turn out to be useful in some weird environment and hence be selected. [SEP] I’m not yet certain how to prove that this is not possible, although I will have a try at it below. [SEP] Another way of stating what I am	driving	at is this: Is there a finitely prestatable set of all the possible potential biological functions? [SEP] Again, I think the answer is no. [SEP] Yet another way of stating this is to say that there is no finite prestatement of the configuration space of a biosphere.

of the actual exist. [SEP] Those in the adjacent possible do not exist  at least within the volume of the universe we are talking about, which we can expand in a moment to be the actual molecular diversity of the entire universe, not just our tiny patch of it. [SEP] The chemical potential of a single reaction with a single set of substrates and no products is perfectly definable, both the enthalpy and entropy. [SEP] But we hardly need that sophistication. [SEP] The substrates are present in the actual, and the products are not present in the actual, but only in the adjacent possible. [SEP] It follows that every such reaction couple is displaced from its equilibrium in the direction of an excess of substrates compared to its products. [SEP] This displacement constitutes a chemical potential	driving	the reaction toward equilibrium. [SEP] The simple conclusion is that there is a real chemical potential from the actual to the adjacent possible. [SEP] Other things being equal, the total system “wants” to flow into the adjacent possible. [SEP] If there are to trillion organic molecules in the biosphere and each pair of organic molecules can undergo at least one two substrate–two product reaction, then the diversity of reactions is the square of the diversity of molecular species, hence about x = . [SEP] Some substantial fraction of these reactions flow from the actual to the adjacent possible. [SEP] The total chemical potential from the actual into the adjacent possible is hard to estimate, but it is certainly not small.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2
ther, perhaps generic, property that appears to drive such systems to settle down, then change in a sudden burst. [SEP] As the system of agents and actions settles down to some repeatable behavior, an increasingly wide range of alternative theories, simple and very complex, fit the same data. [SEP] But the complex theories, with many Fourier modes, attempt to predict fine details of the repeatable behavior. [SEP] As those theories become more complex, they are more fragile because they can be disconfirmed by ever more minor fluctuations in the repeatable behavior. [SEP] Sooner or later such a fluctuation happens, and the agents with the complex disconfirmed theories change theories and actions radically, setting up a vast avalanche of changes of theories and actions that sweeps the system,	driving	the collective behavior far from any repeatable pattern. [SEP] In these new circumstances, only a small subset of theories fits the current facts, so the diversity, and complexity, of theories in the population of agents plummets, and the system finds its way back to some repeatable pattern of behavior. [SEP] In short, there appears to be not only a bounded complexity in our rationality, but a fragility - stability cyclic oscillation in our joint theories and actions as well. [SEP] In these terms, the system of agents and theories never settles down to a fixed-point equilibrium in which markets clear.

[SEP] If there are N objects, the number of potential complement or substitute relations scales at least as N squared since each object might be a complement or substitute of any object. [SEP] Thus, as the diversity of the objects in the web increases, the diversity of prospective niches for new goods and services increases even more rapidly! [SEP] The very diversity of the economic web is autocatalytic. [SEP] If this view is correct, then diversity of goods and services is a major driver of economic growth. [SEP] Indeed, I believe that the role of diversity of goods and services is the major unrecognized factor	driving	economic growth. [SEP] Jane Jacobs had made the same point in her thoughtful books about the relation between economic growth and economic diversity of cities and their hinterlands. [SEP] Economist Jose Scheinkman, now chairman of economics at the University of Chicago, and his colleagues studied a number of cities, normalized for total capitalization, and found that economic growth correlated with economic diversity in the city. [SEP] In a similar spirit, microfinancing of a linked diversity of cottage businesses in the third world and the first world seems to be achieving local economic growth where more massive eorts at education and infrastructure, Aswan dams and power grids, seem to fail.

[SEP] Tiburon is the quieter of the two, while Sausalito is more of a tourist trap, but both have a colorful Mediterranean atmosphere, with art galleries, yacht harbors, craft shops, and pleasant bistros and cafés out on the boardwalk overlooking the bay.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2
Accommodatingly situated on the border between Ontario and Québec, Ottawa is a fully bilingual city, though most of the French-speaking community (and the best restaurants) now have their homes in Hull on the Québec side of the Ottawa River. [SEP] Except for longer excursions, try to leave the car in the hotel parking lot and walk or take the bus. [SEP] The complex system of one-way streets designed to avoid rather than to reach key government buildings, and the added confusion of curving rivers and canals, make downtown	driving	a harrowing business even for locals. [SEP] One other point: In the absence of any clear logic in street numbering, it’s important when noting an address to be sure you have the nearest cross-streets as well as the number of the building.

Highway 4 follows the lake shore to Cathedral Grove, a formidable stand of Douglas firs in MacMillan Provincial Park, donated to the public by a paper manufacturer as a gesture for government permission to exploit less accessible parts of the forest. [SEP] Many of the firs, up to 76 m (230 ft) high, are more than 300 years old, the most ancient dating back to the 12th century. [SEP] Excellent explanatory panels trace the growth of these majestic trees. [SEP] Off the beaten track, you’ll steep yourself in the atmosphere of a truly primeval forest. [SEP] Stock up on picnic supplies in the town of Port Alberni before	driving	on past Kennedy Lake and down to Pacific Rim National Park. [SEP] Its sandy beaches are a delight, the powerful ocean-breakers being particularly admired by champion surfers. [SEP] At the coast, Highway 4 turns north along one of the best resort areas, the self-explanatory Long Beach, 12 km (7 miles) of fine sand and first-class fishing waters. [SEP] Hotels here provide you with cooking facilities for whatever fish you — or a generous neighbor — might catch. [SEP] The boardwalk that rambles along Wickaninnish Bay will take you in and out of the coastal pine forest. [SEP] Florencia Bay is a good bathing beach, while South Bay is the mecca for collectors of “worry stones.” [SEP] These exquisite green, aubergine, or (most prized of all) jet black pebbles are gathered from hidden nooks and cran	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2
r, there is the unusually dense growth of trees and fauna in what is the Parque Nacional Garajonay (open Tuesday–Sunday 9:30am–4:30pm). [SEP] Less than 20 km (121⁄2 miles) from north to south, this amazing island has been declared a Property of Humanity by UNESCO. [SEP] In fact, a third of the island, 12,450 hectares (30,774 acres) has been designated into seventeen protected areas. [SEP] Such terrain, though, makes for difficulty in getting around, and even the Romans, had they ventured this way, would have found their legendary ability to build straight roads put to an impossible test. [SEP] In fact, almost nowhere on the island will you find a straight stretch of road, everywhere you go the roads twist and turn continually, often turning back on themselves in hairpin bends. [SEP] Making	driving	even more complicated is the fact that the roads, although improving, are often of poor quality, and the directional signs leave much to be desired. [SEP] Just 40 minutes away from Tenerife, La Gomera nevertheless remains unspoiled and authentic, with its steep, green, terraced hills and tranquil valleys.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2
Ronda The opening of an improved road from San Pedro de Alcántara to Ronda has ended the isolation of this mountain area, and shortened the	driving	time from the coast to an hour. [SEP] One of the most spectacularly situated towns in Europe, Ronda sits atop a cliff-bound plateau, cleaved through the middle by a sheer-sided gorge. [SEP] The older, Moorish part of town (La Ciudad) lies to the south of the ravine, linked by an 18th-century bridge to El Mercadillo, the modern district that arose after the Reconquista. [SEP] The gorge, known as El Tajo, is a deep and narrow crevasse that plunges 150 m (490 ft) to the foaming Río Guadalevín, a tributary of the Guadiaro River. [SEP] During the Civil War, nationalist sympathizers in the town were hurled to their deaths in the gorge, an event recalled by Hemingway in his novel For Whom the Bell Tolls. [SEP] You can enjoy a superb view of the Tajo and the patchwork of fields beyond from the Puen	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2
There are beaches and excellent diving farther west, near Playa María la Gorda, but for most visitors the star attractions are the irresistible town of Viñales and its beautiful valley. [SEP] Many visitors take organized daytrips of the region from Havana hotels, but an overnight stay in Viñales — overlooking the valley — is highly recommended. [SEP] Start your explorations by	driving	west on the autopista (highway) linking Havana with the province’s capital city of Pinar del Río. [SEP] About 63 km (39 miles) along the highway, a turnoff leaves the level, palm-dotted plains for Soroa, where a richly endowed botanical garden nestles in the mountain foothills near a tired little tourist complex. [SEP] A guided tour reveals an orchid garden, lychee and mango trees, coffee plants, and splendid specimens of jagüey and ceiba trees. [SEP] A restaurant in the villa of Castillo de las Nubes on a nearby mountain has stunning views. [SEP] At the end of the highway, 175 km (109 miles) west of Havana, the small city of Pinar del Río is a bustling commercial center. [SEP] Along the main street, Calle José Martí, low-rise neoclassical buildings in blues, yellows, greens, and orange hav	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2
Upriver from the sandbank at its mouth, the Douro runs between Porto and the port lodges of Vila Nova de Gaia, passing beneath a series of impressive bridges and on towards port-wine territory. [SEP] The railway line from Porto skips the first 60 km (37 miles) of the river — but this is the least interesting stretch. [SEP] The line eventually joins the river near Ribadouro, proceeding along the northern bank, past small towns and fields where the haystacks, set on cross-shaped supports, look from a distance like scarecrows. [SEP] Attractive Amarante sits on a gorge of the Tâmega (a tributary of the Douro) and makes a good stop if you are	driving	along the road from Porto towards Mesã Frio and Régua. [SEP] Baronial mansions with gaily painted balconies overlooking the river line the streets. [SEP] Rising above a handsome stone arched bridge and leafy park, the church of the former 16th-century monastery of São Gonçalo is well worth a visit, especially if you are looking for love: It hosts a pilgrimage in June for women seeking husbands (with the exchange of phallic-shaped cakes—a remarkably literal step in the mating dance). [SEP] The river bends and twists, widens and narrows among green terraced hills. [SEP] The port trade prompted the growth of Peso da Régua (usually called just Régua), 70 km (43 miles) east of Porto. [SEP] Régua was once the main port used to ship young wines downriver in barcos rabelos (flat-bottomed wooden boa	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	2
