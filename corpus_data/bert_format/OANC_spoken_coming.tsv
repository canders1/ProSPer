Then they went on, they didn't make it to the house. [SEP] At about, about three weeks later, then arrived a group of about four, at my brother's house, and told him, that they were	coming	to, to be, that is to take control of the place, where we lived. [SEP] Well, but that they weren't going to steal, they weren't going to kill, neither would they harm the people, but it we didn't, if we worked with them.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I said, "No, I'm not going to tell them." [SEP] So, the next day, I left early in the morning for San Miguel, to see my daughter, and when I was	coming	back, I went by my brother's, which was a place in, a town called Chapeltique, and I arrived at his place, and I said, his name is Salomon, and I said, "Brother, I am here to see if you'll give me posada (lodging)," we call it, like you give someone a place to live in your own house. [SEP] And he said, "What's going on?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Now we, now we didn't, we didn't pay attention to the kids, we had forgotten about the kids, we were going to attend to my brother. [SEP] But, a car was	coming	by with a white flag that meant "peace" and in that car there was a friend of Luis Alonso's and also a guerrilla came in that car. [SEP] And, so they came in through the interior door there, they turned like this, and came in through the door, and, and they knocked.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

Yeah. [SEP] So after two or three days he called Callgrove and said, "Don't bother	coming	in I found a guy better than you." [SEP] Well when Callgrove found out it was me that, that kind of hurt his feelings a little you know, but ever since then Pop and I worked all summers, every summer, we did the Kavalo job, then we built a barn the following year for the Reamuses down on the river.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

Oh yeah, it was like $1600.00 worth of damage to my van because of Hurricane Hugo. [SEP] And then when uh, I ended up staying at Coke like sixteen hours that day because, you know, the roads were shut down and nobody was	coming	in.

[SEP] OK, we uh, went to sleep and uh, about an hour and a half later about 8:00 in the morning uh, Craig's mom comes in to wake us up and says there's two guys that want to see us at the front door.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

Oh, yeah. [SEP] I can remember my, uh, my father telling me, um, the story of my grandparents	coming	from, uh, Italy when, uh, they came over. [SEP] Um, so that kind of stands clearly in my mind.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
You had the things that they would read out of books, which were purely for entertainment, it always seemed like. [SEP] Um, and then if it was anything that was, you know, that I kind of correlated with, if it wasn't	coming	from a book, they were probably trying to get something into my head. [SEP] You know, trying to like, you know, teach me something in some way.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
You know, trying to like, you know, teach me something in some way. [SEP] So it was kind of like if it was	coming	out of book, I knew it was for pure entertainment, whereas if it was something they were telling to me, I might be a little more receptive to, you know, maybe trying to find a little, a little meaning behind it and say, " Hey, why are you, why are you telling me this?" [SEP] Now, your grandparents or great-grandparents came from Italy?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, yeah, I mean they just, they mostly, they didn't really talk about what it was like being over there. [SEP] I mean, they more talked about, um,	coming	over here.

Well I get there this morning and um, I forget how, I think either I asked a question and he came in there or, whatever. [SEP] Anyhow, he tells me, "Well I need it by today because such and such is	coming	,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
But I was like, forget it, I'm going to eat lunch I was hungry. [SEP] Usually you feel like you have to work through, like you just have to keep working because he needs it even though it wasn't your fault that he gave it to you at the very last minute, you know, I was like ( ), and then Lana calls me in the kitchen telling me Ramona had gotten here and I didn't even know she was	coming	for sure. [SEP] This time I wasn't even happy that she was there because I was so stressed out.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I spoke to him twice that day and it was like. [SEP] So anyway, um, he ended up	coming	in there and he was like, "How's it	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And so she sat back down, and, you know, they were still chatting, and they could still see this person, and this person was walking really, really fast. [SEP] And she said that her brother had this really distinctive walk and she said the more she looked at that person	coming	down that road she started thinking "No, that can't be, that can't be." [SEP] And she said, but you know, the closer he got, she said she got up, and she peered down the road and she looked at her mom, and she said, she said, "Mama, you know, I think that's Joe."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So Granny got up, and she kind of walked down the steps off the porch and she was walking up towards the road and she then just stood there. [SEP] And then he was	coming	, she said he was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

And they moved to Mallard Creek in Charlotte.

Why I remember it so is that I was the individual that put Mr.Weeks in the aircraft and, and sent him out on his mission and made a successful mission.

The most traumatic thing, my daddy decided to build a house when I was in the 10th grade so, and he literally built the house, and when we moved into it there was no sheet rock on the inside and the plumbing wasn't hooked up yet. [SEP] So we had a garden hose	coming	in through the kitchen window for our water in the sink in the kitchen. [SEP] We had one toilet in the house that was flushable but since there wasn't any sheet rock around the bathroom we hung these big army blankets to the studs, nailed those to the studs for privacy.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

But it was sad when she started to lose her memory because she would pull up plants out of season.

And because it was slanted, you'd slide on it a little bit and about 15 steps into it we looked at each other.

He said it was the only thing he could think of to keep everybody from crying and screaming and not just absolutely petrified of this storm, um, and I remember one other time when I was little, um, my dad, as I said earlier, my dad traveled a lot with his job, and, um, there were also times when he had to travel out of the country. [SEP] And, um, when I was very young, um, you know, he would be gone maybe, you know, a month or two and then be home two or three months and then be gone again, you know, and so each time, you know, he came home there was a period of a few days or even a week or so that was a real adjustment period for me, you know, because he'd been gone and then	coming	back.

[SEP] Um, and you look at other kinds of things and I think Charlotte, and maybe it's typical of the South, but I think that, uh, maybe there hasn't been as much growth here before and when you have growth and you have people	coming	in, who, looking for services. [SEP] And you, and you also have a, a government, um, who are, are really ready to take that challenge as opposed to just deciding that, "Hey, listen we're gonna do things the way we've done it for the last, you know, 100 years, whether new people come or need services or ask for amenities or not, we're going to keep things the way they are."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Went in, and, uh, it always, mother had always talked about the staircase and how beautiful it was, and indeed it probably had been.
