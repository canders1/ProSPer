(The following discussion occurred in chambers:) [SEP] Let's	go	on the record. [SEP] We are in chambers, and this is the matter of Kitzmiller, of course, versus Dover Area School	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	1

I didn't say this strictly in the opinion, perhaps, but my opinion was not meant to allow the testimony of the reporters to	go	in any way, in particular, outside the four corners of the affidavits	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	1
But I'll tell you that if it's their persistent position that they don't want to testify, then we'll	go	on the record -- now, I'm not	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	1

Benn, I think, fears that even this would do that. [SEP] I don't share that fear. [SEP] But to	go	any further than that would mean that a reporter's veracity could be questioned each and every time something	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	1

Do you recall a young man by the name of Max Pell speaking at that meeting? [SEP] Unfortunately I was in the restroom at the time that Max Pell was speaking because -- my husband told you I was eight months pregnant. I was actually nine months pregnant and due any day, so I spent quite a deal of time in the restroom. But I had excused myself to	go	to the restroom just after Barrie did this whole thing. In fact, I may have been walking out of the room at the time and in close proximity to her. And so at the time when Max was speaking -- I believe that there were people who spoke in between she and Max Pell. [SEP] But at the time when he stood to speak, I was in the restroom and sort of coming back from the restroom, so I don't really recall exactly what his comments were. [SEP] I know him because he was my husband's student, though. [SEP] Do you recall any other board members saying anything during the course of any discussion about the biology textbook?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	1
Do you recall any other board members saying anything during the course of any discussion about the biology textbook? [SEP] Well, like I said, I was reentering the room from the bathroom, so I was sort of in the doorway. [SEP] And I obviously didn't know what Max had said to the board but that he had spoken to the board. [SEP] So the comments that were coming back were, I assume, directed at him. [SEP] But there were comments from Bill Buckingham about brainwashing, and I remember hearing that, the whole thing about brainwashing, because it dealt with	go	ing to college and getting this education and students who	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	1
And can you please tell us how you have been harmed? [SEP] Well, in numerous ways. [SEP] First, as a teacher, professionally, I feel that teachers in general are harmed, myself, as well, because there's a dichotomy here in what they're saying about this statement that they have passed on intelligent design as they're not teaching it. [SEP] On the other hand, they've said that it enhances state standards and critical thinking. [SEP] In my mind, everything that you do in a classroom is teaching. [SEP] And I don't necessarily think that's just in my mind. [SEP] I believe that's true of all educators. [SEP] The way I dress when I	go	to work tells my students something. [SEP] The statements I make or the statements that I do not make in my classroom tell my students something. [SEP] So I think we're charged with, you know, having an ethical decision to make when we walk into the classroom, the things that we say and the things that we do, and so I think that's very important. [SEP] But you can't say when you walk into a classroom, you're not teaching. [SEP] And if that's what's happening in the Dover school system and my children are in that school system, that they're routinely establishing practices that is not teaching in the classroom, then that's shameful. [SEP] In addition, I have a child who is in the ninth-grade biology class, and this has spilled over into other classes. [SEP] It's not just the biology class th	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	1
Is it your understanding that it presents Darwin's theory of evolution in a manner that is consistent with its standing in the scientific community? [SEP] As much as I know about the scientific community -- and, you know, you have to remember that's not my discipline. But as much as I know about what the high school science standards say, it would be in standing with that. As far as the scientific community, I really can't	go	there, because I know that there is a lot more about Darwin than is in that textbook. I mean, I can absolutely say that without knowing everything about Darwin or knowing everything about science. Do you have any reason to believe that what's in the biology book is inconsistent with what the scientific community --	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	1
You never checked? [SEP] There were a couple instances where friends of mine had tried to check on the status of the books in the library but were not permitted to	go	in at that time. [SEP] So I am only assuming that those books are there now because I am being told that they are. [SEP] But as for myself walking into a library and seeing them there, I did not. [SEP] Do you have any objection to these additional books being placed in the library?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	1

So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you, um, wouldn't know what had taken place. [SEP] So we would	go	every Saturday morning.

[SEP] That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs.

[SEP] What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges? [SEP] And the answer is, no, I will not have a litmus test.

I've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith to the American people in the way that he took this nation to war. [SEP] He said he would work through a real alliance. [SEP] He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution. [SEP] Well, we didn't. [SEP] And the result is our forces today are overextended. [SEP] The fact is that he did not choose to	go	to war as a last result. [SEP] And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we're finished and much more probably.

[SEP] And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban. [SEP] They don't want to	go	into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47. [SEP] I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, "See the house over?

I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, "See the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. " Because of the president's decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous. [SEP] Terrorists can now come into America and	go	to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today.
