He said, "Yes, you know," he said, "You can count on them, and me, too, if, if you need me."<n>I said, "Look, I need them to, over there, about five, six in the morning, five- thirty, because I'm leaving here," I said, "and I want them to take the most important things to town for me," because, since from, from my place to town was about two hours, on the road, walking, then, because no cars came through.<n>So he said, "OK, that's fine."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
And he left, and that's how it was.<n>When he came back, he said, "Yes," so, he said, "I'm going to leave here," he said, "from your house for Chapeltique at four in the morning with the livestock."<n>And that's how it was, he left, at dawn, and he said, "See you there," and he left with the, with the livestock, with the, and the, the others who were going to help.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt

she said, "so I'm going."<n>So, I came in, from where I was washing, I went in, and I didn't see what the guerrillas did with themselves, because I didn't see, they were in front, but since I went it, I didn't see.<n>Then, you know, that in order to keep yourself out of trouble, you go in and don't, then they come, or, that was another time, that I suffered a terrible threat when the soldiers come through.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt

In, uh, in the window in front, we have a window facing the street, there was a guerrilla lying on the ground, firing at the soldiers.<n>On this other side where the bedroom was, I went outside, and I saw him, well, the size of the flame, when the flame from the rif, from, the bullet came out, even with a small flame like this<n>.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt

We had one toilet in the house that was flushable but since there wasn't any sheet rock around the bathroom we hung these big army blankets to the studs, nailed those to the studs for privacy.<n>And all my aunts and uncles and cousins came up to help move in and work on the house.<n>So we had a weekend when it was like 12 of us staying there with one toilet, the hose going in through the kitchen<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt
And, oh I don't know how many, I don't just want to estimate four or five young couples would ring the doorbell and ask if we had a room to rent and we would, Ma or Dad would, say no.<n>And finally this one couple named Ed and Sally Duffind, who came from Erie, PA, and they knocked on the door and he was a lieutenant in the infantry and headed for Germany.<n>And they said, "Well, if you would just let us uh, uh stay in your garage," and my dad answered and said, "Well, it has a dirt floor."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
And, uh, he did go off to war and did come back and many years after that nearly every year they would come down to see us in Columbus from Erie.<n>In fact, when he came back, one time he gave me a beautiful large pearl, perfect pearl and years and years later, when my father died in 1978, I had, took some of the money that I got from his inheritance and, uh, bought a heart and placed that pearl in the center of the heart and now wear it; one of my treasured possessions.<n>That's just kind of a little aside from the war days.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
At any rate he would come to Warm Springs and he'd come through Columbus.<n>And at the time one day I was, mother and I came out of the doctor's office.<n>We rode the bus because we only had one car in our family.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
And I'll let you figure up how long that took to save $50.<n>But back again to the war years one time we came out of the doctor's office and I was just standing on the corner and along came Roosevelt's famous car with no roof on it no top on it.<n>Uh, well he was driving.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt

Kevin!"<n>you know, came up to me and was like uh, "Oh crap," you know<n>.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt
So he raced back to the house to get my mom and get the car.<n>Well, they came and got me and took me back to the house, and my mom, I, I was shaking and stuff, my mom was afraid I was going in shock, so she put a blanket around me, and she was like, "Kevin are you OK?"<n>and I was like, "Yeah I'm OK Mom.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt
Um, not really.<n>Um, but when I left fifth grade, I also left Brooklyn, and when I came to the VA school system things were very different.<n>Actually, um, there was a sense in which I think I was a little bit ahead of where folks were, um, in VA at that time.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
And, um, I think more than my teacher, she really, I guess you would say, inspired me to, uh, cultivate it and express myself more so in that, that way.<n>So your, your writing first came about in high school.<n>Umm, no.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
Um, it was, it was, just, um, more of my, you know, how the teenagers go through, uh, "Trying to find myself", a questioning period?<n>And that was one of the poems that came out of my, "Who Am I?<n>What am I doing here?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
I looked at it and couldn't believe that it was in her house!<n>And I went to her and I was expressing my concern to her, and, um, of course, that "you don't throw away a book" came up, "But Gran!<n>Some books you just have to throw away!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
To my recollection, I think all but one of my siblings is very strong in the area of reading.<n>And that one sibling is, she came up at a time when they switched from phonics to sight-reading--<n>Yes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
.<n>I grew up on a 100-acre farm, which is hard to believe, now near the airport, which was not nearly as intrusive as it is now, because this was backing up to my father's parent's, who came down here from Wisconsin in 1937, looking for a Southern way of life, to get away from all that snow.<n>They bought this farm off of Wilmont Road, I think it's still Wilmont Road, anyhow it's near the new Coliseum on Tyvola<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
Um.<n>My father and mother met, shortly thereafter, and married in 1930, May of 1938, I think, because I came along two years later, and grew up with my grandmother Tina there, to kind of, well, I remember when I was about five years old and we had settled down for the long haul on the farm after my father finished traveling around and taking us with him to various uh, Air Force assignments out in Texas and, oh, Myrtle Beach.<n>He was in the Reserves.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
During these years we raised Angus cattle and ate very well, with vegetables from the garden, but we didn't have any money.<n>So my other grandmother came to live with us to take care of the children, and my mother and father both found jobs in town.<n>And the two grandmothers had nothing in common but each one really gave me quite a gift.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
And she was so sweet to me.<n>The other grandmother probably had an eighth-grade education but a fabulous mind for invention because she came up with these stories.<n>When I was about seven, my mother was pregnant with my little sister, they sent me to live in Chapel Hill for six weeks toward the end of her pregnancy.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
but for a child it was very comforting.<n>And then she came to live with us probably four or five years more later, while I was in the eighth grade so it would have been eight years later, and she loved gardening and flowers.<n>And I think I got some of that from her because I still, whenever I'm out in the yard gardening I think about Granny, my mother's mother.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
She was Kathryn Petric Borden - Petric was short for Petrechek.<n>She was from Czecho, her parents were from Czechoslovakia, and that was her maiden name, but it was shortened to Petric when they came over here.<n>So she was Kathryn Petric Borden, and so my mother had no choice in the matter - I had to be Kathryn.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
That Anne and I split up when she died.<n>She didn't specify who would get what, and when she died and the time came to settle up stuff, Mom said, "Ok, how are you and Anne going to do this?"<n>And so we said, "We'll flip a coin and see who goes first."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
From Kathryn--<n>My mother came up with that nickname.<n>It has nothing to do with her name.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
.<n>I asked my mother how she came up with it, and she said she didn't know, it just kind of fit her, and so from then on she was Tina.<n>Hum.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
Whereas my other grandmother, who used snuff, and was very, very religious to the point of being a fanatic, uh, was a perfect granny.<n>My mother made her cotton dresses that came down below her calf, and she wore these shoes that are now in vogue, the black--<n>The granny shoes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
And he didn't come back, which left her mother kind of in limbo.<n>They presumed dead, the war ended, he never came back, they never learned what happened to him, and so she took up with this, I guess he was a traveling salesman, with a wagon and a mule.<n>And she put her two children, Maryann and her little brother, Maryann was about 12 and her brother was about eight at this point, and they took, they moved down, or were going to move down to Georgia.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
So they brought her some sort of herbal concoction and broke her fever and she got better and they went away.<n>And they came back the next Monday, after the baking was done, and they gathered up the four corners of the tablecloth and took the week's worth of baking, out the door, which they figured was their due<n>.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
.<n>So anyway, along we came into this big cavern and there were these big dolls and bright colors and trains just kind of lurching through this, this water.<n>It was really cool actually and I don't remember when it started because all of us were kind of looking around but somebody said, "Look at Melissa!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt
He got tired and I thought I'd go a little farther and I skied a few more steps and somehow one of us had dislodged a fairly good size rock, which I had no idea was bouncing down the hill toward me.<n>And I'm skiing away having a great time and once when I came up, I remember, I can still remember I came up in mid air and I was as high up off the shale as you could get making my next turn, and "Wham!"<n>this rock smacks right into my hip.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt
It's a metamorphic rock, so it's made out of mud and it sort of gets created by the pressure of the water over thousands of years, so it's really kind of a loose kind of rock, and the shale, that huge shale that we were skiing over had broken off up above on the shale crest and sort of collected.<n>And so we were skiing in big piles of loose rock, was what it came down to.<n>That's crazy.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt

He said it was the only thing he could think of to keep everybody from crying and screaming and not just absolutely petrified of this storm, um, and I remember one other time when I was little, um, my dad, as I said earlier, my dad traveled a lot with his job, and, um, there were also times when he had to travel out of the country.<n>And, um, when I was very young, um, you know, he would be gone maybe, you know, a month or two and then be home two or three months and then be gone again, you know, and so each time, you know, he came home there was a period of a few days or even a week or so that was a real adjustment period for me, you know, because he'd been gone and then coming back.<n>And so, I sort of had to, you know, build my trust with him again, you know, each time.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt
