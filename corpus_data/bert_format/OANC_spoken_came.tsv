We had one toilet in the house that was flushable but since there wasn't any sheet rock around the bathroom we hung these big army blankets to the studs, nailed those to the studs for privacy. [SEP] And all my aunts and uncles and cousins	came	up to help move in and work on the house. [SEP] So we had a weekend when it was like 12 of us staying there with one toilet, the hose going in through the kitchen	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And, oh I don't know how many, I don't just want to estimate four or five young couples would ring the doorbell and ask if we had a room to rent and we would, Ma or Dad would, say no. [SEP] And finally this one couple named Ed and Sally Duffind, who	came	from Erie, PA, and they knocked on the door and he was a lieutenant in the infantry and headed for Germany. [SEP] And they said, "Well, if you would just let us uh, uh stay in your garage," and my dad answered and said, "Well, it has a dirt floor."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And, uh, he did go off to war and did come back and many years after that nearly every year they would come down to see us in Columbus from Erie. [SEP] In fact, when he	came	back, one time he gave me a beautiful large pearl, perfect pearl and years and years later, when my father died in 1978, I had, took some of the money that I got from his inheritance and, uh, bought a heart and placed that pearl in the center of the heart and now wear it; one of my treasured possessions. [SEP] That's just kind of a little aside from the war days.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
At any rate he would come to Warm Springs and he'd come through Columbus. [SEP] And at the time one day I was, mother and I	came	out of the doctor's office. [SEP] We rode the bus because we only had one car in our family.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

I had a small child had a two and-a-half year old and a baby.

So uh , I passed my dad, I passed him, and about that time my brakes, I don't know what happened, my front brakes got, went in the spokes somehow and it, it made me uh, it flipped me in the air about one and a half times, and I got, we had toe clips on our bikes and finally, finally my feet	came	out of my toe clips and my chin hit the pavement and-- Were you near your house?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

So he raced back to the house to get my mom and get the car. [SEP] Well, they	came	and got me and took me back to the house, and my mom, I, I was shaking and stuff, my mom was afraid I was going in shock, so she put a blanket around me, and she was like, "Kevin are you OK?" and I was like, "Yeah I'm OK Mom.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Um, not really. [SEP] Um, but when I left fifth grade, I also left Brooklyn, and when I	came	to the VA school system things were very different.

. I grew up on a 100-acre farm, which is hard to believe, now near the airport, which was not nearly as intrusive as it is now, because this was backing up to my father's parent's, who	came	down here from Wisconsin in 1937, looking for a Southern way of life, to get away from all that snow. They bought this farm off of Wilmont Road, I think it's still Wilmont Road, anyhow it's near the new Coliseum on Tyvola	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Um. [SEP] My father and mother met, shortly thereafter, and married in 1930, May of 1938, I think, because I	came	along two years later, and grew up with my grandmother Tina there, to kind of, well, I remember when I was about five years old and we had settled down for the long haul on the farm after my father finished traveling around and taking us with him to various uh, Air Force assignments out in Texas and, oh, Myrtle Beach. [SEP] He was in the Reserves.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
During these years we raised Angus cattle and ate very well, with vegetables from the garden, but we didn't have any money. [SEP] So my other grandmother	came	to live with us to take care of the children, and my mother and father both found jobs in town. [SEP] And the two grandmothers had nothing in common but each one really gave me quite a gift.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And she was so sweet to me. [SEP] The other grandmother probably had an eighth-grade education but a fabulous mind for invention because she	came	up with these stories. [SEP] When I was about seven, my mother was pregnant with my little sister, they sent me to live in Chapel Hill for six weeks toward the end of her pregnancy.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
but for a child it was very comforting. [SEP] And then she	came	to live with us probably four or five years more later, while I was in the eighth grade so it would have been eight years later, and she loved gardening and flowers. [SEP] And I think I got some of that from her because I still, whenever I'm out in the yard gardening I think about Granny, my mother's mother.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
She was Kathryn Petric Borden - Petric was short for Petrechek. [SEP] She was from Czecho, her parents were from Czechoslovakia, and that was her maiden name, but it was shortened to Petric when they	came	over here. [SEP] So she was Kathryn Petric Borden, and so my mother had no choice in the matter - I had to be Kathryn.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
That Anne and I split up when she died. [SEP] She didn't specify who would get what, and when she died and the time	came	to settle up stuff, Mom said, "Ok, how are you and Anne going to do this?" [SEP] And so we said, "We'll flip a coin and see who goes first."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

Whereas my other grandmother, who used snuff, and was very, very religious to the point of being a fanatic, uh, was a perfect granny.

And he didn't come back, which left her mother kind of in limbo. [SEP] They presumed dead, the war ended, he never	came	back, they never learned what happened to him, and so she took up with this, I guess he was a traveling salesman, with a wagon and a mule. [SEP] And she put her two children, Maryann and her little brother, Maryann was about 12 and her brother was about eight at this point, and they took, they moved down, or were going to move down to Georgia.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So they brought her some sort of herbal concoction and broke her fever and she got better and they went away.

It's a metamorphic rock, so it's made out of mud and it sort of gets created by the pressure of the water over thousands of years, so it's really kind of a loose kind of rock, and the shale, that huge shale that we were skiing over had broken off up above on the shale crest and sort of collected.

[SEP] And, um, when I was very young, um, you know, he would be gone maybe, you know, a month or two and then be home two or three months and then be gone again, you know, and so each time, you know, he	came	home there was a period of a few days or even a week or so that was a real adjustment period for me, you know, because he'd been gone and then coming back.

and it was just i mean an absolute uh unforseen unforseen unforeseen thing that a woman should become president in this good ole boy city okay don't misunderstand me now but it it all	came	down to the fact that you had to be able to deal i mean we had uh our board our officers and our board board of directors of about twenty people now this is a good size group of people to manage and to come to one voice on on certain things you understand	#telephone#	telephone_sw4895-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
and to come to one voice on on certain things you understand and in my year we did perfectly fine and the the gentlemen that	came	behind me was a uh wonderful intelligent smooth really good looking successful young black man but he had his own agenda and wouldn't compromise with people he thought that because he was president he could drive through whatever he chose	#telephone#	telephone_sw4895-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
