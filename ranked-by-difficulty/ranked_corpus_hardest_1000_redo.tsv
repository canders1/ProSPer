Population: 666,000 Tenerife is not only the largest of the Canaries geographically, it also offers the tourist more sights, more attractions, more towns and cities to explore, and more contrasts than any of the other islands. Where else can you look around a banana plantation and then take a short	drive	half-way up a mountain for a snowball fight? Tenerife has been welcoming visitors from cold northern climes since the 19th century. However, the focus has changed from the cloudy, green north coast where Puerto de la Cruz was once the favorite resort (it is still enormously popular), to the hot, dry, arid south.	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt	1	43055	9	0.22602952725215542	bert_base_bert_large_distilbert_gpt2_base_gpt2_large_gpt2_med_gpt2_xl_gpt_txl

From Kathmandu, short trips to the valley rim make it possible for those with limited time to see the high mountains at sunrise or sunset. Nagarkot, which stands on the crest of a ridge at 2,195 m (7,200 ft), is about an hour’s drive from Bhaktapur and one of the best places in the Kathmandu area for viewing the Himalayas. From this aerie on the rim of the Kathmandu Valley, 322 km (200 miles) of the Himalayas stretch out before you in an immense wall of rock and ice. Although there are excellent views from the many lodges and hotels here, the view is even better from a nearby observation tower, which can be reached in about an hour’s	walk	from Nagarkot. From this observation tower, it is possible to see as far as Mount Everest. Most visitors come for the sunrise or sunset on the mountains, and though the weather is often at its clearest in the early morning, low clouds and fog often obstruct the view. The Kathmandu area’s other popular mountain-viewing spot is the village of Dhulikhel, which has a view very similar to that from Nagarkot and is a bit easier to reach, since it is on the main highway to Tibet. This highway passes through Banepa, where you can turn off to visit Panauti. The buildings here have great artistic and historic importance and for this reason have become the focus of a French-funded restoration project. Today, this out-of-the-way village offers a fascinating glimpse into the Kathmandu Valley’s small-tow	walk	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	1	45219	9	0.4392177573518824	gpt2_base_gpt2_large_gpt2_med_gpt2_xl_roberta_txl_bert_base_bert_large_distilbert

The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word	arrived	of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to "engage or "take out" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: "I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out."	arrive	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt	3	40556	8	0.1821345021802219	gpt2_base_gpt2_large_gpt2_med_gpt2_xl_gpt_roberta_txl_bert_large

The whole cave park is a truly awesome sight, with holes 300 ft (91 m) deep and 200 ft (61 m) across, and caves thousands of feet deep, all surrounded by pristine forest. Some say that the fountain of youth is here, in the clean water filtering through the limestone from the surface. You don’t have to believe the legends, but taste the water anyway — it’s very sweet, and it can’t hurt to wish just a little. From the caves it’s a short	drive	to Lares, the island’s center of coffee production. The sweet brew made from Puerto Rican beans is considered one of the finest in the world, though production is small. Coffee plants, usually interspersed with other crops such as bananas or plantains, can be seen growing on the high hillsides; it is a crop that enjoys good drainage and lots of humidity, which the large banana leaves help to conserve. From Lares take Route 111 to reach the most important Amerindian site on Puerto Rico, the Parque Ceremonial Indígena Caguana (Caguana Indian Ceremonial Park). The park is set in a wide valley surrounded by limestone peaks, one of which is said to represent the supreme god of the Taínos.

Each day, the manager looks over the factory floor to see if any carts with a particular flag color are falling behind the others of that group. Delays in product flow can result from machine problems, worker absence, or if priority is given to special orders. In some plants, the carts may contain up to a day’s worth of work. Although this may appear to be a crude way of keeping track of the work flow, it is simple and generally effective. Still, work almost never progresses in perfect lockstep through a factory. Finding the correct parts for a shirt can often involve a hunt through the plant. For example, a worker might accidentally leave a bundle of unfinished work in the cart when it	goes	back to be loaded again. Because a worker may have a day’s work in the carts in front of her, it is easy to see how individual bundles of parts can be misplaced—which, in turn, will hold up the assembly of some SKUs. Partially finished shirts and shirt subassemblies will then be in a number of places in the factory. This shirt factory employs 250 workers. If the shirt in question is rated to require twelve minutes to assemble, such as the one in the figure, a forty-hour work week will produce 4,167 dozen shirts when the factory is operating at standard efficiency. (Of course, many plants may fall below the standard and take longer than twelve minutes to make that shirt.)10 A typical time for a shirt to go through the plant is four weeks, which means the plant will have 16,667 dozen shirts a	go	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt	4	44214	7	0.3346065452974975	gpt2_base_gpt2_med_roberta_txl_bert_base_bert_large_distilbert

The gate itself, designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, was built between 1789 and 1791. With two rows of six Doric columns forming the gateway proper, it was inspired by the Propylaeum gatehouse leading to the Parthenon in Athens. (To go all the way, Hitler had even planned to hoist the gate onto an artificial hill, in an attempt to create a mini-Acropolis.) Forming part of the city wall, the gate was intended by the more pragmatic Prussians not so much as a triumphal arch as an imposing tollgate for collecting duties. The gate was left isolated in no-man’s land when the Wall	went	up, and subsequently became the scene of quite ecstatic celebrations when it came down, though now you would scarcely believe it as Berliners cross nonchalantly from east to west through Brandenburg’s mighty central arch. The new US Embassy is being built nearby, on land originally occupied by that country’s pre-war embassy, and a large stretch of ground leading towards Potsdamer Platz has been designated as the site of a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.	go	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	3	45709	6	0.17139685785447725	bert_base_gpt2_base_gpt2_large_gpt2_med_gpt2_xl_txl

Entertainment Once the sun goes down, Cancún gears up. There’s no shortage of places to go or things to do, and no need to take a long novel to fill those quiet moments — there just won’t be any. Many people don’t take to their beds until they’ve seen the sun	come	up. If you choose to stay in Mujeres or Cozumel, things will be a bit more laid back. The diving fraternity tends to enjoy low-key, less glamorous entertainment and relatively early nights before they head under the waves early the following day. Before you head straight into the resort atmosphere of Cancún, check out what’s happening in your hotel. Many have “Las Vegas style” floor shows, Mexican evenings with traditional folk music and dances, and clubs where you can take to the dance floor yourself.	come	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhatToDo.txt	1	42142	6	0.21743647388119827	gpt2_base_gpt2_large_gpt2_med_gpt2_xl_gpt_txl

eijing Dongwu Yuan) is the creation of Empress Dowager Cixi, who in 1908 converted this private Ming Dynasty garden estate into a preserve for some 700 exotic animals imported from Germany. The entrance gate dates from the late Qing Dynasty, and many of the exhibition halls seem nearly as old. Even the outdoor pens seem quite dated. With some 6,000 animals the zoo is the largest in China, but despite its notable collection of giant pandas, Siberian tigers, golden monkeys, and red-crowned cranes, the facility is in need of modernization. Few foreign visitors are happy with the size and condition of the cages, although the new Panda Garden, featuring a half-dozen adult pandas and twin babies, is a bit more spacious and a step in the right direction. Most of the zoo’s recent major funding has	gone	to the creation of the adjacent Beijing Aquarium, a state-of-the-art marine park scheduled to have 50,000 aquatic species in residence.

The main hall contains a statue of the Buddha seated on a lotus leaf. Carved of camphorwood, it is 191⁄2 m (64 ft) high and thought to be the largest such sculpture in China. Nearby, the “Peak That Flew from Afar” (Feilaifeng) shelters 380 Buddhist stone carvings created during the Yuan Dynasty and four sacred caves.

The café life in Dali is one of its chief delights. Cafés are perfect spots to wile away the sunny hours over coffee or beer or to meet local Bai people as well as other travelers. Perhaps the most famous of the dozens of cafés is Mr. China Son’s Cultural Exchange Café, run by Uncle Li (Heliyi), the first Bai in history to go abroad. His autobiography, on sale at his café, is an epic soap opera. Dali also has sights and attractions well worth attending to when the café and bistro scene begins to pale. Erhai Lake is a 30-minute	walk	from town, and its main village, Caicun, is a maze of unpaved alleys and mud houses. Ferries cross the lake to even more remote villages, including the temple dedicated to Guanyin (goddess of mercy) on Putuo Island. Any of dozens of local travel agents can quickly arrange an excursion to lakeside villages, including the market at Wase. One popular diversion is the Monday morning outdoor market at Shaping, 30 minutes up the eucalyptus-lined road by minibus from Dali. It’s a vast market of country wares, batik, and horse-trading, with hundreds of locals dressed in their traditional bright Bai jackets, tunics, and plumed caps. The chief monument at Dali is the Temple of the Three Pagodas (Santasi), founded in 825. The tallest of the three towers, all sealed up, rises to 16 tiers.

Westside At Doheny Drive, the western edge of Hollywood merges with the slopes of Laurel Canyon and Beverly Hills, dotted with the sumptuous mansions of the movie moguls. While these homes are heavily guarded and hidden from view, you can sense the opulent atmosphere as you	drive	through the plush, carefully manicured avenues. The architecture is an astounding mixture of Spanish, Gothic, Bauhaus, and Renaissance, in every pastel shade under the sun. Don’t bother slowing down for the street vendors selling “official” maps showing the homes of the rich and famous — unless you get a kick out of security gates. Rodeo Drive (pronounced Ro-DAY-oh) is the famous shopping street (if you saw the movie Pretty Woman, you’ve seen Rodeo Drive) and it’s just as upscale and sophisticated as advertised. If you’re visiting in the summer or around Christmas, take a half-hour guided tour on the sweet Beverly Hills Trolley for $1. Meet the trolley on the corner of Rodeo and Dayton Way — it’s the only bargain you’ll find in the neighborhood.	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt	1	43018	5	0.15663018435851472	distilbert_gpt2_base_gpt2_med_gpt_txl

The chant states that they’re angels from heaven and are asking for gifts, although if they receive none, they may break doors and windows. The origin of this custom is not known, but some believe it is to remind society that the stranger at the door should not be forgotten. Lorin Brown reports that in northern New Mexico the children went out on Christmas Eve, but in Canutillo, Texas, around the 1920s, it was the custom for children to go door to door on Christmas Day, although they didn’t recite the above chant. The neighbors expected them and were ready with gifts of fruits and candies. Lottie C. Devine makes reference to the Papago Indians in Arizona, saying that on “Christmas Day most of them	came	to town, all dressed in party clothes, and went from house to house ‘calling Christmas.’ Everyone gave them candies and apples and many of them in turn gave baskets or pottery” (29). Cabeza de Baca refers to this custom as aguinaldos, and the chant she records is similar to the one above, except that the last line is “A pedir Aguinaldos y Oremos.” Aguinaldos are gifts given during the Christmas season.

It made a huge impression on me and was a big thing. Columbus, GA is the home of Fort Benning, GA, where the largest infantry school in the world at that time was there, and as a kid walking to school, and believe it or not, I did walk four or five miles to school and I would go up Brown Avenue, which was at that time the only road that would allow the convoys to	come	through.

While at La Guancha you may see groups of people across the narrow bay staring down into the water. More likely than not, they’re trying to catch sight of the giant tarpon that have taken to swimming around in the shallows. Hundreds of these fish — some are up to 7 ft (2 m) long — congregate here because they’ve learned they’ll be well supplied with tasty tidbits offered by the humans on shore. North of Ponce are attractions of a different kind. Take Route 503 out of town — this road runs along the banks of the Río Portuguéz — and after about a mile and a half (2 km) you’ll	arrive	at the Tibes Indian Ceremonial Park, one of the most important Amerindian archaeological sites in the Caribbean. The ceremonial site and cemetery are across the river, and you may not enter without a guide. A small museum explains the known history of the Amerindian races; it has a number of cabinets holding artifacts, as well as a skeleton, still in the traditional fetal burial position. Once you’re into the park, the ceremonial grounds come into view. Open spaces discovered since the 1960s are now believed to be used for “ball games,” which had an important though as yet only poorly understood ceremonial purpose in Indian culture. High in the hills behind Ponce is Hacienda Buena Vista. To get there, take Route 10, a major north-south artery.

On the western flank of the square you’ll find the Museo del Niño (Children’s Museum). No sterile display cases full of artifacts here! This is an entertaining, hands-on activity center where kids can be kids and yet still have a learning experience.

Behind the museum are a number of other important attractions. Take Calle las Monjas toward San Juan Bay.

Save your bargaining for the gypsies and antique dealers, but remember that they have been at it a long time. Beware of rebajas (sales); they may be genuine, but reductions are generally few and far between, especially in season. The Spanish government levies a value-added tax (called IVA) on most items. Tourists from overseas can get a refund on the IVA they’ve paid on purchases over a stipulated amount. Major tourist shops have forms and details. The refund eventually	arrives	at your home address. Summer shopping hours are generally from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. (During the rest of the year shops open later and close earlier.) The big Alicante and Valencia department stores stay open during the traditional siesta, which is the quietest time to shop. In the tourist season, small shops often stay open on a Saturday evening and Sunday morning.	arrive	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt	4	40741	5	0.11581340752509126	gpt2_base_gpt2_large_gpt2_xl_gpt_txl

Price records are being set at auctions this week. At Christie's, a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz's "Equivalents" series sold for $396,000, a single-lot record. Other works also have been exceeding price estimates. In part, prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints. This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal, says Beth Gates-Warren of Sotheby's. "There is finally some sort of sense in the market," she says. Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers, giving greater market stability, says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector. "When I see prints going into the hands of institutions, I know they aren't going to	come	back on the market." Most in demand: classic photographs by masters such as Stieglitz and Man Ray. But much contemporary work is also fetching "a great deal of money," says Miles Barth of the International Center of Photography. DIALING 900 brings callers a growing number of services.	come	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	masc_written	written	#newspaper:newswire#	newspaper:newswire_wsj_0120.txt	1	46642	5	0.1270735784757709	gpt2_base_gpt2_large_gpt2_med_gpt2_xl_roberta

nada’s national parks began, as so many things in this country, with the railways. When the C.P.R. reached Banff in 1883, the Rockies were suddenly opened up to public access, and the government decided, two years later, to preserve the region’s beauty by declaring Banff a national park. After three railway workers discovered hot sulfur springs bubbling from the earth, their bosses built one of their grandest castle-hotels, the Banff Springs, a monument to be visited even if you’re not staying there. The turreted edifice set down in the Bow River Valley has something of the fairytale castles of Ludwig of Bavaria. Take a canoe out on the river. If you’re feeling less energetic, take the waters at the Cave and Basin Springs, 3 km (2 miles) west of the hotel, or the Upper Hot Springs, a short	drive	south. The springs are 29°C (85°F) in winter, rising to 42°C (108°F) in summer. The eight-minute cable car ride from Upper Hot Springs up Sulfur Mountain (2,500 m/7,500 ft) will give you a panoramic view of the mountains around the Bow Valley.

Beyond you’ll find the tiny Barrio de Santa Cruz. This quarter is all that remains of the Villa Vieja, or old town. You can still see fascinating glimpses of traditional narrow streets where houses are decorated with potted plants and wrought-iron grilles. From this barrio you’ll be able to see the most prominent sight in Alicante, the historic Castillo de Santa Bárbara, perched 115 metres (350 feet) above the city on Mount Benacantil. The site has been fortified since prehistoric times and offers beautiful views of Aitana, San Juan, Santa Pola, and Benidorm and Tabarca islands in the distance. To get to the castle,	drive	up the winding road to the summit or use the lift at the far end of Calle Juan Bautista Lafora, close to Postiguet beach. Santa Bárbara, built by the Carthaginians in the third century b.c., was so well fortified that for nearly 2,000 years nobody conquered it. Only when the French succeeded in blowing up part of the garrison, during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1707, was the castle taken. On the opposite side of town in the Barrio San Blas is the smaller Castillo de San Fernando, begun during the War of Independence (1808–1814). The castle, set above the trees of the small Parque Municipal, provides a favourite spot for viewing Santa Bárbara and the port in the late afternoon.	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt	1	43070	4	0.32545640436951684	bert_base_bert_large_gpt2_xl_roberta

Cinema In L.A., the home of the film industry, there are three big annual events: an international film festival in April, sponsored by the American Film Institute; a European film festival in June; and a festival of comic films in September. The summit of Hollywood hype and glitter is attained in late March or early April, when the Oscars, or the Academy Awards, are handed out to the film industry’s brightest lights. The ceremony takes place at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and admission is by invitation only to members of the Motion Pictures Academy, nominees, and their guests.

Route 99 turns north at Horseshoe Bay (landing area for the Vancouver Island ferry) to become the Squamish Highway for a spectacular 100-km (60-mile) drive up to Whistler Mountain. The Coastal Mountains come right down to the water’s edge of the narrow Howe Sound, some forming a little archipelago in the sea. Stop off at Shannon Falls, a short	walk	away from the road on an easy gravel path over footbridges into the forest. You can picnic at the bottom of the cliff over which the water cascades. Famous for its August log-rolling contests, the town of Squamish makes a useful base for hiking tours into Garibaldi Provincial Park. The winter sports resort of Whistler offers excellent summer facilities, too: bicycles, kayak and river-rafting or more sedate swimming, golf, and tennis. Take the ski-lift for views across the Coastal Mountains or stroll around Lost Lake — good trout-fishing — but beware of a pretty yellow flower known as skunk cabbage that smells like its name when you pick it. As a delightful alternative to driving, you can travel from Vancouver to Squamish aboard the Royal Hudson 2860 steam train, a regular old puffer giving	walk	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	1	45170	4	0.14554417356583998	gpt2_base_gpt2_med_gpt2_xl_gpt

“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,” said my driver. I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills. “We interact with humans, take advantage of them, grant them boons, sometimes even become their friends, but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction. At this point, we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional. “The only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours. Love-ins, raves, gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion: that is where entities from this world tend to	go	when they cross over, and that is where Rachel met someone from this world. Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this, where the human population is so overwhelming that they won’t be noticed in the right corner, with the right protective spells.” He took out the hunchback’s directions and glanced at an alley behind us. “Okay, Nathan.

After three railway workers discovered hot sulfur springs bubbling from the earth, their bosses built one of their grandest castle-hotels, the Banff Springs, a monument to be visited even if you’re not staying there. The turreted edifice set down in the Bow River Valley has something of the fairytale castles of Ludwig of Bavaria. Take a canoe out on the river. If you’re feeling less energetic, take the waters at the Cave and Basin Springs, 3 km (2 miles) west of the hotel, or the Upper Hot Springs, a short	drive	south. The springs are 29°C (85°F) in winter, rising to 42°C (108°F) in summer. The eight-minute cable car ride from Upper Hot Springs up Sulfur Mountain (2,500 m/7,500 ft) will give you a panoramic view of the mountains around the Bow Valley.

John Law’s promotional activities weren’t confined to the French. He signed up some 10,000 Germans, mostly Rhinelanders, to share the “golden future” in Louisiana. Today, west of New Orleans along what is called the German Coast, you can see towns with names like Hahnville, Kraemer, and Des Allemands. Most descendants of the German pioneers, however, Frenchified their names, thus Delmaire was originally Edelmeyer and Fauquel was Vogel. Black slaves from Africa also	arrived	in the earliest years of the colony. In 1724, the Bienville enacted the Code Noir (Black Code), which regulated the conditions of slavery and the rights of free blacks. The code, more liberal than the laws elsewhere in the South, remained in force in Louisiana for a century. As for the Mississippi Bubble, it burst in 1720. France came out of the deal bankrupt and with huge pieces of land considered to be worthless. John Law died in 1729, dispossessed in Venice.

cut by so many tramlines that it is difficult to know which way to look, it has a very beautiful tower — Muntorren (Mint Tower). Originally a medieval gate guarding the entrance to the city, it was damaged by fire in 1619, and the clock tower was added by de Keyser during the renovations of 1620. In 1699 the carillon was installed and this still fills the air with its regular bell rounds. During the war with France in 1672, when Amsterdam had its supply of money cut off, the tower was transformed for a short time into the city mint, and the name has remained since that time. In the shadow of the tower, and floating on the Singel canal (the medieval protective moat for the city) is the Bloemenmarkt (Flower market). The daily market has been held for centuries, when the flower sellers would	arrive	by canal with boats laden with blooms. Today the stalls still float on the water but are permanently attached to the canal wall. The blooms they sell bring a splash of color to even the dullest Amsterdam day. Stroll along the market until you reach Konigsplein and take a left down Leidsestraat. This is a major shopping street and one of the busiest because it links one of the largest squares in the city to the central area.	arrive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	1	40472	4	0.07095629127085823	gpt2_large_gpt2_med_gpt2_xl_gpt

wide. A trip to the top by elevator affords spectacular views. It is here that you can best appreciate the tour de force of geometric planning the avenues represent. The Arc de Triomphe was conceived by Napoléon I as a tribute to his armies, and bears the names of hundreds of his marshals and generals, and dozens of victories. No defeats are recorded, naturally, although a few of the victories are debatable. Napoléon himself only ever saw a wood and canvas model: the arch was completed during the 1830s. It soon became the focus for state occasions, such as the return of the ex-emperor’s own remains from St. Helena in 1840 and the funeral of Victor Hugo in 1885. In 1920, the Unknown Soldier of World War I was buried at the arch; three years later the eternal flame was lit. When Adolf Hitler	arrived	in Paris as a conqueror in 1940, the Arc de Triomphe was the first place he wanted to see. And at the Liberation, this was the spot where General de Gaulle commenced his triumphal march down the Champs-Elysées. Avenue Foch, leading away from l’Etoile to the Bois de Boulogne, is one of the most majestic of the city’s residential avenues. It is one of the most exclusive, too, though somewhat democratized these days by the groups of boules players on its graveled side paths. Avenue de la Grande-Armée points straight to Neuilly and the towers of La Défense with the Grande Arche behind.	arrive	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt	3	40719	4	0.09422277955168895	gpt2_large_gpt2_med_gpt2_xl_txl

n the law. And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. And I'm going to make it a priority. Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them. That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows. One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. In Texas I tried to do something innovative. There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. I support that. But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe,	come	and get one for free. So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free. I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. I disagree with the vice president on this issue. He is for registration of guns. I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens. The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D. card. It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that. An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe. All right.

Fine. We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there. We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.

ross shark-infested waters to Florida on improvised rafts. Facing a dramatic influx of Cubans, President Clinton abolished the US policy of automatic asylum to Cuban refugees, placing them in a makeshift tent settlement in Guantánamo Bay Naval Base. In the opinion of many, Cuba is an isolated socialist dinosaur. Yet it — and its aging leader — soldier on against all odds. The US embargo, denounced by an ever-increasing majority in the United Nations, is spurred on by vehement anti-Castro lobbying by Cubans in southern Florida. Still, changes in the status quo seem likely. But nearly four decades after the Cuban missile crisis, the world continues to wait, wondering whether a lifting of US trade and tourism sanctions or a change in leadership in Cuba will	arrive	first.	arrive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-History.txt	1	40500	3	0.730736291052458	bert_base_bert_large_distilbert

Robe’s collection of New Mexico legends contains thirty-four variants of the devil-at-the-dance tale. Although the legends in this collection are from rural northern New Mexico, collected in the 1950s and 1960s, we find contemporary versions of the devil-at-the-dance tales in south Texas and in Baja California from the 1980s. Limón and Herrera-Sobek discuss versions of the tale circulating in nightclubs and discotheques among urbanized young people. Of course, not everyone believes such stories. Martin’s book contains a story by a man born in 1904, who says his friend played a trick on his community in Tucson by	coming	to a dance dressed in black, with a fake rooster foot. Eventually someone noticed his foot and yelled, “The Devil! The Devil!” The narrator says he was there when his friend played the trick, so he doesn’t believe in the legend (50).

counted by the dozen, so a production lot comes to 125 dozen. Each day, the manager looks over the factory floor to see if any carts with a particular flag color are falling behind the others of that group. Delays in product flow can result from machine problems, worker absence, or if priority is given to special orders. In some plants, the carts may contain up to a day’s worth of work. Although this may appear to be a crude way of keeping track of the work flow, it is simple and generally effective. Still, work almost never progresses in perfect lockstep through a factory. Finding the correct parts for a shirt can often involve a hunt through the plant. For example, a worker might accidentally leave a bundle of unfinished work in the cart when it	goes	back to be loaded again. Because a worker may have a day’s work in the carts in front of her, it is easy to see how individual bundles of parts can be misplaced—which, in turn, will hold up the assembly of some SKUs. Partially finished shirts and shirt subassemblies will then be in a number of places in the factory. This shirt factory employs 250 workers. If the shirt in question is rated to require twelve minutes to assemble, such as the one in the figure, a forty-hour work week will produce 4,167 dozen shirts when the factory is operating at standard efficiency. (Of course, many plants may fall below the standard and take longer than twelve minutes to make that shirt.)10 A typical time for a shirt to go through the plant is four weeks, which means the plant w	go	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt	4	44213	3	0.678263112340668	bert_base_bert_large_distilbert

For centuries Suzhou has been famous for its canals and gardens, its beautiful women, and the musical cadences of the local dialect. An old Chinese proverb, referring to the area’s linguistic charms, claims that even an argument in Suzhou sounds sweeter than flattery in Guangzhon. Marco Polo found the inhabitants better traders than warriors, and he described the city as large and magnificent. So much silk was produced, he reported, that every citizen was clothed in it and the surplus was exported. Even today, silk still retains its significance in the local economy. Whether you	go	to Suzhou from Shanghai or Nanjing, you will be moved by the wayside scenery, typical of China’s “land of fish and rice.” Sampans and scows ply the canals that divide the farmlands, where barefoot peasants in straw coolie hats squelch through the muddy rice fields. The Grand Canal is crowded with strings of barges laden with fruit and vegetables, construction materials, or coal. Suzhou in fact means “Plentiful Water.” The Grand Canal, second only to the Great Wall as a Chinese engineering achievement, was started 2,400 years a	go	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	1	44129	3	0.29036352491732353	bert_base_bert_large_roberta

Berkeley Take the BART subway from Market Street or	drive	across the Bay Bridge to make a pilgrimage to the University of California campus at Berkeley (pronounced BIRK-lee), the scene of 1960s student radicalism. Opened in 1873, Berkeley is the oldest of the University of California’s nine campuses. Tours of the museums, library, gardens, and other sights are organized from the Student Union at the end of Telegraph Avenue (Monday–Saturday at 10am). The free and easy access to the university’s facilities will give you an insight into Berkeley’s open personality. The nearby streets are lined with lively cafés and interesting bookshops. If you’re driving, head over to Fourth Street for good food and prodigious shopping and people-watching.

Tiburon is the quieter of the two, while Sausalito is more of a tourist trap, but both have a colorful Mediterranean atmosphere, with art galleries, yacht harbors, craft shops, and pleasant bistros and cafés out on the boardwalk overlooking the bay. Farther inland is the woodsy residential paradise of Mill Valley, and behind it rises the 2,604-ft (794-m) summit of Mount Tamalpais. The mountain bike was invented here in the 1970s, and there are plenty of hiking and biking trails, but if you’re feeling lazy you can	drive	along the Panoramic Highway to within a few hundred yards of the summit. The view from the top is memorable — across the bay to the city and then beyond to Mount Diablo, and on a clear day you might even catch a glimpse of the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains. Highway 1 twists through the hills to the coast, past the Muir Woods National Monument, named after John Muir, the Scots-born environmentalist, who founded California’s conservation movement at the turn of the 19th century. The park protects several groves of magnificent coastal redwoods, some of which are 250 ft (76 m) tall and over 1,000 years old. Hiking trails wind among the giant trees.	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt	1	43011	3	0.282758999781808	bert_base_distilbert_txl

Marin County Immediately north of San Francisco are two charming waterfront towns — Sausalito and Tiburon — which you can reach either by	driving	across the Golden Gate Bridge or by taking a ferry — from the Ferry Building at the foot of Market Street, or Pier 41 near Fisherman’s Wharf. Tiburon is the quieter of the two, while Sausalito is more of a tourist trap, but both have a colorful Mediterranean atmosphere, with art galleries, yacht harbors, craft shops, and pleasant bistros and cafés out on the boardwalk overlooking the bay.	drive	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt	2	43464	3	0.3757660625242556	bert_base_distilbert_roberta

On the road to Knossós, look for the Natural History Museum of Crete — an often overlooked attraction but worthwhile for those who enjoy geology, flora, and fauna. Exhibits concentrate on endemic species and the diverse environments that Crete has to offer. It also examines man’s effect on the island from his earliest arrival to the present day. Other classical sites lay below Iráklion near the south coast. Take the road to Agía Vavára, in a vine-filled valley skirting the looming mountains of the Ida range to the west. Here you’ll find the Messará Plain, a wide fertile valley surrounded by hills, which has been a center for farming since ancient times. For a pretty	drive	along the upper reaches of the valley, take the road to Zarós from Agía Vavára. The scenery is magnificent and you can visit Moní Vrontisí, a small monastery in the hills above the town, which was the original home of the Damaskinós icons — now in Agía Ekaterínis in Iráklion. This road leads through the villages of Kamáres where there is a large cave, and links up with the Amari Valley to the west (see page 62). To reach the ancient sites drop down from Agía Vavára on to the Plain. Near the village of Agía Déka — named after ten saints who were martyred here — and widely scattered in farmland, are the remains of Górtis (Gortyn), capital of the island during the Roman era (from 65 b.c.) and also an important city in Minoan times.	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt	1	43069	3	0.3440930799615664	bert_large_gpt2_large_roberta

The ruminative buffalo pulls plows and carts, then wallows in the mud of a village pond. Chickens run in and out of doorways and often may be seen peering out from roosts on the second floor of houses. Under the eaves, bundles of maize hang to dry along with large cucumbers. Pumpkin vines climb over rooftops. Saturday is a good day to visit Dakshinkali (a 45-minute	drive	from Kathmandu to the southern end of the valley), when thousands of pilgrims bring chickens and goats to sacrifice to Kali. Sacrifices also take place on Tuesday. The shrine is at the bottom of a shady glen by a brook. Carrying their offerings by the feet (incidentally, only male animals may be sacrificed), women form a line on one side and men on the other. The altar where the blood will be spilled is out of sight, behind a wall where a loudspeaker screeches hymns to Kali. Under a bridge, a cauldron bubbles. Decapitated fowl are chucked in to speed the plucking and goats are seared to remove the hair. The offal is thrown into the stream.	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	1	43076	3	0.2482331567083281	bert_large_distilbert_gpt

Brücke Museum The Bridge Museum is an intimate, single-story museum situated in a pleasant suburb about 20 minutes’	walk	from Jagdschloß Grunewald. Take U1 to Oskar-Helene-Heim, then bus 115 to Pücklerstraße. The museum is 5 minutes from the bus stop. The museum was created in 1967 to house works of classical modernism, thanks to a legacy of Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, a member of the Expressionist group Die Brücke which worked in Dresden from 1905 to 1913. A large number of the group’s works were labeled as “degenerate” and thus destroyed by the Nazis. Schmidt-Rottluff’s own bold paintings hang beside the works of fellow Expressionists Emil Nolde, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, and Max Pechstein.	walk	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	1	45129	3	0.5130822230890312	distilbert_gpt2_xl_gpt

The topographical highlight of the Arrábida peninsula is undoubtedly the Serra da Arrábida (site of a nature reserve), a mountain chain around 35 km (22 miles) long which protects the coast from the strong north winds and accounts for the Mediterranean vegetation. The tiny little beach spot, Portinho da Arrábida, is popular with Portuguese weekenders. Setúbal, the district capital, is just a 20-minute	drive	from Lisbon by motorway, longer if you take the picturesque route via Sesimbra and Arrábida. This is olive and citrus country, with cows grazing among the trees. Setúbal is a conglomeration of market town, industrial center, resort, and Portugal’s third largest fishing port. Setúbal’s greatest historical and artistic treasure, the Gothic Igreja de Jesus, was built around 1490 by the great French architect Boytac, who later built Lisbon’s glorious Jerónimos Monastery (see page 36). A dramatic main portal leads into the church, which boasts two inspired elements of decoration: 17th-century azulejos on the walls, and stone pillars like twisted strands of clay, fragile-looking in spite of their obviously solid dimensions.	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt	1	43081	3	0.37893882090713177	distilbert_gpt_txl

Without doubt, the initial lure of the city is its numerous historic buildings. The lines of tall, narrow houses with their pretty gables rest beside picture-perfect tree-lined canals. They are connected by ornate iron bridges and cobbled walkways, which have changed little for over 300 years, in fact, since they felt the footfall of such inhabitants as the artist Rembrandt and explorer Abel Tasman, who gave his name to Tasmania. Amsterdam is a wonderful city for visitors. Small enough to stroll around, and with the canal side streets too narrow for tour buses, you can’t	drive	past all the best attractions at high speed. Here, there is no glass window between you and reality. You have to feel the summer sun, or see your breath on a crisp winter morning as you step out to see what Amsterdam is all about. If you take a canal tour, the quiet boats allow you to float slowly along, away from the noise of the modern world. The museums could keep you busy for weeks. Art collections, historic houses, and memorials to heroes and heroines can all be found here. For entertainment after the sun sets, there are over 40 different performances in the city every evening. The Netherlands National Opera and National Ballet are based here, and there are numerous orchestral, musical, and comedy venues, along with revues and dance shows.

know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. But take Russia, for example. We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. They're going to have to make the decision themselves. Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make. So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is	coming	from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, we do it this way, so should you.

rsistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera. But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. With the horse went the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. With the car	came	paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. Most firms die young, some last a long time. We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions. The parallels are at least tantalizing, and probably more than that.

a codefined cluster of concepts that carve up the world in some new way. Consider, he said, legal language, and try translating it to ordinary statements about human agents without using legal concepts. So consider, “The jury found Henderson guilty of murder.” We understand this statement but do so in the context of law, evidence, legal responsibility, trials, guilt and innocence, jury systems, bribing jury members, appeal processes, and so forth. Now try to translate the statement into a set of statements about ordinary human actions, “A group of twelve people were seated behind a wooden enclosure for several days. People talked about someone having died of poison. One day, the twelve people left the room and went to another room and talked about what had happened. Then the twelve people	came	back and one man stood up and uttered the words, ‘We find Henderson guilty of murder.’” There is no finitely prespecifiable list of statements about ordinary human actions whose truth would be necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement that the jury found Henderson guilty of murder.	come	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	3	40919	3	0.10310370719602946	gpt2_base_gpt2_large_gpt2_med

of the royal architect, and the tour de force of Vila Real. The pavement’s black and white wedges of stone radiate from an obelisk in the center of the square like rays from the sun. Distinguished three-story, late 18th-century houses line the square, and orange trees soften the edges, adding color and scent. Visit the small Manuel Cabanas Museum, just off the square, to see a nice collection of woodcuts that ranges from rustic scenes to famous statesmen and composers. Today Vila Real is sleepy but quietly dignified. A walk around the old quarter reveals a number of fine, brightly painted houses along pedestrian-only streets. Vila Real de Santo António’s main appeal is as the ferry port to Ayamonte across the water in Spain. The trip takes just 20 minutes — less time than it would take to	drive	to and over the new bridge — and the white town of Ayamonte is a fine sight as you approach it from the river.

Scores of lighthouses along Nova Scotia’s south shore trace a sawtoothed route of coves that over the ages offered shelter to pirates, rum-runners, and fishermen. For the modern holidaymaker, there are plenty of pleasant bathing beaches, too. The 45-minute, 48-km (30-mile)	drive	along winding coastal Highway 333 from Halifax southwest to Peggy’s Cove has become a photographer’s pilgrimage. This almost unbearably picturesque fishing village perches its brightly colored clapboard cottages and lighthouse among massive granite boulders.

Perhaps one of the most beautiful and unusual buildings in Charlotte Amalie is the St. Thomas Synagogue, on Crystal Gade. This is the oldest synagogue building in continual use under the American flag. The Jewish congregation has always been strong here, from the very earliest days of Danish settlement in 1655. When the all-consuming fire of 1831 broke out, 64 families were worshipping in the small synagogue. Only one scroll could be saved before the flames destroyed the building. The present structure was built on the same spot and opened in 1833. The synagogue has sand on the floor, symbolic of the Jewish flight from Egypt. The cruise port is situated at the West Indian Company Dock, a mile or so east of town. The thirty-minute	walk	around the harbor is pleasant if the traffic is not too busy. Those who want to ride will find numerous taxis waiting to take them to and from Charlotte Amalie. The dock is one of the largest, and busiest, in the Caribbean. Old Danish warehouses along the dockside have been transformed in recent years, creating Havensight Shopping Mall. Over 80 tax-free boutiques with cafés and restaurants sit only feet away from the huge ships. You will also find the ticket office for Atlantis Submarine in the Havensight Mall. This mini-submarine, which seats around thirty, takes you some 60 ft (18 m) under the sea to view coral reefs and the marine life that inhabits them. A ferry takes you out to Buck Island some 3 miles (5 km) offshore to rendezvous with the sub, which then submerges to spend about an h	walk	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	1	45241	3	0.10533418135630634	gpt2_base_gpt2_large_bert_large

Inland from Benidorm The mountains you see off in the distance on Benidorm’s horizon are fragrant with wild herbs and lavender, and in July and August the hedges are lush with blackberries that few local people bother to pick. Drive south on the motorway to Villajoyosa, then take the road that leads to Sella. The countryside is undistinguished, until suddenly you look down on the emerald-green waters of the Amadorio Dam, a favourite haunt of fishermen and discerning picnickers. Within another 5 km (3 miles) you	arrive	at Sella village, dwarfed beneath an extraordinary plateau. From Sella the road winds higher through terraced hillsides filled with vines until it reaches its highest point at Puerto de Tudóns (1,015 metres/3,345 feet). About 8 km (5 miles) on, a secondary road leads to Peñaguila, an exquisite old Moorish village with a sturdy ruined castle.	arrive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt	1	40499	3	0.046505394165563686	gpt2_base_gpt2_large_gpt2_med
bundle system is used. Shirts are normally counted by the dozen, so a production lot comes to 125 dozen. Each day, the manager looks over the factory floor to see if any carts with a particular flag color are falling behind the others of that group. Delays in product flow can result from machine problems, worker absence, or if priority is given to special orders. In some plants, the carts may contain up to a day’s worth of work. Although this may appear to be a crude way of keeping track of the work flow, it is simple and generally effective. Still, work almost never progresses in perfect lockstep through a factory. Finding the correct parts for a shirt can often involve a hunt through the plant. For example, a worker might accidentally leave a bundle of unfinished work in the cart when it	goes	back to be loaded again. Because a worker may have a day’s work in the carts in front of her, it is easy to see how individual bundles of parts can be misplaced—which, in turn, will hold up the assembly of some SKUs. Partially finished shirts and shirt subassemblies will then be in a number of places in the factory. This shirt factory employs 250 workers. If the shirt in question is rated to require twelve minutes to assemble, such as the one in the figure, a forty-hour work week will produce 4,167 dozen shirts when the factory is operating at standard efficiency. (Of course, many plants may fall below the standard and take longer than twelve minutes to make that shirt.)10 A typical time for a shirt to go through the plant is four weeks, which means the plant will have 16,667 dozen shirts a	go	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt	4	44213	3	0.17077018995867324	gpt2_base_roberta_txl

you. Breakfast might be a bowl of porridge or toast and eggs. After a bit of a wash-up from a basin of warm water, you’ll be on the trail by 7am. No need to worry about packing up the tent or cleaning the breakfast dishes: that’s what you’ve hired the porters to do. Porters stop for their first real meal of the day — rice and lentils — between 10 and 11am, and consequently, trekkers can also expect to eat lunch fairly early, usually on the edge of a village or at a scenic vista. After a bit of exploration in the area, there will be a few more hours of hiking before calling it quits for the day around 3pm, once again usually in an interesting village. The porters will then busy themselves with setting up camp, usually in a designated campground, and preparing the evening meal. The sun often	goes	behind the mountains early, and supper always follows soon after sunset, usually around 6pm. With only kerosene lamps to keep away the dark, exhausted trekkers usually head for bed by 9pm. For trekkers doing a lodge-to-lodge trek, the day’s schedule is slightly different. There is usually no “bed tea,” but there might be a wide range of choices for breakfast (many lodges now have electric ovens, and fresh baked breads and rolls are all the rage).	go	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt	4	44359	3	0.03951146317548752	gpt2_base_gpt2_large_txl

Arriving via Route 191 you’ll come right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park. This facility presents important information about the history of the park, its plant and animal species, and its role in the local ecology. You can then travel on higher into the park, toward the summit. You can’t drive the whole 8 miles (13 km) between the visitors center and the end of the road, but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way, so there’s ample access. Two popular stops are La Coca Falls, on the right after the 5-mile (8-km) point, and the Yokahú Observation Tower, at the 51⁄2-mile (9-km) point. Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes.

The main attraction is the 26-km- (16-mile-) long sandy shores of Jandía that run from the narrowest part of Fuerteventura down to Morro Jable. At the northern tip of the Jandía sands are the beautiful beaches of Costa Calma, not blighted as yet by over-development. Here, a low cliff backing and a scattering of rocks and coves give the beach far more character than some of the seemingly endless stretches farther south. The Playa de Sotavento is world-famous as a windsurfing center, with activity focused on the F2 school at the Sol Elite Gorriones Hotel. This has one of the best, and most isolated beach locations in all of the islands. Here the beach is very wide and flat, usually empty and, as the tides	go	out, also very wet. The dunes behind and a little farther to the south form an idyllic beach backdrop. Urbanizaciones spread relentlessly all the way down the coast to Morro Jable, which has some similarities with its northern sister Corralejo; both are ports and resorts, but in most other aspects are quite dissimilar. Whereas Corralejo is flat, rather dingy, without many hotels and restaurants of much class, and doesn’t have much of its own beach, Morro Jable, built along the cliffs, is bright and airy, boasts numerous fine hotels and restaurants, and has miles of wonderful beaches. It is interesting to note that while Corralejo is a mainly British resort Morro Jable, on the other hand, is frequented predominantly by Germans. There are more fine beaches towards the southern tip of the isla	go	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt	1	44114	3	0.12674008506297793	gpt2_large_gpt2_med_gpt

Yardas (Gardens) Although the Spanish word for garden is jardín, many Chicano families favor the term “yard” while referring to their gardens, pronouncing it in Spanish as yarda. Although yarda appears to be a pochismo (Chicano slang), it can be found in Cassell’s Spanish Dictionary. The layout and organizational aesthetics of Chicano yardas are unique enough that folklorists and cultural geographers have written about them. Many yardas can aesthetically constitute yard art, even though it does not appear that this is the intent of the creator. Besides planting shrubs, flowers, and sometimes grass, the gardener will bring into play the creativity that	goes	into decorating a yard unconsciously, with the result being a folk art display. Invariably, a yard will contain many potted flowers arranged in a patterned manner. The central focus of many yards is often a devotional shrine set up in memory of a family member, with a nicho housing a saint or Madonna, and the design of the yard’s plants and flowers is laid out in reference to the shrine. Some yardas may not have planted grass, but instead hard-packed dirt that is kept free of weeds, swept frequently, and kept prepared for family gatherings. But trees, preferably fruit trees, abound to make shade for family gatherings and outdoor cooking.

uilt into the rocks more than compensates. Despite the destruction, Garachico is a little gem. Neat houses boasting typically attractive Canarian balconies line cobbled streets, and old churches adorn pretty squares. Unmissable, also, is the large, uninhabited rock out in the bay, and it has managed to gain for itself a place in the spiritual life of Garachico. Without a patron saint of its own, the town has elevated the rock to be its saint! Farther along the coast road, 8 km (5 miles) past Buenavista del Norte, lies the most westerly point on Tenerife, the Punta de Teno.

Beyond the City Wall From the Parc de l’Esplanade,	drive	up the Côte de la Citadelle hill road and through a tunnel for a guided tour around a powerful bastion of fears long gone. The French built the starshaped Citadel in 1750 to resist the British. The British enlarged it in 1820 to defend Québec City against the Americans, but their cannons never fired a shot in anger. The garrison was British-manned for only 20 years before being handed over to Canadian troops. Today it is the home of Canada’s crack Royal 22nd Regiment. In summertime the garrison comes to life with the Changing of the Guard (10am daily, June 24–first week of Sept.) and Beating the Retreat (6pm Wed–Sat during July and August). The old powder house serves now as the Musée Militaire, displaying the regiment’s history with its trophies, weapons, and uniforms.	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	1	43031	3	0.13718279598927946	gpt2_large_gpt2_xl_roberta

Isla Mujeres (Island of the Women) lies only 8 km (5 miles) offshore from Cancún; the 40-minute ferry ride transports you from an ultra-modern atmosphere to an environment in which time moves more slowly. Several companies offer one-day sailing trips to Isla Mujeres, often including lunch and snorkeling; they depart from Playa Linda and Pier Tortugas in the Hotel Zone. Isla Mujeres now has a population of around 15,000. In past centuries, however, it was the haunt of Caribbean pirates, being far from the clutches of colonial overlords in Havana, San Juan in Puerto Rico, and Panama City, the nearest colonial outposts. The earliest recorded visitors	arrived	in 1517, when Spanish explorer Francisco Hernández de Córdoba landed to discover a number of small temples built for the goddess of fertility Ix chel. It was he who named the island. Mujeres is only 8 km (5 miles) in length, less than a kilometer (1⁄2 mile) at its widest point, and split by inland lakes and bays. One main road forms an ellipse, following the shape of the coastline. Most ferries deposit you at the very northern tip of the island, on the main pier of the only town on Mujeres. Craft shops and bars crowd onto the sidewalks and sandy streets. The place bustles, especially when the ferries arrive. As afternoon turns to evening and the day-trippers head back to Cancún, Isla Mujeres takes on a much quieter character. The island has many loyal fans that return year after year for it	arrive	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt	3	40702	3	0.16504157034714587	gpt2_large_gpt2_med_roberta

I have sent you the enclosed complimentary name-and-address labels to call your attention to the work of the ASPCA. Please USE them on your correspondence to help get our name in front of as many people as possible. Because the ASPCA -- and the thousands of animals we help every year --need all the friends we can get! As a person who cares about animals, you’re probably anxious to know what happened to Astro. A neighbor reported Astro’s plight to the ASPCA and our Humane Law Enforcement officers	went	to investigate. When our officers arrived, Astro was too weak to even stand up.

The Scroll Market, in the Xicheng District inside the Second Ring Road North, sells handpainted scrolls, chops, and goldfish. A bit farther north from here, the Bird Market sells songbirds and ornate cages. The Sanlitun District has a large wicker and bamboo market, as well as a sportswear market, amidst its café and bar strip. The Hongqiao Market (also known as the Chongwenmen Market and the Farmers’ Market), on the northeast edge of the Temple of Heaven (Tiantan) Park, is the best place to shop for jewelry bargains, especially pearls. The Panjiayuan Antique and Curio Market (variously known as the “Dirt Market,” “Ghost Market,” and “Sunday Market”) is the most interesting to browse in Beijing.

s reach out into Boston Harbor from Downtown and the North End like the fingers on a hand. Once this was the second busiest port in the United States, with clippers jostling for space. Today after a long period of decline, the area has revived and the granite warehouses have been renovated into apartments, restaurants, offices, and hotels. The British sailed home from Long Wharf. Today you can sail to the Harbor Islands, take a cruise around the harbor, or just sit and admire the craft at anchor. On Central Wharf, the New England Aquarium is one of the best anywhere. Its centerpiece is a giant 200,000-gallon tank containing a 24-ft- (7-m-) deep coral reef filled with sharks, sea turtles, and 600 fish from 100 species. Five times a day, scuba divers	go	in to feed the fish, a fascinating spectacle to watch. Ramps circle the tank so that you can walk around the whole thing.

whole front yard of a home. Outdoor nacimientos will have life-size figures of Mary and Joseph and various other biblical characters and animals. This custom is not particular to the Chicano community, and nativity scenes can be found throughout the country during the Christmas season. It is thought that Saint Francis of Assisi is the saint responsible for much of the veneration of the infant Jesus, and the custom of creating nativity scenes or monuments to the birth of Christ has been going on for hundreds of years. In private homes nacimientos are usually set up for the first night of Las Posadas, which starts on December 16 and continues until December 24.

New subject, new question, Vice President Gore. How do you see the connection between controlling gun sales in this country and the incidence of death by accidental or intentional use of guns? Jim, I hope that we can	come	back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed. But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned. I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns.

ace of staggering proportions: there are over 200 species of native trees. One specimen is said to be over 2,500 years old; some trees are so wide it takes several people to reach around them; others soar hundreds of feet into the air. The forest gets over 180 inches (41���2 m) of rain each year — that’s some 100 billion gallons (450 billion liters) of water. The animals that live here are also amazing. This is one of the last habitats of the threatened Puerto Rican parrot. The infamous coquí (see page 47)is, of course, heard everywhere. All in all, the park in an impressive sight, with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance. Arriving via Route 191 you’ll	come	right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park. This facility presents important information about the history of the park, its plant and animal species, and its role in the local ecology. You can then travel on higher into the park, toward the summit. You can’t drive the whole 8 miles (13 km) between the visitors center and the end of the road, but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way, so there’s ample access. Two popular stops are La Coca Falls, on the right after the 5-mile (8-km) point, and the Yokahú Observation Tower, at the 51⁄2-mile (9-km) point. Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes. The most spectacular cascade in the park, La Mina Falls, is just a 30-minute walk from the roadside, via Big Tre	come	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	1	42200	2	0.287248359911644	bert_base_bert_large

Latin Quarter As far back as the 13th century, when Paris’s first university moved from the cloisters of Notre-Dame to the Left Bank, the young	came	to the quartier to learn Latin. Here, the tradition of scholastic inquiry has often evolved into a spirit of protest and outright revolt before subsiding into a lifelong skepticism. In ancient days the university simply meant a collection of scholars who met on a street corner or in a public square or courtyard to listen to a lecture given from a bench or balcony. Now the tradition of open-air discussion continues over coffee or a glass of wine on some café terrace on the boulevard St-Michel or in the streets around the faculty buildings.	come	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt	3	41356	2	0.2325136906329001	bert_base_roberta

eir primary reason for not doing so was to save money, not to piss off the victims of Colubmine. That does not change the fact that they did just that. Moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff. This is what good documentary filmmaking is about. And here the critics again ignore important evidence: When Heston mentions the mayor of Denver, the crowd boos loudly. Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayor's letter (only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request -- not mentioning at all the reasons you have given!). This booing by the crowd, not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article, shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by	coming	to Littleton after children were being killed there -- and they effectively said "Fuck you". To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moore's critics. 4) The Kayla Rolland case. Again, critics like yourself charge Moore with deception. The rally took place on October 17, the shooting on February 29. Again, standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion: "Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas. It is brilliantly, if unethically, done." As noted above, the "from my cold dead hands" part is simply Moore's way to introduce Heston. Did anyone but Moore's critics view it as anything else?

Yet, he thought himself back prior to the Philadelphia convention and the creation of the presidency. He pulled the rug of legitimacy out from under his own office. To be able to advocate the principle that all men are created equal, that a nation was born committed to this principle, he had to speak from a time prior to the creation of the government for which the Union troops died. The precursor to this unusual mode of dating comes in an unexpected place—in the final paragraph of the Emancipation Proclamation, which	went	into effect on January 1, 1863: Done at the City of Washington, this first day of	go	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt	3	45526	2	0.6897267890999315	bert_base_distilbert

those marked out inside the forest. These “New Scottish” highlands look uncannily like those in the old country. To ram the point home, there’s even a Scottish shepherd’s cottage, Lone Shieling, off the highway at Grande Anse River. The forest, a mixture of conifers and hardwoods, shelters white-tailed deer, black bear, moose, beaver, red fox, lynx, mink, and snowshoe hare. Bird-watchers can spot, among many species, red-tailed hawk and the occasional bald eagle. Fishermen should get their license at the park entrance to angle for trout or salmon (no motorboats allowed). On the northeast corner of the park, Neil Harbor is a pleasant little fishing port with sandy beaches. To explore the northern tip of the island, leave the park at South Harbor and	drive	16 km (10 miles) to the fishing village of Bay St. Lawrence. Following a common seaport custom, the white clapboard village church, with its nave shaped like an upturned ship, was designed and built by local shipwrights. Take a bracing hike along the grassy cliff top west of town, but beware of the winds. Southwest of the park, Chéticamp is an old stronghold of Acadian culture, with a museum exhibiting craftware as it was crocheted, spun, hooked, or woven in bygone centuries. At the museum’s little restaurant you can sample a traditional meal of clam chowder, meat pâté, and molasses cakes. Expert anglers insist that the salmon fishing near Margaree Forks is the best in eastern Canada.

And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel.

The other big temple in town, Shanhua Monastery, faces the old city wall, which is undergoing renovation. The monastery dates from the Tang Dynasty, but it was largely rebuilt after a fire. Standing in the grand, red-walled pavilion are 24 celestial guardians, each of distinct mien. A circular “moon gate” in the side wall of the monastery leads to the Five Dragon Wall (Wulongbi), transplanted here from a former Confucian temple. This ceramic screen resembles the lavish Nine Dragon Wall in the town center, but here the middle dragon, terrifyingly, faces forward. A major attraction near Datong is the Temple Suspended Over the Void (Xuankongsi), situated a two-hour	drive	south through a barren sandstone plateau. Tours usually stop along the way at one of the area’s cave houses, where residents are happy to show off their hand-dug quarters. The sixth-century temple is spectacular, with over 40 halls and pavilions which are joined by ornate catwalks, suspended as if by magic on the face of a sheer limestone cliff.

entertainment Spaniards have earned a reputation as consummate partiers, and while Barcelona may not be as fanatical about late nights as Madrid, it is still a place that really swings when the sun	goes	down. It has virtually every kind of nightlife diversion, from cool cabarets to live jazz, rock, flamenco, and world beat to opera, and a thriving bar and disco scene. At night, some streets, like the Rambla and Passeig de Gràcia, become slow-moving rivers of strollers. The main churches and monuments are illuminated, and the city takes on a new and graceful aspect. The weekly cultural guide Guía del Ocio contains up-to-date information on all entertainment in Barcelona (available at newsstands, in Spanish), while Barcelona Olé!, a monthly guide put out by Barcelona Tourism, has information on big shows and performances.	go	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt	4	44336	2	0.21195011717048295	distilbert_txl

ed critical biosphere with a power law distribution of small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events. As we shall see, the best data now suggest that precisely such a power law distribution of extinction and speciation events has occurred over the past 650 million years of the Phanerozoic. In addition, the same body of theory predicts that most species go extinct soon after their formation, while some live a long time. The predicted species lifetime distribution is a power law. So too are the data. Similar phenomena may occur in an econosphere. Small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events occur in our technologies. A colleague, Brian Arthur, is fond of pointing out that when the car came in, the horse, buggy, buggy whip, saddlery, smithy, and Pony Express	went	out of business. The car paved the way for an oil and gas industry, paved roads, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote about this kind of turbulence in capitalist economies. These Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction appear to occur in small and large avalanches. Perhaps the avalanches arise in power laws. And, like species, most firms die young; some make it to old age = Storre, in Sweden, is over nine hundred years old. The distribution of firm lifetimes is again a power law. Here are hints = common law, ecosystems, economic systems = that general principles govern the coevolutionary coconstruction of lives and livings, organisms and natural games, firms and economic opportunities. Perhaps such a law governs any biosphere anywhe	go	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt	3	45528	2	0.05017083197597383	gpt2_base_gpt2_med

Long before the first European sailors beached in the Canaries, all seven islands were inhabited. The original Canarians came to be called Guanches, meaning in the native tongue “man.” Strictly speaking, this name applies only to the original inhabitants of Tenerife. The Guanches are thought to have	arrived	in the islands around the 1st or 2nd century b.c., probably from North Africa. Ethnographers link them with the Cro-Magnon and Proto-Mediterranean race. They were tall, light-skinned, often blue-eyed and blond-haired. You can see their remains in the meticulous collection of the Museo Canario in Las Palmas on Gran Canaria. Here too you can study their preoccupation with death. Like the ancient Egyptians they carefully embalmed their dead, presumably for a ceremonial passage to the next world.

describe themselves and their experience of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to come to the United States. Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos, with the same prejudicial meaning as “greaser” or “spic.” Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants. Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called “wets.” Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels. In Mexico, the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas, a literal translation for the word wetback. In 1955 a well--established Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas, which intended to persuade Mexicans not to	go	to the United States. It was a political film that incorporated all of the standard characters that would appear in countless other films and novels of the Chicano experience: the wetback, the pocho (half Mexican), the coyote (smuggler) who smuggles people into the United States, and the grower Mister Sterling. An ironic, yet justified ending shows Mister Sterling dumped into the Rio Grande by Mexicans, and as he swims to the U.S. side of the border he is shot by the Border Patrol. In a 1998 article Herrera-Sobek discusses the use of corridos in several Mexican films that depict the plight of the illegal immigrant, or el mojado.

weren’t good and helped him carry in wood and water and feed the animals ‘la mano negra’ would come for us at night. It would get really big, take us from our beds and never bring us back home” (November 1974). Members of the academic electronic listserv CHICLE have held discussions and reminisced about La Mano Negra. One member remembered it by the name of La Mano Pachona without knowing its origin, but the fear of it was well remembered by all. Marc Simmons writes about a legend of La Mano Negra from the town of Bernalillo, New Mexico. An old priest dies, but the villagers believe he was unable to complete all his work because his spirit frequently returns. When the bell of the church is heard ringing late at night, the local Indians come to listen, and they see the spirit of the priest	going	into the church and praying. They call the Hispanos to come and see, and when the priest is seen in the church one of the observers cries out. At this point the priest places his hand on the missal and vanishes. “Burned through several pages was the scorched imprint of the padre’s hand, La Mano Negro.” Simmons states that he recalls a similar legend from Ireland (2).

There are beaches and excellent diving farther west, near Playa María la Gorda, but for most visitors the star attractions are the irresistible town of Viñales and its beautiful valley. Many visitors take organized daytrips of the region from Havana hotels, but an overnight stay in Viñales — overlooking the valley — is highly recommended. Start your explorations by	driving	west on the autopista (highway) linking Havana with the province’s capital city of Pinar del Río. About 63 km (39 miles) along the highway, a turnoff leaves the level, palm-dotted plains for Soroa, where a richly endowed botanical garden nestles in the mountain foothills near a tired little tourist complex. A guided tour reveals an orchid garden, lychee and mango trees, coffee plants, and splendid specimens of jagüey and ceiba trees. A restaurant in the villa of Castillo de las Nubes on a nearby mountain has stunning views. At the end of the highway, 175 km (109 miles) west of Havana, the small city of Pinar del Río is a bustling commercial center. Along the main street, Calle José Martí, low-rise neoclassical buildings in blues, yellows, greens, and orange have a stately but dilapidated qu	drive	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt	2	43469	2	0.0383258733638686	gpt2_base_txl

Stanley Park Covering a magnificent peninsula proudly dominating English Bay, this is undoubtedly one of North America’s finest city parks. Its forest of majestic Douglas firs, cedars, and Sitka spruce remind us it was once a government reserve providing mast and spar timbers for the Royal Navy. At the turn of the century, the town leased it as a park, named after Lord Stanley, Canada’s governor general. His bronze statue is close to the southern entrance. Turn east off Georgia Street to take the 9-km (51/2-mile)	drive	looping the park. More bracing is the Sea Wall Promenade, where you can walk, jog, or ride a bicycle (available for rent at the park entrance). Passing the immaculate green playing field of Brockton Oval, you may spot a cricket game, reminding you this is British Columbia. A splendid group of Haida and Kwakiutl totem poles nearby illustrate the province’s other important cultural influence. On your way to Brockton Point, listen for the 9 o’clock gun, a cannon that fires at 9pm, originally to warn fishermen of the fishing curfew. Turning west, you’ll pass on the seaward side a bronze statue oddly named Girl in a Wet Suit, a version of Copenhagen’s mermaid designed not to shock. Stop off at Prospect Point for a good view of oil tankers and grain cargo ships bound for Japan, China, or Russia.	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	1	43040	2	0.04417517539066185	gpt2_base_gpt2_xl

Baetica (southern Spain). This geographical context explains the strategic importance of Castro Marim, a fortress town occupied by the Moors for five centuries. A little to the south, the sleepy but quietly dignified town of Vila Real de Santo António (the Royal Town of St. Anthony) is the last of the Algarve’s beach towns before Spain. The town was built from scratch in just five months in 1774, aping the grid layout of Lisbon’s Baixa (lower city). The town square, Praça do Marquês do Pombal, is the tour de force of Vila Real, with black-and-white pavement radiating from an obelisk in the center of the square like rays from the sun. Vila Real de Santo António’s main appeal is the ferry to Ayamonte across the water in Spain. The trip takes just 20 minutes — less time than it would take to	drive	to and over the new bridge — and the white town of Ayamonte is a fine sight as you approach it from the river. Crossing into Spain, you will need to take your passport. North from Sagres, along the west coast, is the one part of the Algarve that may well escape intensive development, simply because, although the beaches are pleasant and the coastline dramatic, the water is colder and the wind stronger. For those interested in surfing or solitude, this coast may be ideal. Aljezur’s ruined Moorish castle looks over the town, which makes a good base for neighboring beaches, such as the enormous rocky cove at Arrifana and the wider dune beach of Monte Clerigo, both of which also have their own small tourist complexes. Further north, Odeceixe is a pretty village set in a small river valley, whic	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt	1	43084	2	0.23185282560111775	gpt2_large_gpt

Mealtimes and similar occasions for family togetherness open special conversational doors. Because all family members are present, dinner talk can convey to children a sense of family coherence and identity.101 Most of us can still recapture the stories our parents told us, in which social and moral lessons were powerful and abundant. Here is one my mother told me, recalled in vivid detail nearly a half century later: “Once, when your grandfather was 16 years old, he	came	home weeping, his hands all bloody from working in the factory. His mother, your great grandmother, wiped away his tears and said, ‘Don’t cry, one day you’ll own that factory.’ And by the time he was 30, he did.” Dinnertime recaps of daily events also permit today’s children, isolated from the adult world of real work, to gain access to their parents’ daily lives.

usually dinner—are special social contexts for families in complex societies. They are among the few occasions in which parents and children regularly gather after spending most of the day apart and in which the main family activity is relating to one another. Hence, mealtime talk overﬂows with opportunities for socialization. Mealtimes and similar occasions for family togetherness open special conversational doors. Because all family members are present, dinner talk can convey to children a sense of family coherence and identity.101 Most of us can still recapture the stories our parents told us, in which social and moral lessons were powerful and abundant. Here is one my mother told me, recalled in vivid detail nearly a half century later: “Once, when your grandfather was 16 years old, he	came	home weeping, his hands all bloody from working in the factory. His mother, your great grandmother, wiped away his tears and said, ‘Don’t cry, one day you’ll own that factory.’ And by the time he was 30, he did.” Dinnertime recaps of daily events also permit today’s children, isolated from the adult world of real work, to gain access to their parents’ daily lives.

The Maya These people’s ancestors	arrived	in Central America many thousands of years ago. Small bands of Asiatic hunters migrated across the Bering Strait land bridge before 12,000 b.c. and gradually spread southwards through the Americas. During the Archaic period (after 5,200 b.c.), these people settled in what is now modern Mexico. They developed a primitive agriculture, domesticating cattle and cultivating corn, beans, chili peppers, and squash (a pumpkin-like vegetable) in burned clearings in the jungle. Over time, a society developed that was so successful they could devote time to activities other than simple food cultivation. These people, known as the Olmec, are considered to be the first Mesoamerican culture, the one from which all others evolved. They developed a calendar based on a 52-year cycle.

Many of the old and confined Victorian enclosures where the animals were kept have been redeveloped in the 1990s to create more fitting environments for their majestic and healthy-looking animals. The Planetarium and other areas of Artis offer fun ways to learn about the world around us and are entertaining for adults and children alike. Southeast of Artis, across two canals and busy roads, is Oosterpark, an open green area with a lake and play areas (we would suggest taking a tram — numbers 9 and 14 — rather than	walking	here from the city center). In the northern corner of the park is the Tropenmuseum, once the home of the Dutch Colonial Institute. The building itself was built in 1926 and built especially to house the institute’s collection of artifacts from the tropics.Today the aim of the museum is to improve our knowledge of the world’s tropical areas, and promotes an understanding of the peoples in these developing parts of the world. A vast collection of artifacts from the former Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) was the starting point for the displays, which range from tribal masks to tools and utensils in daily use. Recreations of a Bombay street and Arab souk, among other locales, bring home the reality of life in these very different societies. The museum also has a Kindermuseum (Children’s Museu	walk	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	2	45358	2	0.1392343679975428	gpt2_large_roberta

oin the make-believe trip to Sea World was partly due to the way she approached them—by asking if they’d like to go. By experimenting with language during play, children can see how others react to various styles of communication and use that information to reﬁne their way of speaking. In this way, play is an ideal arena for mastering all aspects of conversational dialogue. Opportunities to acquire literacy-relevant skills also abound in make-believe play. In one kindergarten, children transformed the block-building area into a make-believe recycling center with the help of their teacher. Signs were prepared that advertised the new center, its hours, and what it would pay for various goods. As in other friendly businesses, attendants wore nametags, such as “Hi, I’m Charles!” When customers	arrived	with goods, the attendants had to ﬁll out receipts listing each item, its quantity, and its value. Since many children could not yet spell, they used ﬁrst letters or drew pictures of items. While doing so, they often became curious about how to write the full word and asked the teacher to help them. What does research say about the role of make-believe in children’s literacy development? The amount of time children devote to pretending at age 4 is positively related to reading and writing skills after entering kindergarten and ﬁrst grade—speciﬁcally, the extent to which children spontaneously read words on game cards and signs, understand print concepts, and write letters and simple words.29 The more children engage in literacy-relevant play (activities like the recycling center), the more	arrive	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	3	40521	2	0.11579135254008566	gpt2_med_gpt

At the southern tip, just before it turns west to Sagres, are the coast’s most spectacular sights. Ponta da Piedade (Point of Piety) is the mother of all stack and cliff formations along the Algarve, a stunning terracotta family of bridges, terraces, and grottoes. There is no beach here, but there are great views from above, and in season (spring to autumn) boat trips depart from the foot of the long stairways that have been cut deep into the sides of the cliff. For a complete change of scenery, take a	drive	northwest towards the hills and Bensafrim. Here you can enjoy the Algarve of yesteryear and rolling undeveloped countryside, where people still live off the land. The tilled soil, a startling ochre color, makes a colorful backdrop for orange and lemon groves. Turn off towards the Barragem da Bravura, a dam, and you’ll be rewarded with a sight every bit as inspiring as its name. This water, more akin to the English Lake District than sunny southern Europe, is also of great practical use, irrigating crops, including rice, around Lagos. A new road connects with the old EN 125 route and will undoubtedly open up this relatively undeveloped area. portimão and environs	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt	1	43000	2	0.08018362703497817	gpt2_med_gpt2_xl
Not far from the museum is one of Santiago’s best places to get sweaty in the evening. The Casa de las Tradiciones, a “cultural center” in a sweet little pink house (Calle General Lacret, 651), has live music and as much dancing as its tiny space will allow. It’s great fun, and the locals usually outnumber the tourists. Just west of the Padre Pico steps (south of the train station) is the one-room César Escalante cigar factory, unimpressive by comparison with other Cuban cigar factories but still an enjoyable place to visit, and the Ron Caney rum factory. The oldest rum distillery in the country, it was established in 1838 by Don Facundo Bacardí (whose descendants fled the country in 1959) and nationalized the following year. The rum produced here now	goes	under the name “Havana Club.” You can visit only a small museum and bar.

the church, I took out my cell phone and called the police. “I need to file a missing persons report. …Rachel Frieze. Last night, walking on West 2nd street around – maybe eleven or twelve o’clock. What? …But, sir, this is an unusual situation. She didn’t come home last night, none of her friends have seen her. …Sir, if she’s in any danger, it will probably be too late to help her by that time. My girlfriend has disappeared, I don’t even know where to start looking, and I need help! …Yes, sir. I understand.” The police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight. I closed the phone. Walking out of the church, a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise. A cold front must have hit while I was inside. Glancing down the street, I realized that I didn’t have a friend to	drive	me home this time, and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran. I pulled my T-shirt’s sleeves down my arms as far as they’d go, but I wasn’t ready for cold. Walking didn’t build up much heat; it just moved the air enough to chill me more. After I’d walked about a block, a car rolled up behind me. It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry. This wasn’t the best of neighborhoods. I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it.	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	masc_written	written	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	1	46825	2	0.0980952947700785	gpt2_med_gpt2_xl

keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability. And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military. It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious. I don't disagree with that. I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete. That's what we did in Haiti. There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now. And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy. That's really about all we can do. But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to	come	across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there. And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose. And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended. I certainly agree with that. And that's why I've supported building up our capacity. I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed. I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does. We've had some disagreements about that. He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say. But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.

This custom is not particular to the Chicano community, and nativity scenes can be found throughout the country during the Christmas season. It is thought that Saint Francis of Assisi is the saint responsible for much of the veneration of the infant Jesus, and the custom of creating nativity scenes or monuments to the birth of Christ has been going on for hundreds of years.

The Central Area There are several approaches to Las Cañadas National Park and Mount Teide. The park is well sign-posted from the road via La Orotava, but if you are	coming	from the north, then the most picturesque route is via La Esperanza. The small town soon gives way to a lush forest of giant pines and eucalyptus trees. Four km (21⁄2 miles) south at Las Raíces is where Franco met with his co-conspirators in 1936 (see page 20). An obelisk in the forest commemorates the event. As the road gains altitude and temperatures fall, the views become ever more spectacular. The Mirador Pico de las Flores looks out over to the southeast and the Mirador de Ortuño offers a panorama of the northern coast. Highest of all at over 2,000 m (6,562 ft), Mirador las Cumbres reveals Teide in all her glory. The entrance to the National Park is El Portillo de las Cañadas, where there is a visitor center (open daily 9am–4pm).

treet, the military highway that founder John Simcoe thrust north from the fort to Lake Simcoe, starts out now as downtown Toronto’s main commercial artery. Its intersection at the elegant shopping thoroughfare, Bloor Street, is the fashionable hub of the city. Following John Simcoe’s military grid pattern, Toronto’s main arteries run from the lakefront north: Spadina and University Avenues, Bay, Yonge, and Church Streets; and east–west: Front, King, Queen, Dundas, College-Carlton, and Bloor Streets. Our sightseeing itinerary starts down at the waterfront and works north through the business district to the chic shopping and museum area. As an alternative, especially if you have children, you may prefer to start downtown, around Union Station, and visit the other sights to the north before	coming	back to relax among the recreational attractions of the waterfront. Getting around the city is quite simple, but while downtown, park your car and walk or use the buses or subway.

Nanchang, Jiangxi Province. Founded in the Han Dynasty, Nanchang is the provincial capital and main industrial center of the subtropical Jiangxi Province. In 1927 it was the setting for the first Communist-led armed uprising against the Nationalist forces. A number of relics of Zhou Enlai and other leaders of the Nanchang Uprising have been preserved in the city’s museum, which is devoted to the insurrection. Ningbo (Ningpo), Zhejiang Province. Situated down the coast from Shanghai, this port town has a long history of overseas connections. First it was involved in trade with Japan. Then the Portuguese	arrived	and settled here. Finally, a British consulate was established in the town after the end of the Opium Wars. The sights include a thousand-year-old wooden temple and a Ming Dynasty library in a pretty garden. Qufu (Chufu), Shandong Province. The birthplace of Confucius has been turned into an architectural ensemble on the scale of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The memorial temple was begun in 478 b.c., the year after the philosopher’s death, and improvements and expansions went on for another 2,000 years. The compound itself contains ceremonial gateways, palaces, pavilions, and shrines. The tombs of Confucius and most of his descendants are set among ancient pines and cypress to the north of the town.	arrive	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	3	40706	2	0.2738090248864852	gpt_roberta

ian design, a polygon shape developed by German engineers at the time. The gunning placements held “disappearing” guns, which could not be seen from land or sea. Other gunning placements were also added by US engineers during World War II. A sturdy caponier (a small fortified room with openings for rifles) was to act as a last defense if the battlements were overrun. It was never needed, as the fort never saw any action, and today the ramparts offer panoramic views of Great Sound. There are 9 hectares (22 acres) of grassland all around the fort where you can enjoy a picnic. Just beyond the fort, watch out for a narrow lane to the right with a sign for the Heydon Trust Chapel. This simple place of worship, on land set aside for personal reflection, is open at all hours for those who want to	come	and pray. (The building is listed on maps of 1616 as a personal residence.) Visitors can admire the architecture and see the old water storage tank that collects water for use inside. The village of Somerset lies only half a mile beyond the fort. It is a small settlement but has many shops that are branches of larger Hamilton stores and also a couple of well-regarded restaurants for a leisurely lunch.	come	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt	1	42104	2	0.029511569735240703	gpt_txl

Mojado (Wetback) A translation of the word “wetback,” sometimes spelled moja’o, which literally simply means “wet.” It is a pejorative expression, although it is sometimes used by Mexican people to describe themselves and their experience of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to	come	to the United States. Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos, with the same prejudicial meaning as “greaser” or “spic.” Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants. Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called “wets.” Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels. In Mexico, the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas, a literal translation for the word wetback. In 1955 a well--established Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas, which intended to persuade Mexicans not to go to the United States. It was a political film that incorporated all of the standard	come	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt	1	41535	2	0.38623065548040164	roberta_bert_base

If the workforce at large can learn, what are the social arrangements that best sustain new learning? Leaving the determination of what is to be learned to a few senior managers? Knowing what is best for people or trusting that they might know, or at least contribute to knowing, what is best for themselves? Having people trapped by deferred rewards (Williamson, 1975), or acknowledging that those rewards systems are grounded in distrust? A colleague recently visited the Czech republic, and explored that country’s relatively rapid adjustment to a market economy. She asked what was the single best thing a Czech worker could do to learn the underlying principles of the market. ‘Work for McDonalds,’	went	the surprising reply, ‘but only for six months.’ It was explained that six months was quite long enough for the uninitiated worker to appreciate the importance of customers and customer service. After six months, the worker had learned what he or she could and it was time, from a career perspective, to move on. The contrast between working for McDonalds for six months or working for McDonalds for a lifetime is, writ large, the contrast between boundaryless careers and their traditional bounded counterparts. Today’s work is increasingly ‘intelligent’ work (Quinn, 1992), that calls on workers’ learning capacities, and – as our examples suggest – provides an organising structure rich in project opportunities through which learning episodes can unfold. If that organising structure is lacking, t	go	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	masc_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_CUP2.txt	3	47660	2	0.3147952249697018	roberta_bert_large
Nationhood and Citizenship As much as Lincoln sought to evoke a consciousness of American nationhood, this idea did not readily resonate in the minds of lawyers. The word “nation” was not used in the postbellum amendments. I doubt if it even occurred to counsel for the butchers to	come	into court and argue that independent tradesmen had a right, granted to them by the American nation, to practice their trade without the duty to pay tolls and use specific facilities. Their rights derived, if from anyplace, from universal principles governing the free market and dignity of working people. Yet, this very argument—that the nation was the source of rights acquired under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments—would show itself, remarkably, in a majestic dissenting opinion in 1883.17 The idea of the American nation may have been in the air in the 1870s, but it was not part of the stock of concepts that the Court would draw on directly to domesticate its abstract sense of justice. The concept of an American nation was part of the American creed, but it had yet to be	come	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	1	41559	2	0.46941200299337266	roberta_bert_base

Start at King’s Square on the waterfront. Originally known as “Market Square,” it was the center of all activity for the town. Here you will find the Tourist Information office, whose helpful staff will be able to supply you with information about the day’s activities. On the east side of the square is the Town Hall, which dates from 1782. Although relatively young by St. George’s standards, it has wonderful cedar wood floors and ceilings. Here you can find out about the previous lord mayors and view a commemorative “Charles and Diana” signature, harkening back to happy times. At the northwest corner of the square is the Bermuda Museum of the National Trust. This 17th-century building was constructed by Governor Samuel Day, who	arrived	from England, found the old governor’s house in disrepair, and built this house using government land and government wood — yet he refused to hand over the house when he was ousted from office after only two years. The house became a hotel, the Globe, in the mid-19th century but attracted notoriety again in the early 1860s when it became the office of a Confederate agent during the US Civil War. In 1952, the house was acquired by the Bermuda Historical Monuments Trust and was opened as a museum in 1961, with substantial refurbishment in 1996. On the ground floor, pride of place is given to a detailed model of Somers’s ship, Sea Venture. Many American visitors are also fascinated by a replica of a machine commissioned by the Congress of the Confederate States that stamped a seal for all thei	arrive	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt	3	40689	2	0.24495247411091092	roberta_bert_large

terly of the Archipiélago de los Canarreos, might be your Caribbean paradise — if all you’re looking for is a dazzling white beach and clear blue seas. Other than the miles of beaches, there’s not much else of consequence here except mangrove, scrub, and half a dozen comfortable hotels with a full program of entertainment and watersports. Turtles nest in the sand at one end of the island. At the other you can go sailing, diving, or deep-sea fishing or take a boat trip to Playa Sirena, an incomparable strip of sand a 10-minute boat ride away, where lobster lunches are available. Cayo Largo, with its captive tourist audience, is considerably more expensive than the mainland. Some package tourists spend the whole of their holiday on Cayo Largo. Those with low boredom thresholds might consider	coming	for only a daytrip or for overnight trips on half-hour flights from Havana and Varadero. The Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Youth) is Cuba’s largest offshore island, some 50 km (31 miles) in diameter, but not its prettiest. It is said to have been the location for Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island; pirates once buried their booty here. The island received its jaunty name in the 1970s, when as many as 22,000 foreign students (mainly from politically sympathetic African countries) studied here in no fewer than 60 schools.	come	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt	2	42765	2	0.09940502997283024	roberta_txl

The Sotavento Coast Heading east from the provincial capital of Faro, the first settlement of any size you will	come	to is the colorful fishing town of Olhão. Olhão used to be described as the “little white Cubist town of the Algarve,” its architecture likened to that of North African towns. The parish church (which also goes by the name of Nossa Senhora do Rosário) was founded by King Dom Pedro II in 1698. The small chapel at the rear, Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos (Our Lady of the Afflicted), is where women often pray when their fishermen husbands are away at sea. Instead of the red-tiled roofs and filigreed chimneys seen elsewhere in the Algarve, the Olhão skyline comprises flat-topped roofs of terraces called açoeitas. The Olhão fish market is one of the Algarve’s best, especially famous for its mussels and other shellfish.	come	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt	1	42195	2	0.016549512965690176	txl_txl

The Spanish conducted the first Catholic mass in Mexico here after their arrival in 1518, but they had little interest in the island. It remained almost uninhabited through the 18th century. But following the War of the Castes in 1847–1848, several rebel families settled here to escape retribution by colonial landowners on the Yucatecan mainland. They eked out a simple living for decades until the invention of the scuba tank. And the rest, as they say, is history! Cozumel has multiple personalities; it caters to divers who	go	to bed early and rise with the sun, yet it also has occasionally raucous nightlife for those who want to stay out and party. Those who know the island well refer to this phenomenon as the “wet” side and the “dry” side. Day-trippers who arrive on their huge floating cruise ships — or on daily ferries from Playa del Carmen — add an extra dimension; they want to see everything in a few hours, so the slow routine of island life speeds up when they arrive. There is only one settlement, the capital, on Cozumel, San Miguel de Cozumel; it’s a bustling town chock-full of souvenir shops, duty-free emporiums, bars, and assorted cafés and restaurants. If you arrive on the island by ferry from the mainland, you’ll be dropped off directly opposite the heart of the downtown area, Plaza del Sol, also calle	go	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt	1	44118	2	0.16776592726486433	txl_distilbert

ence of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to come to the United States. Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos, with the same prejudicial meaning as “greaser” or “spic.” Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants. Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called “wets.” Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels. In Mexico, the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas, a literal translation for the word wetback. In 1955 a well--established Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas, which intended to persuade Mexicans not to	go	to the United States. It was a political film that incorporated all of the standard characters that would appear in countless other films and novels of the Chicano experience: the wetback, the pocho (half Mexican), the coyote (smuggler) who smuggles people into the United States, and the grower Mister Sterling. An ironic, yet justified ending shows Mister Sterling dumped into the Rio Grande by Mexicans, and as he swims to the U.S. side of the border he is shot by the Border Patrol. In a 1998 article Herrera-Sobek discusses the use of corridos in several Mexican films that depict the plight of the illegal immigrant, or el mojado.

We have beginning mathematical models that reveal something about this hierarchical organization = although the best current models are curiously limited despite their brilliance. Walter Fontana is a theoretical chemist trained by Peter Schuster in Vienna. Walter	came	to the Santa Fe Institute and made a major intellectual step called “Alchemy.” In chapter 2, I described the emergence of autocatalytic sets of molecular species in a chemical reaction graph. By rather independent intellectual routes that began with physicist John McCaskill’s eVorts to create a computer soup of Turing machines that “operated” on one another, Walter invented “algorithmic chemistry.” Naturally, and most naturally in Santa Fe, where one can be healed by means known nowhere else in the universe, Walter nicknamed algorithmic chemistry “Alchemy.” Unlike the alchemy of Newton’s time, Walter’s works. Here is alchemy: Walter borrowed a computer language known as “lisp.” Lisp expressions can operate on one another.

f the empire). By 1880, amid the industrial expansion of the Gründerzeit (founding years), the city’s population soared past the million mark. Berlin boomed as the center of Germany’s machine industry and was a perfect market for mass-circulation newspapers and big department stores such as KaDeWe (Kaufhaus des Westens), founded in 1907. After that philistine period of rapid growth, the city at last began to assume its place as Germany’s cultural as well as political capital, with Berlin artists Max Liebermann, Lovis Corinth, and Max Slevogt challenging Munich’s dominance of German painting. The Berlin Philharmonic asserted an international prestige, attracting Tchaikovsky, Strauss, and Grieg as guest composers, and in 1905, the great Viennese director Max Reinhardt	arrived	to head the Deutsches Theater. Among its scientists, Robert Koch won a Nobel prize for his discovery of the Tuberculosis bacillus, and Max Planck headed the new Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science (later named the Max-Planck-Institut), with Albert Einstein as director of the physics department.	arrive	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt	3	40687	1	0.34588979239611667	bert_base

The Neo-Gothic Basilica of Notre-Dame (Sussex at Guigues) was born with the capital. The Catholic cathedral’s steeples went up in 1858, though the whole church was not completed until 1890.

Turn off on St. Patrick Street to	drive	through Nepean Point Park to a statue of Samuel de Champlain, founder of Québec, who looks west along the Ottawa River with his Huron Indian scout.

Where the road crosses over the Rideau River and Green Island, look for Rideau Falls, pouring its double “curtain” (French rideau) of water into the Ottawa River.

1. Joint Problem Solving, Aimed at Keeping the Child in the “Zone.” Sydney and her father collaborate in overcoming obstacles that Sydney encounters. In doing so, father and daughter jointly work toward successful puzzle solution. Sydney’s father keeps the task within Sydney’s “zone” by temporarily reducing the diculty of the puzzle. He does so by breaking the task into smaller units, focusing Sydney’s attention on the lower section—the part with the largest and most easily matched pieces. Then he assists with a general prompt, “Which piece might	go	down here?” When Sydney’s father observes that this suggestion is not sucient for her to succeed, he oers additional support, “Find a piece that looks like this shape and matches this color” and “Turn it.” His statements contain strategies (attending to color and shape, patiently adjusting pieces so they ﬁt) that Sydney can use in future attempts. When Sydney experiments with the color-matching strategy and succeeds in placing the brown piece, she internalizes the technique. She applies it in subsequent eorts, regulating her behavior with self-directed language resembling her father’s communication during joint problem solving.

e Trees), the ceremonial courtyard of the old mosque with its original ablutions fountains. The minaret, dating from 1184, was preserved as the bell tower of the cathedral; this celebrated Giralda tower is Sevilla’s most famous landmark. The exterior is beautifully decorated with typical sebka design work. It contrasts vividly with the bland interior, where a series of 35 gently elevating ramps lead to an observation platform at a height of 70 m (230 ft). Ferdinand III rode his horse to the top following the Reconquista in 1248. This is the finest mirador in Sevilla, and provides for unparalleled views of the old city below. It is surprising to note just how large the Plaza de Toros is when seen at this angle. Look up and you will see how the tower	came	by its name. In 1356, an earthquake destroyed the original ornamental top. And it wasn’t until 1558 that the addition of the huge bells and a weather vane (Giralda in Spanish) in the form of a statue of a beautiful goddess representing Faith, raised the height to 98 m (322 ft). The Alcázar (entrance on far side of the square, through the Puerta del León) is a major monument to mid-14th century Mudéjar architecture, combining Moorish, Gothic, and Renaissance elements. Built by Moorish craftsmen under Christian rule, during the reign of Pedro the Cruel, the rambling palace and its several courtyards incorporate fragments of an earlier Moorish fortress, and blend Christian motifs with Moorish designs.

Old San Juan Old San Juan is without doubt one of the most spectacular sights of the Caribbean. Founded in 1521, it is partially surrounded by walls and fortifications that have protected it from modernization and indiscriminate development. The carefully preserved historic houses and public buildings retain many of the most charming features of the original Spanish colonial architecture. Cobblestone streets (the stones were brought as ballast on the Spanish ships, which	went	home filled with treasure and gold), tiny squares, and grand plazas surprise visitors at every turn as they wander the neat grid of streets planned four centuries ago. Only eight blocks wide, San Juan can easily be covered on foot, though there are some steep ascents that may be challenging in the Caribbean heat. Even if you only have one day, you’ll be able to enjoy its delights. If possible, however, take at least a couple of days. Enjoying a rest in a shady plaza or taking a long lunch at an outdoor café are just as much a part of your trip as a tour around the museums. San Juan is a living city, and it’s especially bustling after dark, when crowds throng to the bars and restaurants or simply stroll the narrow streets and airy plazas.	go	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	3	45740	1	0.21018500421065783	bert_base

The Golden Age With the triumph of Christianity, the country was united under the Catholic Monarchs (Los Reyes Católicos), a title conferred by Pope Alexander VI on Ferdinand II of Aragón and Isabella I of Castile. Also in 1492, Cristobal Colón (Christopher Columbus) discovered the New World in the name of the Spanish crown. Fanatical in their religious zeal, the king and queen expelled all Jews who refused to convert to Christianity in the same year, and the Moors followed in 1502. The rulers thus reneged on the promise of religious freedom they had given when Granada surrendered. With the Jews who left Spain	went	many of the country’s bankers and merchants, and with the Moors, a good number of its agriculturists and laborers. The converted Jews (conversos) and Moors (Moriscos) who remained in Spain were viewed with suspicion by the Inquisition, which had been established by the Catholic Monarchs to stamp out heresy. Many were condemned to death, and still more fled the country to escape persecution. The 16th century was glorious for Spain, with the conquest of the New World bringing much prestige and wealth. In 1503, the Casa de Contratación in Sevilla was awarded a monopoly on trade with Spain’s territories in the Americas. For more than two centuries, Sevilla was the richest city in Spain.	go	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt	3	45729	1	0.6913372879959259	bert_large

inction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera. But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. With the horse	went	the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. With the car came paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. Most firms die young, some last a long time. We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions.

y of Hanuman Dhoka Palace. The palace, which now serves primarily as a museum, takes its name from the red-cloaked figure of the monkey god Hanuman that stands to the left of the main palace entrance. This stone statue was erected in 1672 and stands atop a squat pillar. The statue’s face is entirely obscured by red paste that is smeared on by worshippers. Tour guides say the red paste is to spare Hanuman the sight of the goings-on — more acrobatic than erotic — carved on the struts of the small Jaganath Temple opposite. When this bit of mythology is related, it immediately sends tour groups trotting across to see what is forbidden to the monkey god. Some say the carvings are there for protection, because the goddess of lightning is a virgin who would not	come	near anything so shocking. The erotica is probably best explained, however, along with Nepal’s ubiquitous Shiva lingams (phalluses) and the female yoni symbols, as an expression of the creative energy in male-female relations and the pleasure principles of Tantrism. In the palace wall beyond the Hanuman statue and protected by a wooden fence is a poem etched in stone in 15 languages dated 14 January 1664. It is attributed to King Pratap Malla, reputed to be a great linguist.	come	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	1	42179	1	0.6108600873781752	bert_large

nts.13 The key provisions of these amendments define political membership, articulate basic rights, and provide an ambit of legislative competence. So reformed, the American system of government would be able to protect individual rights as well as promote the equality of all persons who survived the war. Of course, we must assume a set of institutions—a Congress, an Executive, and a Judiciary—that will continue to function according to the terms of their initial creation. Still, there is something missing in this filtering off of the three Reconstruction Amendments and calling them a separate constitution. The missing factor is the consciousness of setting forth a new framework of government, a structure based on values fundamentally different from those that	went	before. To find that consciousness, we need to turn, I wish to argue, to the critical message of the Civil War, the address that would generate a new normative world in which to make sense of the epic war that consumed America from the firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox.

s cut into a steep mountainside. According to island lore, the daughters of noble families spent their youth in these small cells serving the native gods. At the age of 15 they were allowed to marry or to remain in the sanctuary for life. More prosaically, the caves were probably also used for grain storage. Around this area, you could spy some modern cave dwellers. Continue south towards Agaete, which is the most attractive of the small northern towns. Agaete’s port, Puerto de las Nieves, is a haven of calm among the formidable rocky cliffs that make up this inhospitable stretch of coast.

at’s some 100 billion gallons (450 billion liters) of water. The animals that live here are also amazing. This is one of the last habitats of the threatened Puerto Rican parrot. The infamous coquí (see page 47)is, of course, heard everywhere. All in all, the park in an impressive sight, with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance. Arriving via Route 191 you’ll come right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park. This facility presents important information about the history of the park, its plant and animal species, and its role in the local ecology. You can then travel on higher into the park, toward the summit. You can’t	drive	the whole 8 miles (13 km) between the visitors center and the end of the road, but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way, so there’s ample access. Two popular stops are La Coca Falls, on the right after the 5-mile (8-km) point, and the Yokahú Observation Tower, at the 51⁄2-mile (9-km) point. Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes. The most spectacular cascade in the park, La Mina Falls, is just a 30-minute walk from the roadside, via Big Tree Trail. Take a walk on any of the well-marked trails: the atmosphere is humid and the vegetation constantly damp (your best friends will be your insect repellent and your stout shoes), but the landscape is beautiful and fascinating.	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	1	43086	1	0.4042156790521538	bert_large

les have been important community social and cultural events. In Texas, New Mexico, and California, because of the isolation of the communities, dancing became the principal source of entertainment. The social status of women in Spanish colonial society was limited and cloistered, with their primary social venues consisting of church and home. El baile provided entertainment and physical activity. As an early California traveler put it, “I was astonished at the endurance of the California women in holding out, night after night, in dancing, of which they never seemed to weary, but kept on with an appearance of freshness and elasticity that was as charming as surprising” (Shay 100). It was at el baile that courtship occurred (since girls, although they may have	gone	to the dance chaperoned, were allowed to dance with boys); it was at el baile that families and relatives interacted, that the week’s work was forgotten, and that life’s mysteries were discussed. The local dance brought the community together and allowed interaction between the sexes. A girl was never able to reject a request to dance from a boy, because to turn down an invitation exposed the boy to embarrassment and ridicule for his failure in competition, and could be cause for revenge. Countless corridos (ballads), leyendas (legends), and chistes (jokes) narrate events that are supposed to have occurred at el baile, from fights to courtships to elopements. Encounters with the legendary weeping woman, La Llorona, often occur after a dance when a solitary man is fin	go	gone	come	driven	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt	5	44780	1	0.27970623061627614	bert_large

ath areas surrounding Puerto Vallarta and Huatulco. For details in Huatulco contact Cantera Tours (Tel. (9) 581-0030); in Puerto Vallarta call Pathfinders at Chico’s Dive Shop (Tel. (3) 222-1875). If you like the adventure of traveling through the jungle, Vallarta Adventure in Puerto Vallarta, offers an extraordinary tour of the Sierra Madre Mountains on board Mercedes Benz all-terrain vehicles (called Unimogs). The tour includes a visit to a secluded beach and a detailed explanation of the flora and fauna of the area. Lovers of speed and thrill-seekers will enjoy the fast-paced tour along the Papagayo River, 72 km (48 miles) north of Acapulco. Shotover-Jet (Tel. (7) 484-1154), travels aboard specially-designed 12-passenger turbo boats, which	come	screaming up to the face of the canyon, and then make a fast spin before continuing up the river, while making repeated 360° turns. To say that it’s a rush is an understatement, and their eco-conscious pamphlet is good for a chuckle, considering the reality of the experience. They are, however, making new rafting excursions available for those who prefer to experience the Papagayo River a little closer to its natural state.

—Jeff Kernodle, Vice President for Replenishment, VF Corp Many of the popular accounts of quick response, rapid replenishment, and supply-chain management assume that all parties—consumers, retailers, and suppliers—win as a result of these policies. Consumers have definitely benefited because these practices afford them a greater choice of products at lower average prices.1 It is safe to say that lean retailers have also	come	out ahead, given their rapid growth in relation to, and at the expense of, traditional retailers in many different retail channels. But have suppliers benefited from entering into relations with lean retailers? Have such firms improved their competitive position along with the retailers they supply? The short answer to these questions is “It depends.” Although it is certainly true that a supplier gains from successful customers, the degree to which such a company actually benefits has much to do with its internal manufacturing choices.

Entertainment Once the sun	goes	down, Cancún gears up. There’s no shortage of places to go or things to do, and no need to take a long novel to fill those quiet moments — there just won’t be any. Many people don’t take to their beds until they’ve seen the sun come up. If you choose to stay in Mujeres or Cozumel, things will be a bit more laid back. The diving fraternity tends to enjoy low-key, less glamorous entertainment and relatively early nights before they head under the waves early the following day. Before you head straight into the resort atmosphere of Cancún, check out what’s happening in your hotel. Many have “Las Vegas style” floor shows, Mexican evenings with traditional folk music and dances, and clubs where you can take to the dance floor yourself.	go	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhatToDo.txt	4	44347	1	0.16679993995343723	distilbert

When adults ask children questions and make suggestions that permit them to participate in the discovery of solutions, then transfer of useful strategies to the child is maximized. By introducing language as a mediator of the child’s activity, the adult’s questions and prompts prevent the child from responding impulsively. They encourage the child to step back from the immediate situation and consider alternatives—in essence, to think. Look at Sydney and her father’s dialogue once again. When he asks, “Which piece might	go	down here?” he evokes Sydney’s present strategic thinking, ﬁnding that it is still tied to immediate objects in the situation. Sydney looks for the clown’s shoes but fails to ﬁnd them. Then her father introduces a special form of strategic thinking called distancing. This method helps children move beyond concrete objects by looking for higher-order relationships—in Sydney’s case, cate	go	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	1	43683	1	0.16539140582108747	distilbert

Mijas Eight kilometers (5 miles) inland from Fuengirola and clinging to the hillside is Mijas. Surrounded by modern villas and urbanizaciones (developments), it looks from the outside like any other quaint village with whitewashed houses. But Mijas is different. Most of the houses have been converted into upscale shops, restaurants, or bars, making the village itself a unique tourist attraction. Traffic is banned from the center, so if you don’t feel like the short	walk	from the parking lot, take a mule taxi. Mijas has Spain’s only square bullring, and across from it, beautifully tended gardens slope down to a cliff-top mirador, with fine views all along the coast. There is another mirador beside the car park. On one side of this natural balcony you will find a tiny chapel dedicated to the Virgen de la Peña (Our Lady of the Mountain), set in a grotto carved from living rock.	walk	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt	1	45194	1	0.18714245410253527	gpt2_base

role played by guns. I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands. Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law. Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun	comes	from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun. What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence. So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws. We added beds. We're tough. We believe in tough love. We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained. And that's what needs to happen. We've got laws. If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important. New question. As I was saying. Both of you -- Governor, both of you have talked much about Medicare and health care for seniors. What about the more than 40 million younger Americans who do not have health insurance right now?

On the River The transcendent tourist experience of Guilin — and perhaps of all China — is a boat trip on the Li River. The karst scenery could hardly be more romantic. But life along the river is also fascinating: washerwomen squatting on the shore, water buffalo ambling down for a dip, the improvised ferryboats, and the captive cormorant birds, their necks ringed to prevent them from swallowing all their catch, waiting for orders to	go	fishing from bamboo rafts. Large, flat-bottomed tour boats usually leave early in the morning from the quay near the Liberation Bridge in central Guilin. (In the dry season, when the river is at its lowest, the first part of the journey must be undertaken by coach.) With room for more than 100 passengers each, most of these vessels are quiet and serve a lunch cooked en route.	go	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	1	44126	1	0.04465205946541961	gpt2_base

I shivered. Something in his tone couldn’t be disbelieved. “Tell me anyway. If she’s in trouble, I want to find her, wherever she is.” My driver took a deep breath. As he did, his neck stretched in a strange way and I noticed several thin lines, like wrinkles, running across the sides of his neck. “Nathan,” he began in the way that people speak when they start a long and difficult explanation, “Rachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet. This person, like me, is not a member of traditional society. You see, Nathan, there is …separate from your society …oh, damn it. I’ve never had to give this conversation before. Come on, I have something to show you.” With that, he made a sharp turn onto a side street that I hadn’t noticed before.

I was content to let myself drift away, and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral’s hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek. A girl’s voice, soft and almost recognizable, spoke, “Nathan.” I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected. Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me the hammer and stake. I stood and turned toward the altar. The vampire was walking just steps ahead of me. I stepped up behind him and raised my hands, which almost seemed to be glowing. Then the stake	came	down into his back and one, two, three strikes with the hammer drove it in. The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth. Behind me, Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys, whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug. I pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar.	come	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	masc_written	written	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	3	46438	1	0.0494090087503416	gpt2_large

n the Republican candidate for president, George W. Bush of Texas, and the Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The format and the rules are those negotiated by representatives of the two campaigns. Only the subjects tonight and the questions are mine. The format tonight is that of a conversation. The only prevailing rule is that no single response can ever, ever exceed two minutes. The prevailing rule for the audience here in the hall is as always, absolute quiet, please. Good evening, Governor Bush, Vice President Gore. The end of our 90 minutes last week in Boston, the total time each of you took was virtually the same. Let's see if we can do the same tonight, or come close. Governor Bush, the first question	goes	to you. One of you is about to be elected the leader of the single-most powerful nation in the world, economically, financially, militarily, diplomatically, you name it. Have you formed any guiding principles for exercising this enormous power? I have, I have. First question is what's in the best interests of the United States? What's in the best interests of our people? When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question. Is it in our nation's interests? Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests. Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests. Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.

When she hadn’t	come	back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn’t see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn’t see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin. The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. He didn’t move, just stared and held his drink.

From Kathmandu, short trips to the valley rim make it possible for those with limited time to see the high mountains at sunrise or sunset. Nagarkot, which stands on the crest of a ridge at 2,195 m (7,200 ft), is about an hour’s	drive	from Bhaktapur and one of the best places in the Kathmandu area for viewing the Himalayas. From this aerie on the rim of the Kathmandu Valley, 322 km (200 miles) of the Himalayas stretch out before you in an immense wall of rock and ice. Although there are excellent views from the many lodges and hotels here, the view is even better from a nearby observation tower, which can be reached in about an hour’s walk from Nagarkot. From this observation tower, it is possible to see as far as Mount Everest. Most visitors come for the sunrise or sunset on the mountains, and though the weather is often at its clearest in the early morning, low clouds and fog often obstruct the view. The Kathmandu area’s other popular mountain-viewing spot is the village of Dhulikhel, which has a view very similar to t	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	1	43078	1	0.05444852317121729	gpt2_med

arents use her name to scare little children into obedience: “Hay viene La Llorona . . . portaté bien” (The Llorona is coming, behave yourself). Even adults who’ve heard the story many times and do not want to admit belief still fear a late-night encounter with La Llorona. There are ancient texts of indigenous mythology narrated by the Aztecs and recorded by the Spaniards that very closely resemble the La Llorona legend. In some tales she is believed to be Cihuacoatl, the patron goddess of women who die in childbirth. It is said that Cihuacoatl carried a little baby cradle on her back, or a dead baby in her arms, as she roamed the country crying through the nights. Those who saw her considered it an ill omen. Sahagún mentions in The Conquest of Mexico that “a woman was often heard [as] she	went	weeping and crying out. Loudly did she call out at night. She walked about saying: ‘O my beloved sons, now we are about to go!’” (Horcasitas and Butterworth, 208). Horcasitas and Butterworth reprint several texts of these early chronicles. Diego Muñoz Camargo (ca. 1529–1599) also reported that before the Spaniards arrived, “many times and many nights was heard the voice of a woman who cried out in a loud voice, drowning herself with her tears, and with great sobs and sighs, wailing” (Horcasitas and Butterworth, 209). Contemporary texts of La Llorona collected in Mexico assert that the original Llorona was La Malinche, the mistress of Cortés. Cortés abandoned her to return to Spain, and according to the legend Malinche killed their son with a knife.

d writing down their traditions. For instance Fabiola Cabeza de Baca, Cleofas Jaramillo, and Nina Otero all wrote about the weddings of northern New Mexico. In her book The Good Life, Fabiola Cabeza de Baca has a brief chapter on wedding traditions, including recipes and a detailed description of the preparation of the food. When a couple married, three main ceremonies took place. These were initiated after the groom and his family had asked the girl’s family for her hand in marriage. If the girl or her family refused the offer, she would send a letter to her suitor with her negative response. This was termed as giving cala-bazas (squash or pumpkin) and was a great insult to the wooer. Of the ceremonies, first there was el día del prendorio (day of the engagement), when the bride and groom	came	together publicly for the first time. A great celebration would take place, usually in the home of the bride, with food, drinks, and music. This festivity would be equivalent to an engagement party. The day of the wedding was called el día del casorio and could last from two to three days. The upper classes held lavish wedding ceremonies that would last for days with lots of music and food for their many guests; the poorer folks also followed many of the same traditions, although in a more modest fashion. It was the tradition that the bridegroom’s family hosted the celebration after the church service. There was always an orchestra that played while the guests ate, and a big dance on the eve of the wedding day. After the dance, or at the conclusion of the feast, there was the entrega de nov	come	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chW.txt	3	40892	1	0.04317548597014542	gpt2_med

Dawson City A day’s	drive	from Whitehorse along the Klondike Highway, the old boomtown counts scarcely 1,000 inhabitants today, but the national parks system has done a nice tongue-in-cheek job of reconstructing the monuments of its heyday. The history of Dawson City is further celebrated by a couple of annual events. This is the place to be in the week of August 17, Discovery Day, for the Klondike River raft-races, costumed street-parades, music, and dancing. If you miss it, look out for the Outhouse-On-Wheels race at the beginning of September. One of the town’s major year-round attractions is Diamond Tooth Gertie’s Gambling Hall, an old-fashioned (and legal) casino, where red-gartered dancing girls kick it up to a honky-tonk piano.

Once a magnet for foreign artists and still home to some, Ubud and the cluster of villages around it form the cultural and artistic focus of Bali. An increasing number of visitors come on day trips from the coastal resorts, but a better plan is to stay overnight or longer. There’s a wide choice of accommodations, ranging from cheap homestays and charming middle range hotels to high-priced luxury hideaways in the countryside just outside Ubud. Day trippers only get to see the commercialism and chaos in Ubud’s main streets. Just a short	walk	away, however, you’re among the green, peaceful rice terraces and jungle-filled river gorges that have captivated Bali’s visitors for decades and are so much a part of the region’s legendary mystique. For schedules of dance performances and other events in the vicinity, pay an early visit to the Bina Wisata information office on Jalan Raya. Excellent, very inexpensive performances of traditional dance are offered in the atmospheric compound beside the palace in the center of town. In addition to its many shops, markets, and galleries, Ubud is home to a number of interesting museums.	walk	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	1	45107	1	0.5743070168290965	gpt2_xl
magine yourself to be exploring where no one except the abundant birds and butterflies has been for centuries. Cobá more than any other site requires sensible footwear, hat, sunscreen, and bottled water, because the principal structures are spread so widely apart. The main building at the site is the Iglesia or church, a huge pyramid nearly 30 m (90 ft) high. It sits among a number of structures known as the Grupo Cobá, which lie to the right of the main entrance. Its major staircase has been cleared, and the view from the top is spectacular, with the lakes and jungle stretching out to cover the land. At irregular intervals, vegetation-covered mounds indicate other pyramids yet to be freed. The only other large structure in view is the stone façade of Nohoch Mul (Big Hill) some 20 minutes’	walk	away. At 42 m (138 ft), Nohoch Mul is the largest Mayan pyramid yet discovered; there are 120 steps to its upper platform. Once there you will find images of the Descending God — the same image seen so often at Tulum. Between the Nohoch Mul group and Grupo Cobá is Conjunto de las Pinturas (Paintings Group) where you can see the Pyramid of the Painted Lintel, which as the name suggests still bears traces of its original coloring.

The North Coast Before the days of flying, most visitors to Bali	arrived	in the north. The first Dutch military expeditions disembarked near Singaraja, which became the island’s administrative capital and the colony’s chief port. Now, almost everyone arrives and stays in southern Bali, and only a fraction of them ever take a trip to the north coast, although the journey takes less than two hours by road. There is quite a contrast between the south and north. It is hotter and drier in the north and far less densely populated. The proportion of Muslims is higher; some of the people are descended from traders and immigrants from other islands. There is only a narrow strip of flat land between the mountains and the sea, or in some places none at all. Cactus plants are as common as palm trees and the small area of rice depends on irrigation.

ah started college, but for her the road to maturity was rough. She had diculty concentrating, earned uneven grades, and accumulated so many incompletes in courses that the university prohibited her from reenrolling until she wrapped up her “unﬁnished business.” Frustrated with Hannah’s undirectedness, her mother withdrew ﬁnancial support and insisted that she get a job. Hannah’s full-time waitressing soon became both an obstacle and an excuse for lack of progress in her studies. “I was at sea,” Hannah recalled. “I didn’t have any conﬁdence in myself, and I didn’t think I could do anything. So I started visiting Aunt Eva and Uncle Charlie, who lived three hours away.” “We hadn’t known Hannah well while she was growing up,” Eva continued, “so we were surprised but delighted when she started	coming	on weekends. It didn’t matter what we were doing—birthday celebrations, dinner with friends, outings to movies and plays, shopping excursions, or leisurely breakfasts; Hannah hungered to be part of our family. During those times, she asked lots of questions about our work and home lives, and also about her parents, especially their early history: ‘Was my mom close to her mom?’ ‘Did you know my mom and dad when they were in college?’ ‘What was my parents’ wedding like?’ I described these and many other earlier events. We also did our best to convince Hannah that believing in herself grows out of trying hard, taking risks, and following through. We talked about how important it was for her to return to school, helped her think through a change of major, and advised on time management and stud	come	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	2	42626	1	0.06288988472887924	gpt2_xl

Niagara-on-the-Lake A meandering 30-km (18-mile) riverside	drive	north along the lovely tree-lined Niagara Parkway takes you from the tumult of the tourist buses to the tranquillity of this old Loyalist bastion. The town, settled by refugees from the American Revolution in 1792 and briefly capital of Upper Canada, jealously preserves an image of a “British” way of life revisited by North American nostalgia. The main street, Queen Street, pays tribute to the Anglo-Saxon myth with its clock tower, white clapboard and red-brick houses, the grand Prince of Wales Hotel, tea shops serving buns and buttered scones, and the lovingly restored Niagara Apothecary (1866) displaying old-fashioned medicine jars in walnut cabinets under ornamental crystal gaslights.

The North Coast Before the days of flying, most visitors to Bali arrived in the north. The first Dutch military expeditions disembarked near Singaraja, which became the island’s administrative capital and the colony’s chief port. Now, almost everyone	arrives	and stays in southern Bali, and only a fraction of them ever take a trip to the north coast, although the journey takes less than two hours by road. There is quite a contrast between the south and north. It is hotter and drier in the north and far less densely populated. The proportion of Muslims is higher; some of the people are descended from traders and immigrants from other islands. There is only a narrow strip of flat land between the mountains and the sea, or in some places none at all. Cactus plants are as common as palm trees and the small area of rice depends on irrigation. The region is also dotted with Bali’s local vineyards.	arrive	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	4	40740	1	0.05717839270357783	gpt2_xl

The American Pioneers The first Americans to come to California from the eastern states were Boston fur traders taking the Cape Horn route at the end of the 18th century. They didn’t stay for long, but gradually other traders and fur trappers began to	arrive	overland through Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, settling only in small numbers until the famous covered wagons began their heroic treks of the 1840s. The hardships the pioneers suffered in the Sierra Nevada mountains, Death Valley, and the Mojave Desert became the stuff of California legend, the most tragic being the fate of 87 pioneers who set out from Illinois in 1846. While attempting to cross the Sierra Nevada, George Donner’s wagon train became snowed in, and from November until February was stuck high in the mountains north of Lake Tahoe, at a point now known as the Donner Pass. Just 47 people survived, and then only by resorting to cannibalism. Just simple farmers seeking a place in the sun to work a piece of land, the pioneers came at a time when territorial expansion was mu	arrive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-History.txt	1	40483	1	0.08446583687959719	gpt

Sweeping eastwards from the gate, this grand 61-m (200-ft) -wide avenue, literally named “Beneath the Linden Trees,” was Berlin’s showcase boulevard. Frederick the Great saw it as the center of his royal capital, and it became the most prestigious address in town. Some of its splendor fell victim to 19th-century building speculation, but the avenue remained fashionable until the bombs of World War II reduced it to rubble. Now the trees have been replanted and the most important buildings restored. Its western end is dominated by the Russian Federation Embassy on the right as you	come	from Brandenburg Gate. Close by is the smartest hotel in town; the supremely elegant Hotel Adlon was recently built on the site of the original hotel of the same name, which was a 1930s Berlin legend. Continuing east, you pass the unprepossessing modern façade of the Komische Oper, one of Berlin’s most important opera companies. The ugly exterior is the result of post-war reconstruction; happily, the magnificently over-the-top original gilded interior has been retained.	come	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	1	42098	1	0.07493802843765818	gpt

ve function of the first quantum system becomes entangled in very complex ways with the other complex quantum system, which may be thought of as the environment. Rather like water waves swirling into tiny granular nooks and crannies along a rugged fractal beach, the initial coherent Schrödinger equation representing the initial quantum system swirls into tiny and highly diverse patterns of interaction with the quantum system representing the environment. The consequence of this intermixing is decoherence.

For most other museums this would be treasure enough, yet in Iráklion there are also impressive Greek and Roman artifacts to enjoy. The museum is a must for those intending to visit the ancient sites, since the objects here add life to the now empty cities and palaces. To fully appreciate all of its glories will take at least a couple of hours — the exquisite detail in painting on pottery and frescoes, and the fine workmanship in jewelry and everyday tools is breathtaking. Try to visit early to avoid the large tour groups who	arrive	in the middle of the day. The 20 rooms are arranged in chronological order, grouping artifacts from each site. Although you will surely find your own favorite pieces, here are some of the highlights you will discover on your tour. Room 1 has the earliest finds, dating from 6000 b.c. (Neolithic and Pre-Palace periods). Many were found at Móchlos on the northeastern coast. Primitive pottery is on display — including a rather naïve clay bull with an acrobat holding one horn — and finer work such as a stone pyxis (jewelry box) incised with geometric patterns and a reclining animal. Room 2 is the first of two rooms displaying finds from the Old-Palace period (2000–1700 b.c.), including the earliest examples of fine Kamáresware pottery with its polychrome decoration, found in the ruins at Knossós	arrive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt	1	40496	1	0.04354581666061175	gpt

his convent is actually a series of Guanche caves cut into a steep mountainside. According to island lore, the daughters of noble families spent their youth in these small cells serving the native gods. At the age of 15 they were allowed to marry or to remain in the sanctuary for life. More prosaically, the caves were probably also used for grain storage. Around this area, you could spy some modern cave dwellers. Continue south towards Agaete, which is the most attractive of the small northern towns. Agaete’s port, Puerto de las Nieves, is a haven of calm among the formidable rocky cliffs that make up this inhospitable stretch of coast.

xistence of new goods and services and extinction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera. But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. With the horse	went	the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. With the car came paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. Most firms die young, some last a long time. We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions. The parallels are at least tantalizing, and	go	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt	3	45533	1	0.9226225837910872	roberta
. More than 30,000 Cubans tried to cross shark-infested waters to Florida on improvised rafts. Facing a dramatic influx of Cubans, President Clinton abolished the US policy of automatic asylum to Cuban refugees, placing them in a makeshift tent settlement in Guantánamo Bay Naval Base. In the opinion of many, Cuba is an isolated socialist dinosaur. Yet it — and its aging leader — soldier on against all odds. The US embargo, denounced by an ever-increasing majority in the United Nations, is spurred on by vehement anti-Castro lobbying by Cubans in southern Florida. Still, changes in the status quo seem likely. But nearly four decades after the Cuban missile crisis, the world continues to wait, wondering whether a lifting of US trade and tourism sanctions or a change in leadership in Cuba will	arrive	first.	arrive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-History.txt	1	40500	1	0.9171636430781229	roberta

of the Reconstruction Amendments.13 The key provisions of these amendments define political membership, articulate basic rights, and provide an ambit of legislative competence. So reformed, the American system of government would be able to protect individual rights as well as promote the equality of all persons who survived the war. Of course, we must assume a set of institutions—a Congress, an Executive, and a Judiciary—that will continue to function according to the terms of their initial creation. Still, there is something missing in this filtering off of the three Reconstruction Amendments and calling them a separate constitution. The missing factor is the consciousness of setting forth a new framework of government, a structure based on values fundamentally different from those that	went	before. To find that consciousness, we need to turn, I wish to argue, to the critical message of the Civil War, the address that would generate a new normative world in which to make sense of the epic war that consumed America from the firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox. The new Nomos, the new framework of values that necessitated a new constitution, comes forth in one of the great prayers of the American civil religion, the Gettysburg Address. It is worth recalling some of the enduring phrases of this civil prayer, the incantations that reverberated in American consciousness: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation. . . .	go	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt	3	45525	1	0.8090344099373664	roberta
at minimal cost, they gathered in ever-increasing numbers. Tales were told in Australia about the “perfect wave,” and Kuta became the dream destination for every surfer. Once a poor fishing village and wasteland believed to be inhabited by bad spirits, by the 1980s it was transformed into a frenetic scene, fueled by plenty of alcohol and, for a while, illegal drugs. The height limit was virtually the only regulation applied to building, and a sprawling shantytown soon sprang up. Theft and prostitution (chiefly blamed on incomers from the other islands) looked as if they were becoming endemic. On and off the beach, every foreigner was plagued by hawkers as adhesive as bush flies. Eventually, voices were heard at banjar meetings urging a clean-up and the raising of standards. Today Kuta has	gone	a long way toward putting its house right. Drugs have largely disappeared and crime rates are down, although you still need to beware of pickpockets and shouldn’t leave property unguarded. Traffic, however, remains Kuta’s nightmare. Kuta, and its progressively upscale neighbors to the north — Legian, Seminyak, and Kerobokan (as well as Tuban, to the south) — provide an enormous selection of hotels, restaurants, pubs, and shopping choices. In all price ranges, you’ll find some of the best Italian, French, Vegetarian, Asian, and Mexican restaurants on the island, as well as some of the best shops for crafts from other islands, fashion, locally produced ikat cloth, and casual Bali-style beach clothing.

and small, in the immediate vicinity of Hanuman Dhoka Palace. The palace, which now serves primarily as a museum, takes its name from the red-cloaked figure of the monkey god Hanuman that stands to the left of the main palace entrance. This stone statue was erected in 1672 and stands atop a squat pillar. The statue’s face is entirely obscured by red paste that is smeared on by worshippers. Tour guides say the red paste is to spare Hanuman the sight of the goings-on — more acrobatic than erotic — carved on the struts of the small Jaganath Temple opposite. When this bit of mythology is related, it immediately sends tour groups trotting across to see what is forbidden to the monkey god. Some say the carvings are there for protection, because the goddess of lightning is a virgin who would not	come	near anything so shocking. The erotica is probably best explained, however, along with Nepal’s ubiquitous Shiva lingams (phalluses) and the female yoni symbols, as an expression of the creative energy in male-female relations and the pleasure principles of Tantrism. In the palace wall beyond the Hanuman statue and protected by a wooden fence is a poem etched in stone in 15 languages dated 14 January 1664. It is attributed to King Pratap Malla, reputed to be a great linguist.	come	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	1	42179	1	0.5696253794412885	roberta

To reach the ancient sites drop down from Agía Vavára on to the Plain. Near the village of Agía Déka — named after ten saints who were martyred here — and widely scattered in farmland, are the remains of Górtis (Gortyn), capital of the island during the Roman era (from 65 b.c.) and also an important city in Minoan times. Górtis is such a huge site — at its height it had a population of 300,000 — that you will see signposts to remains lying in the midst of crops south of the modern road. By all means, stop to enjoy them, or leave the car in the village and	walk	around. You’ll be well-rewarded, with ancient columns resting against olive trees, shards of pottery among the grass blades, and a Governor’s palace and amphitheatre to explore. Stop at the Byzantine church in the village — you’ll find stone from the ancient site used here too — and see the stone execution block of the martyrs. Their tomb can be viewed through the gate of a nearby crypt. The main site (the one with the admission fee) covers only a tiny part of the whole, but it protects one of the most important archaeological finds on the island — the Code of Laws dating from the Dorian period, around 500 b.c. The huge stone tablet was incised with script dictating codes governing daily life including rules on marriage, property, and inheritance rights.

The whole area is a place of staggering proportions: there are over 200 species of native trees. One specimen is said to be over 2,500 years old; some trees are so wide it takes several people to reach around them; others soar hundreds of feet into the air. The forest gets over 180 inches (41���2 m) of rain each year — that’s some 100 billion gallons (450 billion liters) of water. The animals that live here are also amazing. This is one of the last habitats of the threatened Puerto Rican parrot. The infamous coquí (see page 47)is, of course, heard everywhere. All in all, the park in an impressive sight, with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance. Arriving via Route 191 you’ll	come	right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park. This facility presents important information about the history of the park, its plant and animal species, and its role in the local ecology. You can then travel on higher into the park, toward the summit. You can’t drive the whole 8 miles (13 km) between the visitors center and the end of the road, but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way, so there’s ample access. Two popular stops are La Coca Falls, on the right after the 5-mile (8-km) point, and the Yokahú Observation Tower, at the 51⁄2-mile (9-km) point. Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes. The most spectacular cascade in the park, La Mina Falls, is just a 30-minute walk from the roadside, via Big Tree Trail.

Unfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression. It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website. However, the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons: a) Moore clearly states that "before he	came	to Flint", Heston gave an interview. In the excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March. If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers, why would he say this, and show the month the interview was published? b) Why should Moore leave the words "Clinton is on the Today Show" visible in the text, which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part? I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing.	come	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	masc_written	written	#essays#	essays_A_defense_of_Michael_Moore.txt	3	46385	1	0.3496571737947979	roberta

potatoes. Buffaloes and goats are milked, and millet is threshed by pounding the stalks on the threshing floor. Women and girls troop to and from water taps with their water jars, while small children rock babies slung in baskets under the thatched eaves of stone-walled houses. Grain is taken to water-driven mills for grinding, or in some cases is ground between two flat stones or pounded in a mortar by a foot-operated rocker-beam pestle. In recent years numerous hydroelectric projects throughout the Annapurna and Solu-Khumbu regions have brought moderately reliable electricity to remote villages. However, this electricity is usually only available for a few hours in the evening. With electricity available, it is now possible to watch CNN (via satellite dish) from a remote lodge many days’	walk	from the nearest road. If you are trekking in the Annapurna region, you will at times have to give way to caravans of ponies, mules, and donkeys crowned with red and white yak-tail plumes. In the Khumbu region, it will be caravans of yaks themselves (or yak-cow cross breeds) carrying the packs. Give the yaks a wide berth, and always stay on the uphill side of the trail as they pass.	walk	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt	1	45214	1	0.32905314810142483	roberta

chshauptstadt (capital of the empire). By 1880, amid the industrial expansion of the Gründerzeit (founding years), the city’s population soared past the million mark. Berlin boomed as the center of Germany’s machine industry and was a perfect market for mass-circulation newspapers and big department stores such as KaDeWe (Kaufhaus des Westens), founded in 1907. After that philistine period of rapid growth, the city at last began to assume its place as Germany’s cultural as well as political capital, with Berlin artists Max Liebermann, Lovis Corinth, and Max Slevogt challenging Munich’s dominance of German painting. The Berlin Philharmonic asserted an international prestige, attracting Tchaikovsky, Strauss, and Grieg as guest composers, and in 1905, the great Viennese director Max Reinhardt	arrived	to head the Deutsches Theater.

Wharves reach out into Boston Harbor from Downtown and the North End like the fingers on a hand. Once this was the second busiest port in the United States, with clippers jostling for space. Today after a long period of decline, the area has revived and the granite warehouses have been renovated into apartments, restaurants, offices, and hotels. The British sailed home from Long Wharf. Today you can sail to the Harbor Islands, take a cruise around the harbor, or just sit and admire the craft at anchor. On Central Wharf, the New England Aquarium is one of the best anywhere. Its centerpiece is a giant 200,000-gallon tank containing a 24-ft- (7-m-) deep coral reef filled with sharks, sea turtles, and 600 fish from 100 species. Five times a day, scuba divers	go	in to feed the fish, a fascinating spectacle to watch. Ramps circle the tank so that you can walk around the whole thing.

hotel zone. A dozen luxury hotels sprawl amid spacious grounds next to dazzling white beaches, with two championship golf courses, a convention center at the Sheraton Nusa Indah Hotel, and the Galleria, a modern shopping and restaurant complex in the same area. Predictably, lower-priced hotels and affordable eating places line the 5 km (3 miles) of coast north of Nusa Dua’s hotel zone, all the way to Benoa. Once a dusty, somnolent fishing village, Benoa has turned into a watersports center of buzzing jet skis, motorboats, diving centers, and bars. Don’t confuse Benoa village (Tanjung Benoa) with Benoa Port, on the opposite (north) side of the muddy inlet known as Benoa Harbor. Reached from the Sanur-Kuta road by a long causeway, the harbor is where cargo ships tie up. There is a charge for	driving	along the causeway to the jetty, and no reason for going to the end unless you plan to take the fast twin-hull, Maubua Express ferry to Lombok, a cruise to Nusa Lembongan, or a deep-sea fishing trip. Jimbaran Beach is a great arc of sand facing a sheltered bay south of the airport, shared by a handful of resort hotels and a fishing village. More hotels are rapidly going up on a new access road that runs parallel to the coast here. Look for the sign to Uluwatu on the road from the airport toward Nusa Dua — you have to pass it and then make a U-turn. Jimbaran Beach is famous for its restaurants that serve fresh grilled fish and seafood on the beach.	drive	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	2	43460	1	0.2651734164029756	roberta

It is probably correct that their primary reason for not doing so was to save money, not to piss off the victims of Colubmine. That does not change the fact that they did just that. Moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff. This is what good documentary filmmaking is about. And here the critics again ignore important evidence: When Heston mentions the mayor of Denver, the crowd boos loudly. Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayor's letter (only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request -- not mentioning at all the reasons you have given!). This booing by the crowd, not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article, shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by	coming	to Littleton after children were being killed there -- and they effectively said "Fuck you". To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moore's critics. 4) The Kayla Rolland case. Again, critics like yourself charge Moore with deception. The rally took place on October 17, the shooting on February 29. Again, standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion: "Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas. It is brilliantly, if unethically, done." As noted above, the "from my cold dead hands" part is simply Moore's way to introduce Heston. Did anyone but Moore's critics view it as anything else? He certainly does not "attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered" and, as noted above,	come	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving	masc_written	written	#essays#	essays_A_defense_of_Michael_Moore.txt	2	46760	1	0.2448002299787411	roberta

high bridge from the Ming period called “Longevity Bridge.” Here and elsewhere, the rich, flat land produces the ingredients for a formidable fruit salad: oranges and grapefruit, chestnuts and persimmons, plus exotic tropical delicacies all but unknown outside Asia. Adding to the entrancing beauty of the scene, great stands of a feathery variety of bamboo grow along the riverbanks, forming huge cascades of green. Beyond the village of Yangdi unfolds the uncanny scenery that prompted a Chinese poet more than a thousand years ago to write: “The river is a green silk belt, the mountains emerald hairpins.” Peaks and pinnacles crowd the river, white goats pose on steep mountainsides, and an eagle soars above the cliffs. The river itself flows green and transparent. Credit for this limpid rarity	goes	not only to the strict antipollution standards to protect the River Li but also to nature itself, which endows the water with a high content of carbonic acid. Mural Hill is so called because the sheer cliff face comprises so many patches of color that it might be a fresco. In the lights and shadows of the cliff, the shapes of nine different horses can be discerned, hence the cliff’s alternate name, “Nine Horse Hill.” Near the end of the voyage, the village of Xinping comes into view on the left bank, surrounded by magical scenery — landmarks with names like Snail Hill, Five Fingers Hill, and Carp Hill.	go	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	4	44352	1	0.09037333991842662	txl

The Forbidden City, so described because it was off-limits to ordinary people for nearly 500 years, is now called the Palace Museum. Designed to contain the auspicious number of 9,999 rooms, its scale is overwhelming and leaves many visitors bewildered. Built in the years 1406–1420, it was the residence of 24 emperors for nearly seven centuries. Tourists normally enter the Forbidden City from the south, after a long	walk	along a cobbled roadway from the Gate of Heavenly Peace. The main entrance to the compound, Meridian Gate (Wumen), was designed in the 15th century. Officials used the left portal, members of the imperial family the right. Next comes another ceremonial gate, the Gate of Supreme Harmony (Taihemen), first erected in 1420. A pair of monumental bronze lions stand guard. Beyond this powerful defense line stands China’s supreme ensemble of ancient architecture. First and foremost is the Hall of Great Harmony (Taihedian), popularly called the “Hall of the Imperial Throne.” This is the biggest building in the Forbidden City and one of China’s most beautiful wooden structures. For hundreds of years during the Ming and Qing dynasties this was the tallest building in all Beijing; by law no house could	walk	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	1	45186	1	0.061476554162310744	txl

Now create a large, square petri plate with rows and columns drawn on the plastic below to guide your experimental hands. Arrange the rows, numbered to to correspond to blue bacteria secreting to molecules a second. Arrange the columns, numbered to to correspond to the red bacteria secreting to molecules a second. Into each of the x cells on your square petri plate, place exactly one red and one blue bacterium with the corresponding secretion rates. Thus, in the upper left, bacteria that are low blue and low red secretors are coplated onto each square. On the lower left, high blue and low red secretors are coplated. On the upper right, low blue and high red secretors are coplated. And in the lower right corner, high red and high blue bacteria are coplated. Go for lunch, and dinner, and	come	back the next day. In general, among the , coplated pairs of bacteria, while all , colonies will have grown, a single pair will have grown to the largest mixed red-blue bacterial colony. Say the largest mixed red-blue colony corresponds to red secreting molecules per second, blue secreting molecules per second. This gedankenexperiment is important, for the exchange ratio of red and blue molecules is the analogue of price, the ratio of trading of oranges for apples. And there exists a ratio, red molecules to blue molecules per second, that maximizes the growth of the mixed red-blue bacterial colony. Since the fastest growing mixed red-blue colony will exponentially outgrow all others and dominate our gedankenexperiment petri plate, this red-blue pair establishes “price” in the system at red	come	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt	1	41621	1	0.053626519947174614	txl

Accommodatingly situated on the border between Ontario and Québec, Ottawa is a fully bilingual city, though most of the French-speaking community (and the best restaurants) now have their homes in Hull on the Québec side of the Ottawa River. Except for longer excursions, try to leave the car in the hotel parking lot and	walk	or take the bus. The complex system of one-way streets designed to avoid rather than to reach key government buildings, and the added confusion of curving rivers and canals, make downtown driving a harrowing business even for locals. One other point: In the absence of any clear logic in street numbering, it’s important when noting an address to be sure you have the nearest cross-streets as well as the number of the building.

The virgin forests were long a refuge for Algonquin Indians fleeing the Iroquois. The Québécois began to settle here in any great numbers only in the second half of the 19th century, when an enterprising curate, Antoine Labelle of St-Jérôme, promoted it as an alternative for peasants who were otherwise immigrating to New England. This southeastern edge of the great Canadian Shield proved poor farm country and difficult to exploit for logging, but it really came into its own in the 20th century with the development of tourism. In addition to local Montréalers, it attracts steady traffic from New England. The heart of the resort area is within an easy 90-minute to 2-hour	drive	from the city for a weekend or longer stay. Motorway 15 northwest from Montréal, then Highway 117 take you into forested foothills immediately beyond the metropolis. Just 70 km (42 miles) from the city, St-Sauveur-des-Monts makes a charming spot to stop for lunch on one of the roadside flowered terraces. In winter, the resort is popular for its floodlit nightskiing. Ste-Adèle on the shores of Lac Rond is a favorite with painters and their groupies. The town’s Village de Séraphin recaptures the atmosphere of life in the Laurentians in the 1880s.	drive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	1	43030	1	0.04917401083213496	txl

The charming, sleepy town of Serpa rises neatly above the plains, 30 km (18 miles) east of Beja, on the route to Spain. Beyond the formidable Porta da Beja, a monumental gate in the city wall, small streets wend among bright white houses. Many of the buildings hide small cheese factories, which produce Serpa’s famous ewe’s milk cheese. The town’s castle was partially destroyed by a Spanish attack in 1707, but still affords enjoyable views. The walls continue past a privately owned 17th-century mansion and on to a slender aqueduct, which ends in an ancient well with a working chain-pulley system for drawing water. A small ethnographic museum displays the wares of the agricultural and industrial workers of the area. From Serpa a rewarding	drive	takes you south toward the eastern Algarve, through a hilly and sparsely populated landscape where shepherds tend their flocks. Along the way is Mértola, an ancient white-washed town founded by the Phoenicians, built up by the Romans, and later seized by the Moors. Perched on a ridge at the junction of the River Guadiana and the smaller Oeiras, the town is protected by Moorish walls and topped by a rather dilapidated castle with a profusion of storks’ nests. Mértola bursts with history: Its church, the Igreja Matriz, betrays a previous incarnation as a mosque with a prayer niche (mihrab), while the town hall (now a museum) is constructed on Roman foundations. The Guadiana River continues as far as the Algarve, forming part of the border with Spain.

Where the road crosses over the Rideau River and Green Island, look for Rideau Falls, pouring its double “curtain” (French rideau) of water into the Ottawa River. The windmill is part of a Renewable Energy Exhibit of methods of gathering solar and wind energy. For Canadians, 24 Sussex Drive has the same significance as 10 Downing Street for the British. This grey stone house hidden behind the greenery is the Canadian Prime Minister’s residence. His neighborhood, in Rideau Hall just along the road (1 Sussex Drive), is the official residence of the monarchy, the governor general. Except on official occasions, the guards in appropriately British uniforms will usually let you drive or	walk	in to admire the sweeping stretch of lawns and gardens — look for the governor’s toboggan slide and skating rink. The drive then circles around the immaculate gardens and fine mansions of Rockcliffe Park. The park’s driveway takes you out to the Rockcliffe Lookout for a spectacular view of the Ottawa River and the mouth of the Gatineau. In the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Barracks, at the north end of St. Laurent Boulevard, you can see some of the horses performing or training for the popular RCMP Musical Ride, the one occasion when the Mounties are still Mounties.	walk	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	1	45160	1	0.043399333530963376	txl

Peace lasted for the rest of the century and the country made great economic strides as a province of the Habsburg empire. Factories, theatres, and newspapers were opened and Pest expanded its role in international trade while Buda regained its status as Hungary’s administrative centre. But prosperity was not for the majority. The rich were getting richer while the serfs were getting poorer, and the Magyar identity was being repressed by the influence of the Germanic Habsburgs. In the mid-19th century, the Hungarians once again	went	to war for their independence. The rebellion of 1848 was led by a group of young intellectuals, including the 25-year-old radical poet, Sándor Petoﬁ. A provisional government was formed, headed by Lajos Kossuth, but it was short-lived. The Emperor Franz Joseph I summoned help from the Czar of Russia and the revolt was crushed in 1849.	go	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-History.txt	3	45715	1	0.033034603498507016	txl

a now fires the same cannonball, which, however, hits a paddle on a sturdy paddle wheel I constructed. Once struck by the cannonball, the paddle wheel is set to spinning. Prior to my firing the cannonball, I contrived to tie one end of a red rope around the axle of the paddle wheel and a modest size bucket to the other end of the rope. Thereafter, I dropped the bucket down the well. The water-filled bucket has now rested, silent and waiting, until the cannonball strikes the paddle wheel, whereupon the wheel spins, the red rope winds up, pulling the water-filled bucket up the well, up against the axle, which tilts the bucket over  you will have to imagine this part  and pours the water into a long funnel that slopes down from the wellhead toward my bean field. When the water from the bucket	arrives	at the bottom of the water pipe, it pushes against a flap valve, thereby opening the valve and watering my bean field. You can see why I might be proud of my machine. What is the dierence between .a and .b? The point of the cannon and cannonball in the two figures is to emphasize that there is the same total input of energy into the two cases. The explosion of gunpowder is evidently the same, as is the flight of the cannonball. Obviously, in Figure .a, most of the energy carried by the cannonball is dissipated as heat, random molecular motions induced in the particles of dirt. Indeed, I might have sent the cannonball bouncing along a large steel plate rather than hitting mere dirt. In the case of the plate, no hole would have formed, and hot steel would have been the consequence.	arrive	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	4	40732	1	0.02935229358270728	txl

Immediately as you enter the compound you can get a bird’s-eye view of Grave Circle A, where the Royal grave shafts were found, and then climb to the top of the settlement to view the remains of the Royal Palace. From here the views of the surrounding rolling countryside are magnificent. Half a mile below the city is an immense Beehive tomb cut into the hillside and lined with stone blocks. The acoustics inside the tomb are very precise, exaggerating the sound of your approaching fellow visitors. If a party of schoolchildren	arrive	to test out the tomb, it may be a good idea to beat a hasty retreat for the sake of your ears! Further east from Mycenae is another ancient site also renowned for its acoustics. The Theater of Epidauros (Epidavros), was built in the fourth century b.c. and could hold an audience of 12,000 people. Live performances still take place here every summer. The theater does not sit in splendid isolation but was part of a large settlement based around the Sanctuary of Asklepios — one of the most important centers of healing in the ancient world. Today there is little left of the site and it is difficult to imagine hospitals, spas, and faith-healing practices catering to travelers from across the Greek world.	arrive	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt	1	40473	1	0.02832647213194941	txl

During colonial days the bay was visited by both Spanish galleons and pirate ships looking for shelter, repairs, or supplies. It was during this time that foreign navigators referred to the bay as Humpback Bay, or Bahía de las Jorobadas, because of the large number of humpback whales that appeared — and still appear — every winter. In the early 1800s gold and silver were found in the Sierra Madre Mountains, spurring an explosive growth of mining towns, including Talpa de Allende and San Sebastián. The mines needed salt to process the ore, and an enterprising man named Guadalupe Sánchez found the perfect location for this by the mouth of the Río Cuale. He and his family became the salt suppliers for the Cuale and San Sebastián silver mines. Others	arrived	to take part in this lucrative trade, and in 1851 the village, called Puerto Las Peñas, was established. The village grew steadily, and by 1895 construction began on the church in the town center, Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, named after the Virgin of Guadalupe, patron saint of the town. Sánchez originally founded the town on December 12th, the anniversary of the Virgin’s appearance.	arrive	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-History.txt	3	40725	1	0.027471480852360952	txl

Buda Hills The Buda Hills area is a greenbelt that lies due west of Rózsadomb, though it stretches as far north as Obuda and as far south as the start of the M7 highway. Choose a clear day, then catch any one of several trams or buses which	go	past the cog-railway terminus (just west of Moszkva tér, opposite the Hotel Budapest). There is room on the train for mountain bikes if you are feeling particularly active. The train passes smart residential houses on its way to the terminus and park of Sváb-hegy. A short walk across the park (just follow the crowds) is the stop for the Children’s Railway (Széchenyi-hegyi Gyermekvasút), thus named because it is operated almost entirely by school-children; only the engine drivers are adults. This is an old narrow-gauge line which traverses seemingly unspoiled forests — but for the numerous walking trails — and climbs, slowly, ever-upwards. At the ﬁrst stop, Normafa, you’ll find a ski-run, but unless it’s snowing stay on the train until János-hegy.

The dark glow began to flicker, and Isis’ frown of concentration became one of worry. The pools in her hands grew deeper. She didn’t shed a bead of sweat, and I didn’t even see her draw a breath, but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame. Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake. The blood in her palms, still filling up, began to ripple. Shivers swept through her body, and Nepthys reached out to touch her but I stopped him. He glanced at me with honest concern, probably the first honest moment he’d shown me: ‘Is she all right?’ I didn’t know. Her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out, splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs. She gasped and the dark glow	went	out, taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam. Isis collapsed on the fur, strings cut. Now Nepthys lunged forward, took her by the arms. “Isis, what happened?

f young Western-influenced artists emerged (also influenced by the Dutch pastel-ist, Rudolf Bonnet), putting Ubud on the world map of contemporary art. Spies’ house and spring-fed swimming pool (now part of the Tjampuhan Hotel) were visited by Western artists, academics, musicians, and stars of theater and film. Deeply involved in Balinese culture, Spies himself choreographed the still-performed version of the most famous Balinese dance, the kecak, based on a story from the “Ramayana.” When Germany invaded Holland in 1940, Spies was interned as an enemy alien. He died in 1942, when a ship on which he was being transported to British Ceylon was torpedoed by the Japanese. From 1900 until the start of World War II, many young Indonesians received a Dutch education, with the brightest students	going	to universities in the Netherlands. The Dutch language gave the vast polyglot archipelago a sense of unity, even among islands that had been bitter enemies for centuries. Indonesian nationalism and a movement for independence from Holland gained strength.

We're just in a period -- we've got to work to bring it -- my opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and I'm glad he did. John McCain is for me for president because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq. And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq. We've come, gentlemen, to our last question. And it occurred to me as I	came	to this debate tonight that the three of us share something. All three of us are surrounded by very strong women. We're all married to strong women. Each of us have two daughters that make us very proud.

– er, counterclockwise, then face east. East is that way.” He pointed at the wall to our right. “Don’t let the sun fool you. Then I’m going to shed a little blood, but don’t worry, none of yours.” I blinked at him, but he just kept walking until we reached the corner. “Okay, you might feel silly, but just turn three times to your left. Try to keep in time with me.” We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust. The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back. When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner. Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening the door. “Are you coming?” We slipped through the door and	came	out, not inside the building, but on a busy street in a completely different part of town. The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East. Nepthys took us immediately to the right, where he led us to a cart filled with herbs. Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn’t place. The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar. Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart, and with its long, many-shouldered pole of a torso, it rose over our heads even while seated. Its face was small and wrinkled,	come	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	masc_written	written	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	3	46429	1	0.020688294829321136	txl

e Menys (the name means “one fewer car” in Catalan) offers easygoing, enjoyable Barcelona-by-bike tours around La Ribera, the Gothic Quarter, and the waterfront (one includes dinner). Evening outings include drinks and even dinner (Tel. 93/268 21 05 or 93/207 08 96 for more information). On Tibidabo, the Carretera de las Aiguas, a dirt path that winds along the mountain for several miles, with spectacular views of the city below, is a great place to walk, jog, or bicycle. At the Reial Club de Golf El Prat near the airport, 27 holes provide three different circuits. Clubs and carts may be rented, and there’s a pool for spouses and children.

“Okay,” he said as we hit the street, “we’re going to see another friend of mine. First, though, we are getting you a hat. You look ridiculous with a shaved head.” At a nearby stand, he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston. It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front. Amy liked it, I think. She still hadn’t spoken since I named her, so I wasn’t sure. He took us to a squat, long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal. The black door opened as we	came	up to it, and a pale man opened the door. He was naked, but there was nothing to hide: his body was hairless and completely smooth. I only say “he” because he didn’t have a hint of femininity. His eyes were white. From behind him, I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure’s “A Forest”. “I’m here to see Isis. Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her.”	come	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	masc_written	written	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	3	46435	1	0.01893408824238055	txl

The capital of Bermuda since 1815, Hamilton is a very small and friendly city, despite its importance in the world of finance, banking, and insurance. It is the heart of government and decision making, and because it is the only container port on the island, it is also the center of shipping and trade. Local people gravitate here for shopping and entertainment, and visitors crowd the streets in summer when the cruise ships are in town. Front Street runs along the water and is the first part of town seen by cruise passengers as ships	come	to shore. It is the life and soul of Hamilton and a focus for many activities, especially during the summer months. A long row of pastel-painted buildings offer the best in tax-free shopping: jewelry, liquor, clothing, and crystal. Explore the narrow alleyways that lead off Front Street to discover small shops selling collectibles or locally designed arts and crafts, or small restaurants offering local seafood. On Front Street itself there are a number of restaurants with verandas on the first floor, where you can have a drink or meal and watch the world go by. At the west end of Front Street, on the waterfront, you will find the Visitor Service Bureau and the terminal for the local ferries that ply across Great and Little Sound from Hamilton to the southern and western parts of Bermuda.

ctive barrier against bad weather and attack from invaders. Its recent history is fascinating: In the 1930s it was owned by Swedish millionaire Axel Wenner-Gren, an arms manufacturer who was found to be a Nazi sympathizer. He sold the island to Huntingdon Hartford, who changed the name from Hog to Paradise and created a beautiful private retreat, now the Ocean Club Hotel. Later gangster Per Lansky began the process that transformed the island from a private sanctuary with magnificent homes into a playground for tourists. The wonderful beaches, such as Cabbage Beach on the northern coast, were the focus of the development. The first hotels began to appear in the 1960s when gambling was a lure to the rich and famous. As Paradise Island saw owners Donald Trump and Merv Griffin come and go, it	went	through a continuing series of developments and re-developments. Today Paradise Island may be close to fulfilling the dream of the perfect vacation playground. It has many of the essential ingredients needed: fine white-sand beaches, a protected marina, a golf course, a group of fine hotels, and perhaps the biggest adult playground this side of Las Vegas. The brainchild of the Sol Group, Atlantis Paradise Island is a new concept in resorts — it’s a huge hotel with an amazing theme park and entertainment village all on one site. The resort takes its name, and inspiration, from the lost city of Atlantis, said by some to lie off the coast of Bimini. This theme runs throughout the whole resort. The vast open foyers and public areas of the hotel have high columns of cathedral-like dimensions; th	go	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt	3	45696	1	0.016951312952233354	txl
