the role of make-believe play in children’s lives Among inﬂuential explanations of why preschoolers are so drawn to pretending, Freud’s psychoanalytic theory and Piaget’s cognitive theory held sway for much of the twentieth century.

 partly due to the way she approached them—by asking if they’d like to go. [SEP] By experimenting with language during play, children can see how others react to various styles of communication and use that information to reﬁne their way of speaking. [SEP] In this way, play is an ideal arena for mastering all aspects of conversational dialogue. [SEP] Opportunities to acquire literacy-relevant skills also abound in make-believe play. [SEP] In one kindergarten, children transformed the block-building area into a make-believe recycling center with the help of their teacher. [SEP] Signs were prepared that advertised the new center, its hours, and what it would pay for various goods. [SEP] As in other friendly businesses, attendants wore nametags, such as “Hi, I’m Charles!” [SEP] When customers	arrived	with goods, the attendants had to ﬁll out receipts listing each item, its quantity, and its value. [SEP] Since many children could not yet spell, they used ﬁrst letters or drew pictures of items. [SEP] While doing so, they often became curious about how to write the full word and asked the teacher to help them. [SEP] What does research say about the role of make-believe in children’s literacy development? [SEP] The amount of time children devote to pretending at age 4 is positively related to reading and writing skills after entering kindergarten and ﬁrst grade—speciﬁcally, the extent to which children spontaneously read words on game cards and signs, understand print concepts, and write letters and simple words.29 [SEP] The more children engage in literacy-relevant play (activities like th	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	3
adult involvement in children’s make-believe Piaget’s view of make-believe play, dominant until recently, asserts that pretending emerges spontaneously when children become capable of symbolic thought. [SEP] He assumed that very young children could not share play symbols with others. [SEP] Yet in instance after instance, we have seen that adults are central in preschoolers’ play lives, often encouraging and elaborating on their imaginative strivings. [SEP] If adults are prominent in early make-believe, how did researchers manage to adhere to an image of young children as solitary fantasizers for so long? [SEP] The reason is that until recently, make-believe was largely studied in the laboratory, in sessions in which children	arrived	one-at-a-time and had no alternative but to play by themselves. [SEP] Only during the past 10 years have researchers seriously addressed the social context of make-believe. [SEP] Their ﬁndings conﬁrm that pretending, like other higher forms of thinking, ﬂows from social collaboration. [SEP] More competent partners scaffold young children’s imaginative play, guiding its emergence and gradual reﬁnement. [SEP] Once pretend capacities are in place, children forge playful understandings with peers that serve as microcosms of cooperative activity, mirroring social relations and goal-oriented pursuits within the larger society.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	3
me of the largest businesses, held political offices, became artists or intellectuals, funded private and public education, and created a prosperous Mexican society envied by other communities of the Southwest, with elegant theaters like the Teatro Carmen and Spanish-language newspapers. [SEP] Tucson’s proximity to Mexico, especially Sonora, permitted Tucsonenses to remain close to their Mexican heritage. [SEP] According to Thomas Sheridan, “This Mexican elite represented a local florescence of Latin American civilization in Arizona, its society and culture linking Tucson with the finest traditions of both Mexico and Spain” (3). [SEP] Although there was a strong Mexican middle class, many Chicanos were working class, such as butchers, barbers, and later railroad workers. [SEP] The railroad	arrived	in southern Arizona on March 20, 1880, and this changed society in Tucson forever. [SEP] There has always been a substantial Chicano and Mexican population in Tucson. [SEP] The folklore of the region was recognized to be important, and Margarite Collier, an elementary school teacher, organized a Mexican Folklore Club at Carrillo School in Tucson in 1935. [SEP] An article in the Arizona Daily Star of December 19, 1943, states that the club was “to help the children sustain pride and interest in the traditions, customs and folklore of Mexico and to perpetuate these customs among Spanish-speaking people of Tucson.” [SEP] Miss Collier taught the children music, art, and folk dances of Mexico.

On the other hand, I am not persuaded that category theory will suce. [SEP] In category theory it seems necessary to specify ahead of time all the possible domains and ranges and mappings under consideration. [SEP] I will suggest in a later chapter when we consider the evolution of novelties that there is no finite prespecification for the work tasks, measurements, records, and catalytic tasks that might constitute autonomous agents. [SEP] In short, I will argue that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere. [SEP] Whether an incapacity to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere genuinely precludes the use of category theory to mathematize the concepts of autonomous agents and propagating organization is an open question. [SEP] We have	arrived	at this: An autonomous agent, or a collection of them in an environment, is a nonequilibrium system that propagates some new union of matter, energy, constraint construction, measurement, record, information, and work. [SEP] It is a new organization of process and events. [SEP] The collective behaviors of coevolving autonomous agents have, over the past four billion years, constructed a biosphere. [SEP] If life is common, the elaboration of biospheres in the universe is rife. [SEP] The propagating union of work cum record cum measurement cum constraint construction, the propagation of organization unfolding and diversifying, exhibits the very creativity of the universe. [SEP] We are entitled to ask whether there may be general laws governing such nonequilibrium self-constructive processes i	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	5
 that are absent from a description of human actions outside of the legal framework. [SEP] And descriptions of human actions = and, a fortiori, descriptions of the doings of autonomous agents, even bacteria acting on their own behalf to get dinner = seem to involve a diVerent language game than mere descriptions in terms of physical events. [SEP] Among other critical features of the action-and-doing language game is that, compared to a hypothetical “complete” physical description, the action-and-doing description picks out the relevant features with respect to the goals of the autonomous agent. [SEP] Interestingly, once we are at Dennett’s level of Popperian creatures, which can have internal models of, and plans for, the future and can have their models die in their stead, we seem to have	arrived	at a level of organization in which action-and-goal talk becomes essential. [SEP] Is there a finitely prestatable set of statements about physical events that is jointly necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement, “The cheetah is hunting the gazelle”? [SEP] Like other eVorts, we will find suYcient conditions but be hard pressed to find jointly necessary and suYcient conditions. [SEP] The dictionary hints at where our reductionism ideas may go wrong: Every word in the dictionary is defined in terms of other words. [SEP] How could it be otherwise?

[SEP] Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to "engage or "take out" the aircraft.

NORAD officials have maintained consistently that had the passengers not caused United 93 to crash, the military would have prevented it from reaching Washington, D.C. That conclusion is based on a version of events that we now know is incorrect. [SEP] The Langley fighters were not scrambled in response to United 93; NORAD did not have 47 minutes to intercept the flight; NORAD did not even know the plane was hijacked until after it had crashed. [SEP] It is appropriate, therefore, to reconsider whether United 93 would have been intercepted. [SEP] Had it not crashed in Pennsylvania at 10:03, we estimate that United 93 could not have reached Washington any earlier than 10:13, and probably would have	arrived	before 10:23. [SEP] There was only one set of fighters circling Washington during that time frame-the Langley F-16s. [SEP] They were armed and under NORAD's control. [SEP] After NEADS learned of the hijacking at 10:07, NORAD would have had from 6 to 16 minutes to locate the flight, receive authorization to shoot it down, and communicate the order to the pilots, who (in the same span) would have had to authenticate the order, intercept the flight, and execute the order. [SEP] At that point in time, the Langley pilots did not know the threat they were facing, did not know where United 93 was located, and did not have shootdown authorization.	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	5

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe’s southwestern extremity. [SEP] The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). [SEP] Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. [SEP] Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 [SEP] b.c. [SEP] , followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. [SEP] But it was the Romans, who	arrived	late in the third century [SEP] b.c. [SEP] , who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. [SEP] They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. [SEP] The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century [SEP] a.d. [SEP] had introduced Christianity. [SEP] By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro.

lo, now three hours by road from Athens to the northwest. [SEP] In ancient times this was the spiritual center of the Greek world and people would travel by land or sea to consult the gods. [SEP] No important decisions of state could be made without consulting the Oracle here, and when the Colossus of Rhodes was toppled in an earthquake the people of that city-state in the Aegean left it where it lay after advice from the Oracle not to rebuild it. [SEP] There has been a temple here since pre-historic times when Gaia the Earth-Mother goddess was worshipped. [SEP] Even in these early times the gods would be consulted with the oracle issuing their verdicts from the Rock of Sybil. [SEP] Later, Olympian gods usurped Gaia but the sanctuary retained its role. [SEP] Legend says that the God Apollo	arrived	at Delphi by sea on a dolphin and slayed the monstrous python that guarded the entrance to the sanctuary. [SEP] Thus the temple was named in his honor. [SEP] A modern road cuts through the remains and the approach to the site from the parking lot leads first to the Roman Agora, where pilgrims would stock up on supplies and offerings for the temple only a few minutes away. [SEP] Here you can see the remains of the Sanctuary of Apollo, the nearby waters of the Kastalian Springs where pilgrims would purify themselves before their consultation, and the Rock of Sybil where the oracle proclaimed the verdict of the gods.

The American Revolutionary War When the 13 American colonies, enraged by the Stamp Tax, got into the war that eventually brought independence, the Bahamas somewhat reluctantly found itself on England’s side. [SEP] But reluctance dissolved as profits from privateering once again flowed into Nassau. [SEP] This time the plundered vessels were American, but not all the victories were won by the privateers. [SEP] On 3 March 1776, a rebel squadron under Commodore Esek Hopkins	arrived	and occupied Nassau for two weeks, a bloodless undertaking that emptied the island’s forts of arms and other military supplies. [SEP] A smaller and equally non-violent American operation against the town in January 1778 lasted less than three days. [SEP] As the colonies’ war effort picked up steam, both France and Spain weighed in against the British.

The longest unbroken island in the Bahamas, slender Eleuthera (pronounced “e-LOOTH-ra”) extends 100 miles (160 km) from north to south yet has many stretches that are barely half a mile (1 km) wide. [SEP] Some of the wildest Bahamian landscapes are to be found on this island that seems to be more in touch with the moods of the sea than other islands are. [SEP] The rocky outcrops and sometimes towering waves on the east contrast with calm waters and sandy flats on the west. [SEP] In the northwest a series of cays and sand banks reach out to fill the 60 miles (96 km) or so between Eleuthera and New Providence. [SEP] Modern Bahamian history began on this island in 1648 when the Eleutherian Adventurers, led by William Sayle,	arrived	from Britain and Bermuda and founded their shaky colony. [SEP] They landed near the site of Governor’s Harbour on the middle of the island, but after a period of feuding Sayle and some of his followers moved north to Harbour Island and Spanish Wells. [SEP] Their descendants still live there today. [SEP] Although they named the island Eleuthera, you may find that the local people call the island Cigatoo, its old Lucayan name. [SEP] Harbour Island, called “Briland” by the locals, sits off the northeastern corner of the main island. [SEP] You can reach it via a 15-minute ride on a small ferry; taxis from North Eleuthera Airport run reliable service to the docks for a set price per person.

The North Coast Before the days of flying, most visitors to Bali	arrived	in the north.

[SEP] Now, almost everyone arrives and stays in southern Bali, and only a fraction of them ever take a trip to the north coast, although the journey takes less than two hours by road. [SEP] There is quite a contrast between the south and north. [SEP] It is hotter and drier in the north and far less densely populated. [SEP] The proportion of Muslims is higher; some of the people are descended from traders and immigrants from other islands. [SEP] There is only a narrow strip of flat land between the mountains and the sea, or in some places none at all.

[SEP] North up Zhengyi Lu (the former Canal Street) back toward Chang’an Avenue are the former Japanese Legation (now the Beijing Mayor’s office) and the British Legation, once the largest Western stronghold in Beijing (occupied from 1860 to 1959), now the stronghold of the Chinese security services. [SEP] Southwest of Tiananmen Square, in the city’s Xuanwu District, is the Ox Street Mosque (Niu Jie Qingzhen Si), the center of Beijing’s most vibrant Muslem quarter. [SEP] Here the capital’s 200,000 people of the Hui minority — largely indistinguishable from Beijing’s Han Chinese majority — practice many of the ways of Islam, which	arrived	in China from the far western regions of the Silk Road during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). [SEP] This mosque, originally constructed in the year 996, is Chinese in style but contains a six-sided astronomical tower, a bathhouse, an Islamic prayer hall facing Mecca, a minaret for calling the faithful to prayer, and tombs of Moslem leaders dating to the time of Kublai Khan. [SEP] Southwest Beijing is also the location of the city’s main Catholic church, South Cathedral (Nan Tang), also known as Mary’s Church. [SEP] It was constructed on the site of missionary Matteo Ricci’s residence in 1650 and rebuilt for the last time in 1904 after being destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion.

Prussia — and Napoleon With his ambition of uniting the states of Brandenburg and Prussia, it was the Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm (1640–1688) who prepared Berlin to become a strong capital, and fortified it as a garrison town. [SEP] The first newcomers were 50 wealthy Jewish families who had been expelled from Vienna in 1671. [SEP] Then 14 years later 5,600 Huguenot Protestants	arrived	after being driven out of France by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. [SEP] At a time when France was considered the cultural master of Europe, these sophisticated merchants and highly skilled craftsmen — among them jewelers, tailors, chefs, and restaurant-owners — brought a new refinement to the town. [SEP] This was further enhanced by the Great Elector’s son, who in 1701 crowned himself in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) King Friedrich in (not of) Prussia. [SEP] Prompted by Sophie Charlotte, his wife, the king founded academies for the arts and sciences in Berlin. [SEP] Baroque master Andreas Schlüter (see page 48) was commissioned to redesign the royal palace, which was knocked down in 1951 to make way for East Germany’s Palast der Republik.

[SEP] Berlin boomed as the center of Germany’s machine industry and was a perfect market for mass-circulation newspapers and big department stores such as KaDeWe (Kaufhaus des Westens), founded in 1907. [SEP] After that philistine period of rapid growth, the city at last began to assume its place as Germany’s cultural as well as political capital, with Berlin artists Max Liebermann, Lovis Corinth, and Max Slevogt challenging Munich’s dominance of German painting. [SEP] The Berlin Philharmonic asserted an international prestige, attracting Tchaikovsky, Strauss, and Grieg as guest composers, and in 1905, the great Viennese director Max Reinhardt	arrived	to head the Deutsches Theater. [SEP] Among its scientists, Robert Koch won a Nobel prize for his discovery of the Tuberculosis bacillus, and Max Planck headed the new Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science (later named the Max-Planck-Institut), with Albert Einstein as director of the physics department.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] They made their way to Wilmington, North Carolina, the closest Confederate port to Bermuda. [SEP] Here they would take on a new cargo of cotton — a most profitable ballast that increased in value tenfold by the time it was delivered to buyers in Britain. [SEP] St. George’s boomed during the Civil War; the town seethed with sailors, speculators, Confederate agents, and Union spies. [SEP] When General Lee laid down his sword in 1865, it was as if Bermuda, too, had lost a war. [SEP] In the years that followed, Bermuda’s fortunes picked up as the first steamships began to arrive on a regular basis. [SEP] In 1883 Princess Louise (daughter of Queen Victoria)	arrived	on a lengthy visit en route to her new home farther north, as the wife of the Governor General of Canada. [SEP] She extolled Bermuda to those in her upper-class English circles, and wealthy tourists began to arrive soon thereafter. [SEP] By the turn of the century, Bermuda was a well-known winter destination for visitors from the US and Canada as well as Britain.

Start at King’s Square on the waterfront. [SEP] Originally known as “Market Square,” it was the center of all activity for the town. [SEP] Here you will find the Tourist Information office, whose helpful staff will be able to supply you with information about the day’s activities. [SEP] On the east side of the square is the Town Hall, which dates from 1782. [SEP] Although relatively young by St. George’s standards, it has wonderful cedar wood floors and ceilings. [SEP] Here you can find out about the previous lord mayors and view a commemorative “Charles and Diana” signature, harkening back to happy times. [SEP] At the northwest corner of the square is the Bermuda Museum of the National Trust. [SEP] This 17th-century building was constructed by Governor Samuel Day, who	arrived	from England, found the old governor’s house in disrepair, and built this house using government land and government wood — yet he refused to hand over the house when he was ousted from office after only two years. [SEP] The house became a hotel, the Globe, in the mid-19th century but attracted notoriety again in the early 1860s when it became the office of a Confederate agent during the US Civil War. [SEP] In 1952, the house was acquired by the Bermuda Historical Monuments Trust and was opened as a museum in 1961, with substantial refurbishment in 1996. [SEP] On the ground floor, pride of place is given to a detailed model of Somers’s ship, Sea Venture.

[SEP] The “peppercorn” rent is handed over to the crown in one of the most ornate ceremonial occasions of the year, with the mayor and town officials in full official regalia. [SEP] Water Street leads away from King’s Square to the west. [SEP] It has many shops selling tax-free goods; the modern shops occupy space in much older buildings. [SEP] Wander along the traffic-free thoroughfare to do some leisurely souvenir hunting. [SEP] On your right, watch for Tucker House Museum, which was from 1775 the home of Henry Tucker, the President of the Governor’s Council. [SEP] The Tuckers were one of the most influential families on Bermuda, the first family member having	arrived	on the island in 1616. [SEP] In 1950, a descendant — an American named Robert Tucker — bequeathed many family heirlooms to the house in his will. [SEP] The kitchen area, originally separated from the main house, was once a barbershop operated by Henry Raine, a black man who came to Bermuda to escape the worst of the American Civil War. [SEP] Once the war was over, he and his family returned to the US, where he became the first black member elected to the House of Representatives. [SEP] Across the street is the Carriage Museum. [SEP] Until the 1940s, horses and carriages were the only modes of transportation permitted along the narrow Bermuda roads, and almost every well-to-do family had a horse-drawn vehicle.

[SEP] But they were actually Magyars (the Hungarian word for Hungarians); their language was strange to outsiders. [SEP] The tribe’s name for itself became the name of the country and its language, as well. [SEP] Related tribes, who had earlier travelled northwest while the Magyars migrated west, ended up in Finland.

[SEP] In the succeeding centuries, their descendants continued to push south and east, and eventually spread out to people the whole of the continent from Alaska to Patagonia. [SEP] The tribes who decided to settle in what is now California were fortunate in their choice of homeland.

The early years of statehood were marked by a rough-and-ready kind of justice.

[SEP] The worst-treated, however, were the Native Americans, whose numbers dwindled rapidly not only as a result of disease and malnutrition but also because of systematic massacres in the 1850s by Californian militia. [SEP] In 1859 the discovery of silver (the Comstock Lode in western Nevada) caused a Silver Rush in the reverse direction, with the mining being organized almost completely from California.

The city of Lompoc (Route 135 and Route 1 from Santa Maria) sits prettily among the fields of flowers that have made it the “Flower-Growing Capital of the World.” [SEP] On the edge of town is La Purísima Mission, founded in 1787 and rebuilt in 1813 after an earthquake. [SEP] It is the most extensively and authentically restored of California’s 21 Franciscan missions, and the old pink-and-white adobe walls provide a haven of peace amid the former living and working quarters of missionaries, soldiers, and Native Americans. [SEP] The garden is full of olive and mulberry trees, and livestock such as burros, turkeys, and four-horned churro sheep all contribute to the 1820s atmosphere. [SEP] When you get to Santa Barbara you know for sure that you’ve	arrived	in Southern California.

The Kwakiutl For the relative opulence of their way of life, the Kwakiutl of British Columbia’s Pacific coast on and around Vancouver Island count among the aristocrats of Canadian native peoples. [SEP] For centuries, they have harvested an abundance of fish from the ocean and rivers — not just salmon but halibut, herring, mussels, and clams. [SEP] From the forests they have hewed red cedar planks for handsomely crafted houses and 22-m (65-ft) canoes to negotiate the coastal waters. [SEP] Before European textiles	arrived	on the scene, the Kwakiutl pounded cedar bark until it was supple and soft enough to weave into capes, skirts, and blankets. [SEP] The mild climate and generally easy living have given them the leisure to develop artistic talents less apparent among native peoples and Inuit facing harsher conditions. [SEP] Elaborate decoration has gone into fashioning the simplest everyday objects — clothing, baskets, storage boxes, even fishhooks. [SEP] Carpentry is the most valued of Kwakiutl skills, and is spectacularly displayed in their totem poles. [SEP] But this is not an ancient art form.

[SEP] Over time, a society developed that was so successful they could devote time to activities other than simple food cultivation. [SEP] These people, known as the Olmec, are considered to be the first Mesoamerican culture, the one from which all others evolved.

[SEP] The Maya went out on raiding parties, taking hostages from the surrounding lands to use in their bloody ceremonies. [SEP] The murals and reliefs at Mayan cities tell gory tales of beheading and the tearing out of human hearts to appease the lords of the underworld. [SEP] Archaeologists dredging the Sacred Cenote of Chichén Itzá have recovered dozens of human skeletons, thought to be the remains of victims sacrificed to the rain god. [SEP] Mayan civilization in the northern Yucatán reached its peak around a.d. 900–1200. [SEP] For reasons still unknown — perhaps civil war, drought, or disease — the great cities were abandoned. [SEP] By the time the Spaniards	arrived	in the early 16th century the jungle was reclaiming the pyramids; the richly painted murals of warriors, Mayan lords, animals, and gods were already crumbling and dissolving in the warm rain.

Isla Mujeres (Island of the Women) lies only 8 km (5 miles) offshore from Cancún; the 40-minute ferry ride transports you from an ultra-modern atmosphere to an environment in which time moves more slowly. [SEP] Several companies offer one-day sailing trips to Isla Mujeres, often including lunch and snorkeling; they depart from Playa Linda and Pier Tortugas in the Hotel Zone. [SEP] Isla Mujeres now has a population of around 15,000. [SEP] In past centuries, however, it was the haunt of Caribbean pirates, being far from the clutches of colonial overlords in Havana, San Juan in Puerto Rico, and Panama City, the nearest colonial outposts. [SEP] The earliest recorded visitors	arrived	in 1517, when Spanish explorer Francisco Hernández de Córdoba landed to discover a number of small temples built for the goddess of fertility Ix chel. [SEP] It was he who named the island. [SEP] Mujeres is only 8 km (5 miles) in length, less than a kilometer (1⁄2 mile) at its widest point, and split by inland lakes and bays. [SEP] One main road forms an ellipse, following the shape of the coastline. [SEP] Most ferries deposit you at the very northern tip of the island, on the main pier of the only town on Mujeres. [SEP] Craft shops and bars crowd onto the sidewalks and sandy streets. [SEP] The place bustles, especially when the ferries arrive. [SEP] As afternoon turns to evening and the day-trippers head back to Cancún, Isla Mujeres takes on a much quieter character.

onferred rather late in the city’s history. [SEP] During its early grandeur under the State of Chu, the town was called “Jinling,” a name still used in literary and other allusions. [SEP] Then in the third century, in the era of the Three Kingdoms, it was christened “Jianye.” [SEP] Under that or similar titles it served as the capital of six southern dynasties. [SEP] The Ming emperors made it the national capital, but this was soon moved north to Beijing in the 15th century. [SEP] In the 20th century a series of dramas overtook Nanjing and gave it new prominence. [SEP] It was here that Dr. Sun Yat-sen was elected president of the republic. [SEP] Chiang Kai-shek made it his capital until the advance of Japanese invasion forces induced him to head west. [SEP] When the Japanese troops finally	arrived	here in 1937, the “Rape of Nanking” was added to the catalogue of war’s atrocities. [SEP] A monument (Datusha Jinianguan) just outside the old city wall commemorates the victims; around 100,000 died in the first four days alone. [SEP] The Nationalists regained the battered city after the Japanese surrender in 1945. [SEP] The Communist army crossed the Yangzi (which the Chinese people call Changjiang, or “Long River”) in April 1949, bringing the new order to the old capital. [SEP] The Yangzi River Bridge (Nanjing Changjiang Daqiao) is an extraordinary engineering achievement. [SEP] Only a few bridges span the entire river, and this is the longest: at 1,577 m over water, it is a little less than a mile.

The French Quarter West of the riverside and old Chinese section is a landmark of modern history: the low brick building at 76 Xingyelu, where the Chinese Communist Party was founded in July 1921. [SEP] This was in the French concession, and when the French police learned of the clandestine meeting, they raided the two-story corner house. [SEP] But they	arrived	too late to find the 12 conspirators, including Mao Zedong. [SEP] The Communist founding fathers continued their congress aboard a hired excursion boat on a lake. [SEP] The house is today a museum with documents and displays. [SEP] Today, much of the finest European architecture in Shanghai is most visible in and around the French Quarter. [SEP] Art-Deco and Tudor villas, neo-Gothic offices, and large elegant mansions line many of the small streets. [SEP] The modern Garden Hotel (58 Maominglu) preserves the original lobby area of the Cercle Sportif Français from the 1920s. [SEP] The Shanghai Arts and Crafts Research Institute is housed in a wonderful old French mansion (79 Fenyanglu) and allows visitors to view artisans at work on embroidery, paper cutting, and other crafts.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] Shaolin now provides movie sets for film crews as well as schools for domestic and foreign classes in self-defense. [SEP] As an excursion, it is close to Zhengzhou (80 km/50 miles to the east) and Luoyang (70 km/43 miles west). [SEP] You don’t have to be a kung fu practitioner to enjoy Shaolin. [SEP] While crowded and commercialized, Shaolin is still one of China’s most interesting historical and religious monuments, dating back to the end of the fifth century a.d. In 625 it was expanded by a Tang Dynasty emperor in gratitude for wartime services rendered by the Shaolin monks, who used their fighting skills to send off some usurpers. [SEP] In the early sixth century, a monk from India named Da Mo	arrived	at Shaolin, where he founded Chan Buddhism. [SEP] Da Mo, who was probably a legendary rather than actual figure, is also heralded as the founder of kung fu (wushu), a system of hand-to-hand combat that was later modified to produce the immensely popular form of exercise that millions practice every morning throughout China — taiqi (tai chi), sometimes called “shadow boxing” in the West. [SEP] The Shaolin monks do seem to have been well-versed in self-defense over the centuries. [SEP] In the 16th century they were called upon to rid China’s coast of Japanese pirates. [SEP] In 1928, when warlords carved up sections of the faltering Chinese Republic, one general laid siege to the monastery and set it ablaze.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	3
Nanchang, Jiangxi Province. [SEP] Founded in the Han Dynasty, Nanchang is the provincial capital and main industrial center of the subtropical Jiangxi Province. [SEP] In 1927 it was the setting for the first Communist-led armed uprising against the Nationalist forces. [SEP] A number of relics of Zhou Enlai and other leaders of the Nanchang Uprising have been preserved in the city’s museum, which is devoted to the insurrection. [SEP] Ningbo (Ningpo), Zhejiang Province. [SEP] Situated down the coast from Shanghai, this port town has a long history of overseas connections. [SEP] First it was involved in trade with Japan. [SEP] Then the Portuguese	arrived	and settled here. [SEP] Finally, a British consulate was established in the town after the end of the Opium Wars. [SEP] The sights include a thousand-year-old wooden temple and a Ming Dynasty library in a pretty garden. [SEP] Qufu (Chufu), Shandong Province. [SEP] The birthplace of Confucius has been turned into an architectural ensemble on the scale of the Forbidden City in Beijing. [SEP] The memorial temple was begun in 478 b.c., the year after the philosopher’s death, and improvements and expansions went on for another 2,000 years. [SEP] The compound itself contains ceremonial gateways, palaces, pavilions, and shrines. [SEP] The tombs of Confucius and most of his descendants are set among ancient pines and cypress to the north of the town.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	3
The Phoenicians ventured across the Mediterranean from present-day Lebanon, reaching Spain by about 1100 b.c. They founded many trading settlements in the “remote” or “hidden land” they named Span or Spania. [SEP] The Costa Blanca was soon dotted with such Phoenician towns as Elche and Játiva. [SEP] After about 650 b.c., Greek traders	arrived	on the coast to compete for Spain’s rich mineral deposits and fertile land. [SEP] The influence of Greece was short-lived, although the olive and the grape, Greek legacies, are cultivated in the region. [SEP] The Carthaginians, a people related to the Phoenicians, came from North Africa and subsequently took over much of southern Spain, beginning with Cádiz in 501 b.c. The town had sought help from the Carthaginian army in its war against local tribes, and the “invited guest” decided to stay.

Moorish Domination In a.d. 711, the Arab chief Tariq landed at Gibraltar with 12,000 Berber troops. [SEP] Thus began an 800-year epoch of Christian opposition to the newly	arrived	Muslims. [SEP] The Moors—the name commonly given to all Muslims in Spain—carried all before them. [SEP] Within ten years their green-crescent standard flew over most of Spain. [SEP] Kartajanah, Mursiyah, and Xativa are still known by their Moorish names. [SEP] The Moors were relatively tolerant rulers who taxed non-believers rather than trying to convert them. [SEP] They introduced the manufacture of paper, which is carried on today in Játiva. [SEP] They laid out a system of irrigation still in use in the Guadalest Valley and filled the huertas (orchards) of the Costa Blanca with oranges, peaches, and pomegranates.

The Golden Age Spain’s golden century began under the “Catholic Monarchs,” a title conferred by Pope Alexander VI on Ferdinand II and Isabella, who united the country under the Christian kingdoms of Aragon and Castile after the fall of Granada in 1492. [SEP] That same eventful year, Columbus, seeking a western route to the East on behalf of the Catholic Monarchs,	arrived	in the Americas. [SEP] And Ferdinand and Isabella consolidated Christian rule by decreeing that all Jews—the banking and business experts—must adopt Catholicism or be exiled. [SEP] The Moors —the source of cheap labour and vital agricultural know-how—were given the same alternative in 1502. [SEP] The Segura Valley was the last part of Spain to be inhabited by Muslims, who abandoned their fortresses there in 1505. [SEP] As the Inquisition established its reign of terror to stamp out heresy, converted Jews, conversos, and Muslims, moriscos, were looked upon with suspicion, and many left the country or were condemned to death.

The southern part of Spain is at a geographical crossroads: It is the gateway between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, and the crossing point between Africa and Europe. [SEP] The strategic importance of its location has given rise to a long and turbulent history. [SEP] The earliest evidence of human occupation is provided by the Paleolithic cave paintings, some 25,000 years old, in the Cueva de la Pileta. [SEP] Neolithic peoples	arrived	on the scene in the fourth millennium b.c., leaving behind signs of early attempts at agriculture and fragments of their pottery. [SEP] Tribes of Iberians from North Africa crossed over into Spain around 3000 b.c., and initiated Spain’s first experiments in architecture; Spain’s oldest structure stands near Antequera, a dolmen burial chamber known as the Cueva de Romeral. [SEP] After 900 b.c., wandering bands of Celts entered the peninsula from northern Europe, and brought to the area their knowledge of bronze and iron work.

[SEP] It was already a thriving riverside settlement when Julius Caesar	arrived	in 45 b.c., and under the Romans, it developed into a major town. [SEP] In fact, two Roman emperors, Hadrian and Trajan, were born in nearby Itálica. [SEP] Subsequently, Sevilla became the capital of the Visigothic kingdom and then of a Moorish taifa, before falling to King Ferdinand III in 1248. [SEP] A monopoly of trade with the New World brought the city to its peak during the Golden Age. [SEP] “Madrid is the capital of Spain,” the saying went, “but Sevilla is the capital of the world.” [SEP] The two most prominent monuments in the city are located around the Plaza del Triunfo.

[SEP] But Christianity eventually triumphed to achieve the strong Orthodoxy of today, and Titus became Crete’s patron saint. [SEP] When Roman power split in two, the eastern Byzantine Empire inherited the island (though its hold on islands in the south of its dominion were, in reality, nominal). [SEP] Attacks by pirates and Islamic forces brought terror to the people, but Cretans remained loyal to the Orthodox Church throughout the Arab occupation of a.d. 824–961.

[SEP] This did not satisfy the people and the prince was forced to resign only a few years later under threat of revolt and the demand for union with Greece. [SEP] It was only in 1913, under the leadership of Elefthérios Venizélos, a native Cretan, that the longed-for énosis (union) was achieved. [SEP] Though unscathed by World War I, Crete saw major changes in the mid 1920s. [SEP] The Atatürk revolution, which announced a new Turkish Republic, brought massive upheaval through the area with a forced population exchange between Greece and Turkey beginning in 1923. [SEP] Thousands of Turks were evacuated, and thousands of Greek refugees from Asia Minor	arrived	to take their place. [SEP] However, agricultural resources and output were improved and the new arrivals soon began to settle.

[SEP] He signed up some 10,000 Germans, mostly Rhinelanders, to share the “golden future” in Louisiana. [SEP] Today, west of New Orleans along what is called the German Coast, you can see towns with names like Hahnville, Kraemer, and Des Allemands.

[SEP] In 1554, after the sixth sacking, the settlers decided to move inland to the town’s present hilltop location. [SEP] With remarkable persistence the pirates climbed all the way, twice, just to pillage San Germán. [SEP] More ominous than the French were the forces of Sir Francis Drake. [SEP] The great British navigator and adventurer operated in the Caribbean for years before he turned his attention to Puerto Rico.

[SEP] In 1872, one momentous decree abolished the 350-year-old institution of slavery in Puerto Rico, and in 1897 Spain cut the colonial ties and finally granted the island autonomy.

[SEP] A marked Aztec influence is also present, probably due to the centuries-long migration of Aztecs from the legendary city of Aztlán, on the Pacific coast, to Tenochtitlan, present-day Mexico City. [SEP] Remains of these cultures can be seen in the Museo del Río Cuale. [SEP] The first Spaniard to encounter these Nahuatl settlements was Hernán Cortez’s nephew, Francisco Cortez de Buenaventura. [SEP] He	arrived	at the Jalisco-Nayarit coast in 1524, shortly after the fall of Tenochtitlan. [SEP] He was met by “…a formidable army of 20,000 warriors, their bows decorated by myriad colored banners…” This impressive assembly earned the fertile Río Ameca Valley (just north of present day Puerto Vallarta) the name Valle de Banderas (Valley of the Banners), and the great bay just in front of the valley became known as Bahía de Banderas. [SEP] During colonial days the bay was visited by both Spanish galleons and pirate ships looking for shelter, repairs, or supplies. [SEP] It was during this time that foreign navigators referred to the bay as Humpback Bay, or Bahía de las Jorobadas, because of the large number of humpback whales that appeared — and still appear — every winter.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-History.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] In the early 1800s gold and silver were found in the Sierra Madre Mountains, spurring an explosive growth of mining towns, including Talpa de Allende and San Sebastián. [SEP] The mines needed salt to process the ore, and an enterprising man named Guadalupe Sánchez found the perfect location for this by the mouth of the Río Cuale. [SEP] He and his family became the salt suppliers for the Cuale and San Sebastián silver mines. [SEP] Others	arrived	to take part in this lucrative trade, and in 1851 the village, called Puerto Las Peñas, was established. [SEP] The village grew steadily, and by 1895 construction began on the church in the town center, Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, named after the Virgin of Guadalupe, patron saint of the town. [SEP] Sánchez originally founded the town on December 12th, the anniversary of the Virgin’s appearance.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-History.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	3
Even though Puerto Escondido is the more mature tourist destination of the two, Huatulco has the deepest historical roots. [SEP] The Aztecs and Chichimecs (a Nahuatl-speaking warrior community) knew Huatulco as an important trading port long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors. [SEP] The name Huatulco is of Aztec origin and means “land where a tree is worshipped,” reflecting the intriguing legend of the “Santa Cruz de Huatulco” (“Sacred Cross of Huatulco”). [SEP] When the Spaniards	arrived	at Huatulco in the late 1530s, the local Indians showed them a massive cross by the edge of the shore that they worshipped. [SEP] A legend arose that the cross may have been left by an ancient saint — perhaps even the Apostle Thomas — some fifteen centuries earlier. [SEP] The cross remained during the Spanish conquest and even survived an attempt to destroy it by the pirate Cavendish. [SEP] In 1612 Bishop Juan de Cervantes took part of the cross to the capital city of Oaxaca and used it as the foundation of a replica, which today stands in the main altar of the cathedral. [SEP] Another piece was set in silver and sent to the Vatican. [SEP] For centuries the bays of Huatulco basked quietly under the sun. [SEP] Then, in the mid-1970s, FONATUR turned its eyes towards the southern coast of Oaxa	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-History.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	3
