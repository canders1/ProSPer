 from a carousel at one end and delivers finished sleeves at the other. [SEP] One operator can tend to the needs of two such machines. [SEP] Yet because the investment per worker is several hundred thousand dollars, it only makes sense if the equipment is used nearly continuously. [SEP] Sewing factories, in contrast, are not capital intensive and are rarely operated for more than one shift. [SEP] Because of this, most expensive automation equipment is concentrated in preassembly, drawing on multi-shift operations. [SEP] Marker-making, fusing processes, sleeve-making for T-shirts, die-cutting, and computer-driven knife-cutting fall into this automated “getting ready to sew” category. [SEP] As always in a world of lean retailing and rapid replenishment, the need for faster production is what	drives	these capital-intensive technical innovations. [SEP] Because some U.S. manufacturers have found that centralizing preassembly operations also improves the quality of products, this may provide another edge for American apparel-makers in the future. [SEP] Our survey indicates that the average length of time it takes to get a garment ready for sewing, from issuing the order for a given marker to having the pieces cut and otherwise prepared, is 4.9 working days. [SEP] The cut parts are then sent to sewing areas or other factories. [SEP] If the sewing room is in the same building as the cutting room, then cut goods are sent over many times a day. [SEP] If the sewing factory is far away, then a shipment once a week is typical.

Low Rider The expression “low rider” is used to describe the car, the subculture, and the person who	drives	a vehicle that has been lowered, rides very low, and has been customized. [SEP] A car, truck, bicycle, van, or motorcycle that has been lowered—and this can be achieved by various methods—means that it sits very close to the ground and has a sleek streamlined appearance. [SEP] The driver and/or owner is called a low rider and the act of low riding refers to all the activities associated with driving the car: cruising, caravanning, and hopping. [SEP] Low riders have commonly been associated with cholos (1990s urban youth) and gangs, but traditionally Chicanos seriously involved in low riding and customizing low-rider cars are not involved in gangs, and low-rider clubs actually present an alternative to gang involvement.

ed that the biosphere and universe as a whole is vastly nonergodic, hence, kinetically trapped in a small region of its total space of possibilities, it is fair to wonder whether general laws may govern this nonergodic flow. [SEP] Given that the dimensionality of the adjacent possible of the biosphere has expanded in the past . [SEP] billion years, I want to make the obvious conjecture at a law: Our biosphere and any biosphere expands the dimensionality of its adjacent possible, on average, as rapidly as it can. [SEP] I will return just below to think about bounds on this expansion. [SEP] For, as we will see, it seems reasonable that if the expansion were too rapid, the system would destroy the propagating organization of autonomous agents whose coevolution and increasing diversity is what	drives	expansion into the adjacent possible and tends secularly to increase that dimensionality. [SEP] Autonomous agents persistently stumble onto new ways of making a living with one another and exploit those new ways. [SEP] The biosphere’s advance into the adjacent possible is just exaptation over and over again. [SEP] In fact, it seems reasonable to think of the “workspace” of the biosphere, that is, what can happen next, as its actual plus its real adjacent possible. [SEP] It seems likely, and I do conjecture, that the biosphere is expanding its workspace, on average, as fast as it can do so without destroying itself in the process.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	4
 gene A is , then gene B is sure to be the next moment, regardless of the activities of B and C. So A is a canalyzing input to B. But if B is , that too assures that B will be at the next moment. [SEP] So B is a canalyzing input to itself. [SEP] And similarly, if gene C is , gene B is sure to be the next moment. [SEP] Gene B has three canalyzing inputs. [SEP] By contrast, gene A in Figure .c has no canalyzing input, so is not a canalyzing Boolean function. [SEP] No value of A alone, B alone, or C alone suces to guarantee the next activity of gene A. In general, Boolean functions of K inputs may have ,,,   .    [SEP] .   .     K canalyzing inputs. Numerical evidence shows that, for K > inputs per gene, a sucient bias toward a high fraction of genes with a sucient number of canalyzing inputs	drives	networks from the chaotic into the ordered regime. Figure .b shows the phase transition curve in the CK plane. Before turning back to biology, it is essential to stress that the results noted above for synchronous Boolean networks extend to asynchronous Boolean networks and, more critically, extend to a family of model gene networks in which the genes have graded levels of activity. This is important because the on-o Boolean idealization is quite severe. Real genes show graded levels of activities as a function of the concentrations of their trans acting inputs and the bound states of their cis regulatory loci. If our results were fragile in that they depended upon the Boolean, on-o idealization, we could not trust them to inform us about real cells.
