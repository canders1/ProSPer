For example, in 1988, joint adoption of bar codes and EDI systems was uncommon: Only 25.2 percent of business units had adopted both, while 46.8 percent had adopted neither. [SEP] By 1992, three-quarters of the business units had implemented both bar codes and EDI technologies, while only 8.0 percent had neither in place. [SEP] Similar patterns of increased adoption can be seen among other combinations of these practices in Table 14.1. [SEP] The mere fact that two practices have been adopted, however, does not tell the whole story. [SEP] The changing organization of the retail and apparel industries also suggests that there is a particular sequence for adopting the four key practices. [SEP] To begin with, the adoption of bar codes	came	before rapid replenishment arrangements because retailers required a low-cost means of collecting information at the detailed product level for their own use—that is, they first developed an efficient method for scanning prices at the check-out register and tracking products for internal inventory purposes. [SEP] Only after a common convention for bar codes had been established and in use for several years did retailers turn to such systems to transmit and receive data from suppliers. [SEP] Indeed, the use of bar codes, followed by implementation of EDI systems, provides the basic foundation for subsequent investments in efficient logistics management in retail distribution centers. [SEP] Retailers do not get much out of investing in advanced distribution technologies, such as shipping cont	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch14.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
To be sure, the international sourcing arrangements that have been created by retailers and manufacturers over the last twenty years reflect a quest for minimizing unit labor costs. [SEP] But the long lead times they require will increasingly challenge such arrangements. [SEP] Manufacturers and retailers that rely on international sourcing will therefore have to reassess the total costs associated with offshore production and revise existing arrangements. [SEP] Trade data already suggest a major restructuring in the sources of U.S. apparel imports. [SEP] The surge in apparel imports in the 1980s	came	from low-wage countries, primarily the Asian “Big Four”—the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea. [SEP] This group of nations provided 39 percent of all apparel imports in 1964 and 51 percent of all apparel imports by 1988 (measured in square-meter equivalents, a measure of quantity). [SEP] But by 1996, the Big Four’s share of imports had fallen to 26 percent. [SEP] Their U.S. share has been increasingly displaced by those of Mexico and Caribbean nations.35 [SEP] Although these shifts in part reflect changes in U.S. trade policy, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), they fundamentally arise from new sourcing patterns attributable to channel integration and the consequent need for apparel items that can be delivered in a shorter time to the U.S. market	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
ages listed 24,000 items. [SEP] But Sears Roebuck and Co. outstripped Montgomery Ward in the 1890s. [SEP] As with the wholesaler-jobber and the emerging department stores, the buyers at Sears had full autonomy. [SEP] Chandler notes, “Each merchandise department was a separate dynasty, and the buyer was in complete charge.”8 Department stores and mail-order houses (and later chain stores in food distribution) dominated mass retailing after 1880 through large volume, high inventory turnover, lower prices, payments in cash that reduced the need for credit and debt, and the crucial role of the buyer. [SEP] Although wholesaler-jobbers had faded from the scene, the policies, practices, and administrative organizations of many mass distributors were derived from them. [SEP] Other buying practices	came	from small shops.

tinerant tailors or those in small shops. [SEP] The ready-made garment industry grew out of altered rejects and secondhand clothing that were then sold to the poorer classes in the cities. [SEP] In 1832, a 50 percent import duty curtailed clothing primarily from England and increased the demand for American home industry.10 [SEP] By 1850, the U.S. Census reports that there were 4,278 establishments with 97,000 workers—63 percent of them women—in the ready-made clothing industry.11 [SEP] Cloth was cut and assembled into bundles in these establishments, given out to workers to take home to sew, and returned for finishing operations.12 [SEP] With the invention of the sewing machine by Howe, and its perfection by Singer in 1851, a new era began in the manufacture of clothing, when more work be	came	concentrated in shops. [SEP] The Civil War and the consequent need for uniforms stimulated the factory system, and the introduction of standard body-size measurements facilitated ready-to-wear clothing. [SEP] When Hart, Schaffner, and Marx, for instance, opened its doors in 1879, only 40 percent of men’s suits were ready-made. [SEP] By 1920, most men wore suits that	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
eking lower labor costs, have moved to the American South and California. [SEP] But a disproportionate number of domestic apparel workers are still immigrants. [SEP] Given access to a large pool of immigrant labor in urban centers, the jobber-contractor system in women’s apparel led to the wide-scale presence and abuses of sweatshops. [SEP] Sweatshops at the turn of the century encompassed a range of workplaces in which, as one commentator noted, “Congestion, unsanitary quarters, lack of restriction on child labor, absolutely unregulated hours, and miserable pay combine to create a condition which endangers the lives not only of the workers, but of the purchasers of their products.”19 A study in 1893 of the “sweating system” estimated that one-half of the clothing manufactured at that time	came	from factories, while the other half originated in home work or was subcontracted in small shops often adjoining homes.20 [SEP] Organizing a relatively low-skill immigrant workforce presented great challenges to unions in the garment industry. [SEP] Employer resistance to unionization, arising from the highly competitive conditions in apparel markets and the significant percentage of total costs arising from labor, further compounded the problem. [SEP] This difficult environment shaped the organizing and representation strategies of the two major unions—the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and the International Ladies’ Garment Workers Union (ILGWU)21—as well as their relations with employers through collective bargaining arrangements.22 [SEP] Both unions established a foothold in the	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
EP] Cutters required substantial training, and the withdrawal of their labor could quickly shut down all sewing and pressing operations. [SEP] Because cutters worked on multiple layers of fabric at one time, their errors were likely to be costly. [SEP] Not surprisingly, cutters were the highest paid workers receiving day rates.23 [SEP] By organizing cutters first, unions gained the leverage with which they could then organize and represent the much larger, but less skilled, group of sewers who worked in factory settings, particularly in the men’s industry, or in the small shops that characterized the women’s industry. [SEP] The principal architects of this approach, Sidney Hillman, founding president of the Amalgamated, and David Dubinsky, long-time president of the ILGWU, were cutters and	came	out of this craft-group.24 [SEP] Given this union foothold, collective bargaining in apparel focused on the standardization of labor in a market area and a product line. [SEP] This was done because of the organization of work in clothing shops; the low capital costs and high proportion of labor costs, especially in women’s wear for contract shops; the intense product competition among manufacturers within and among geographic markets; and the diversity of products and changing styles. [SEP] The unions drew on several different methods to standardize wages and conditions within the markets. [SEP] For the ILGWU, standardizing wages required regulation through collective bargaining of the network of contractors and “submanufacturers” working for jobbers and manufacturers. [SEP] Emphasizing the	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
ing the relations among retail, apparel, and textile firms. [SEP] As Alfred Chandler and other business historians have made clear, successive changes in information exchange and transport over the last century have reshaped relations among industries, as well as the internal organization of these enterprises. [SEP] Chandler notes, Significantly, it was in several of these [labor-intensive] more fragmented industries—textiles, apparel, furniture, and some food processing—that the mass retailer (the department stores, mail-order houses and chain stores) began to coordinate the flow of goods from manufacturer to consumer. [SEP] In those industries where substantial economies of scale and scope did not exist in production, high-volume flows through the processes of production and distribution	came	to be guided—and the resulting cost reductions achieved—by the buying departments of mass retailers, retailers who handled a variety of related products through their facilities.43 [SEP] And so we arrive at the new information technologies of the 1980s. [SEP] These have begun to create integrated channels among enterprises in the three industries, facilitating even more product proliferation and stimulating changes in merchandising, inventory management, internal production practices, and methods of using human resources. [SEP] When it comes to the driving force behind the late twentieth-century industrial transformation, lean retailing is at the forefront of that revolution.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
The Growing Costs of Traditional Retailing Nevertheless, large-scale retailing	came	with its own risks. [SEP] Through their buying power, traditional retailers could dramatically lower the direct costs of procurement and, in the process, usurp the role of wholesalers in the apparel distribution system.9 [SEP] Purchasing in large quantities for their stores, however, subjected retailers to the attendant risk of selling “perishable” products like apparel. [SEP] The absence of business systems capable of adjusting to real-time demand information, as well as the lack of information between the time when orders were placed and the actual selling season, meant that early order commitments could not be amended pending new information.10 [SEP] In terms of the retail bottom line, this risk appeared in the indirect costs associated with holding inventories of unwanted products and s	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch3.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
 to track sales of its products on a real-time basis and manage its inventory accordingly. [SEP] In the words of Lou Pritchett, Procter & Gamble’s vice president of sales at the time, “P&G could monitor Wal-Mart’s inventory and data and then use that information to make its own production and shipping plans with a great deal more efficiency. We broke new ground by using information technology to manage our business together, instead of just to audit it.”32 The Wal-Mart/Procter & Gamble partnership has been often cited by the business press. [SEP] The program began through an informal discussion between Sam Walton and Procter & Gamble’s Pritchett. [SEP] Although the effort has been characterized as a partnership, senior executives at Procter & Gamble have also noted that the initial impetus	came	from Walton. [SEP] The partnership required Wal-Mart to switch from its internal proprietary standard to a more widely adopted electronic data interchange (EDI) standard, as well as to bar codes that were already in use by other retailers, particularly Kmart. [SEP] Although Kmart was the first major retailer to experiment with EDI, Wal-Mart led the way in structuring supply relationships and its overall competitive strategy around information exchange. [SEP] The program soon expanded to other vendors, including apparel suppliers, who entered their own “trading partnerships” with Wal-Mart. [SEP] Thus, what began as a system focused on efficient distribution eventually evolved into the modern system of lean retailing. [SEP] National Chains: J. C.

Department Stores: Dillard’s and Federated Although providing consumers with low prices for a limited range of goods underpins the strategy of mass merchants and national chains, department stores (going back to Wanamaker) rely on offering consumers a diverse and exciting collection of goods. [SEP] The focus of department stores tends to be on the middle and higher portion of the fashion triangle; consequently, lean retailing	came	later to this segment of the industry.

 a changing variety of apparel fashions and the need to increase its capacity to replenish a higher percentage of products, thereby taking advantage of its expertise in logistics.38 [SEP] Increasingly, a department store must be successful at both pursuits. [SEP] We discuss the trade-off arising from providing new products with little information on consumer demand (fashion products) and replenishing items on the basis of sales (historically limited to more basic products) in detail in Chapter 6. [SEP] Although Wal-Mart’s rapid climb has created the most sound and fury, a variety of retailers adopted and adapted different pieces of lean retailing in the early 1990s. [SEP] Note that the push toward rapid replenishment, reduction of lead times, and what has often been called “quick response”	came	predominately from retailers rather than from their apparel suppliers.39 [SEP] The next chapter analyzes the building blocks of lean retailing, drawing on the retailers described above as well as others. [SEP] Chapter 5 discusses how the retail revolution has led to a tremendous shift in bargaining power within the channel—away from manufacturers and suppliers and toward lean retailers.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch3.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
ad happened to an order was “It’s on the loading dock.” [SEP] Information systems at apparel factories were primitive. [SEP] If all the SKUs for an order were not in the warehouse, substitutions of the same style in a different size would be offered to the retailer. [SEP] Or retailers might not even notice if an unplanned substitution had been made because their information systems were equally as primitive. [SEP] If there were insufficient SKUs of the requested style, the order would be shorted or a phone call made to the retail buyer to negotiate a solution to the problem. [SEP] If no SKUs of the order were in the finished goods warehouse, then the search of the factory floor—where there might be tens of thousands of partially completed items to look through—would begin. [SEP] Then along	came	lean retailing and the need for rapid replenishment—manufacturers are now expected to replenish products in less than a week. [SEP] At first, only a few retailers required this, and apparel manufacturers tried to meet these needs with minimal changes in their internal practices. [SEP] Often, this was done at the expense of a manufacturer’s non-lean retail customers. [SEP] For example, the CEO of a men’s dress-shirt supplier reported to us in 1992 that its finished goods warehouse was divided into two areas. [SEP] A locked section contained finished goods reserved for orders from Dillard’s, Inc., this manufacturer’s biggest customer and its only one with stringent rapid-replenishment requirements. [SEP] The rest of the warehouse held inventory for all other retailers. [SEP] If the locked sec	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
Both components of total inventory (work-in-process and finished goods) decrease as the most profitable production shifts to the short-cycle plant. [SEP] Less finished goods inventory is required because finished goods can be rapidly replenished after a peak selling week. [SEP] Therefore, the amount of finished goods in the manufacturer’s distribution center needed to satisfy weekly demand for all SKUs depends on the cycle times of the plants supplying finished product, and what fraction of production is made in each plant. [SEP] In the single-breasted coat example of the previous section, there was only one plant involved, which made the most profitable target inventory level a single number for each SKU.13 [SEP] Increased profit	came	from missing fewer sales by being in stock a higher percentage of the time. [SEP] In the second case, the finished goods in the distribution center are generally a blend of the output of two plants and the target inventory level varies with the quick-line capacity ratio. [SEP] Most important, when a manufacturer considers two sourcing options, the one that offers the lowest direct cost is not always the most profitable.

pical. [SEP] The production marker for the intimate apparel item in Figure 8.2 was initially laid out by a trained operator with 79.96 percent utilization; the HCTAR software compacted the marker and achieved cloth utilization of 81.54 percent, an improvement of 1.47 percent. [SEP] One-third of the wholesale price of apparel is typically fabric cost. [SEP] A 1 percent savings in fabric over the entire production goes directly to the bottom line. [SEP] Such savings can add up to many millions of dollars for large manufacturers. [SEP] Based on our survey results, about two-thirds of the business units in 1992 generated markers by trained operators with computer assistance; when the survey response is weighted by dollars of yearly sales, however, 99.5 percent of the business units’ production	came	from computer-generated markers. [SEP] In contrast, apparel operations in developing nations generally do not use computerized layout systems. [SEP] Markers are made by hand, tracing pattern pieces onto sheets of paper from thick, pre-cut cardboard pattern elements. [SEP] The primary alignment tool is the meter stick for measuring distances from the edge. [SEP] It is not hard to imagine a tendency to allow a slight twist in individual pieces to achieve a closer fit between neighboring pieces. [SEP] There are also stories of subcontractors, in this country as well as overseas, crumpling a marker up so that when it is laid out again it will be just a little smaller in width and length—a trick to save a fraction of a percent from each piece.

sgresses, refusing to eat her vegetables or pick up her toys. [SEP] At the ﬁrst sign of misbehavior, Cara lectures in a tone of voice well beyond her years: “Children must obey their parents because their parents know things they don’t, so the parents must take care of them.” [SEP] As Cara’s pronouncement makes clear, play creates a “zone” through which preschoolers internalize a basic sense of social responsibility and morality. [SEP] At the same time, they acquire a wealth of practical knowledge and skills. [SEP] In extreme circumstances, when the organization and predictability of the real world fall apart, young children whose prior lives have been ﬁlled with parental warmth and involvement often call on rules and rituals in make-believe to restore their social world. [SEP] Recently, I	came	across the recollections of Alice Cahana, an elderly Holocaust survivor, recounting her days as a child in the death camp at Auschwitz. [SEP] Alice explained that she and her sister Edith managed despite all odds to stay together. [SEP] Their secret strategy was never to display any emotion that would give away their relationship, since a major objective of the SS was to break up families. [SEP] Only at night did they dare to hug, whisper, and play together. [SEP] On Friday nights, they marked the Sabbath in a special way, by imagining that they were at home. [SEP] They talked about the evening’s events in minute detail to make the image of family life ﬁrm and real.

ld, Sylvia was intensely jealous of her sickly younger brother for consuming so much of her mother’s attention. [SEP] While the baby nursed, Sylvia sat nearby on the ﬂoor, impatient and unhappy. [SEP] Her mother discovered that she could defuse Sylvia’s envy with a game in which Sylvia spread out the newspaper before her, picked out all the capital letters on the page, and pretended, in a very grown-up way, to read—an achievement that attracted much parental admiration. [SEP] Sylvia’s mother often made up bedtime tales, serialized from one evening to the next. [SEP] Almost as soon as they could talk, Sylvia and her brother responded in kind with limericks, poems, and fantastic stories of their own. [SEP] On walks to their grandparents’ house and on long car trips, favorite books invariably	came	along, offering ready inspiration for the children’s imaginative creations.54 [SEP] Filmstar Charlie Chaplin’s mother was herself a talented comedy actress and singer.

ns once fast-action video games have entered their households, many parents express another concern—that their children will become addicted to these violent amusements. [SEP] About 5 percent, usually boys, develop into “passionate,” or excessive, players during the elementary school years and desperately need parental intervention.93 [SEP] Compared to infrequent users, children highly involved in video games spend less time productively, more often watching cartoons and less often reading.94 [SEP] One parent whose son, Joey, spent his early childhood focused on play with Transformers and his school years immersed in video games complained about the boy’s mediocre grades and lamented, “Nothing seems to interest him.” [SEP] Joey spent so much time with highly stimulating video games that he	came	to regard slower-paced pursuits that require greater initiative to reach a goal as dull. [SEP] Of course, preschoolers—even those as young as age 3—beneﬁt from experience with computers as long as activities are constructive, adults are available to support them, and children are not diverted from other worthwhile activities. [SEP] But in homes in which family members are preoccupied with the computer, especially the Internet, time spent communicating and enjoying joint leisure activities declines.95 [SEP] Therefore, the computer’s value for acquiring new skills and information must be weighed against its potential for detracting from adult–child dialogues and other family activities.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
ortitude needed to rear a child with a difficult disposition. [SEP] Consider Carl, one of the most obstinate participants in a study of the combined impact that temperament and child rearing have on long-term development.28 [SEP] Beginning in infancy, Carl rejected many routines and experiences, including baths, bedtime, and new foods. [SEP] He shrieked, cried, and struggled to get away. [SEP] Yet his parents regarded his emotional intensity as a sign of inner strength and vigor. [SEP] They believed that if they were patient and ﬁrmly insistent, Carl would, in the end, adapt positively. [SEP] By the time Carl reached school age, he was doing remarkably well. [SEP] The energies he had previously invested in stubborn rebellion were channeled constructively. [SEP] He did well in school and be	came	enthusiastically involved in several activities. [SEP] One of these was playing the piano—lessons that he had asked for but (in his typical fashion) at ﬁrst disliked intensely.

La Adelita (Mexican Revolution Woman Soldier) A feminist symbol of the Mexican Revolution, La Adelita was the name of a woman soldier, a soldadera, who followed the troops, helped to set up camp, and cooked for the soldiers. [SEP] Some soldaderas were employed to cook and fulfil the needs of a particular soldier, whereas others were relatives or lovers. [SEP] The legend states that Adelita was a woman who fought in the Revolution, but it is not known if she actually existed as an individual; she	came	to epitomize all soldaderas and courageous women of that period. [SEP] In popular culture, literature, and the cinema, soldaderas have been portrayed as self-sacrificing women, usually mestizas (mixed-race women) from the lower classes, but La Adelita is often seen as a güera (light-skinned), “sweetheart of the troops, a woman who is valiant, pretty, and a wonderful helpmate to the soldier” (Salas 121). [SEP] Several corridos (ballads) have been written about her, and she is a powerful symbol for Mexican and Chicana women, representing bravery, self-discipline, and romantic love. [SEP] In fact, it is primarily through the corridos that Adelita is known today. [SEP] Historically, all soldaderas be	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
EP] The number of workers brought from Mexico ranged from a low of 4,180 in 1942 to a high of 62,091 in 1944. [SEP] It is estimated that by 1947 nearly 220,000 braceros had worked in the United States under this program. [SEP] It continued even after the war, and between 1955 and 1959 over 480,000 braceros were still working in the United States. [SEP] Some have compared the Bracero Program with legalized slavery, and the impact on the perception of the Mexican farmworker by American agribusiness has been to foster contempt and disdain. [SEP] Many braceros chose not to return to Mexico when their contracts ended and -instead stayed and hid from la migra, the feared Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). [SEP] Many Chicanos of the Southwest and Midwest are descendants of braceros who	came	to the United States and stayed, never returning to Mexico. [SEP] The bracero experience has been written about in novels and depicted in numerous movies, and although the image presented is often a negative one, like other Chicano folk heroes the bracero has become an archetype of the culture. [SEP] He is in the company of the historical mestizo character of Yo soy Joaquín, the revolutionary figure of Joaquín Murrieta, the mythical pachuco, the stately learned persona of Dr. Paredes, the gentle leadership of César Chávez; the bracero is the universally exploited farmworker, the campesino of the world.

Burritos Literally a little burro or little donkey, a burrito has come to mean a taco made of a wheat flour tortilla instead of a corn tortilla, filled with meat, rice, frijoles (beans), and chile, then folded and rolled up. [SEP] There are several theories about the origins of the name burrito, and there may be some truth to all of them. [SEP] One theory is that when flour tortillas be	came	available in northern Mexico, tacos de frijoles, or bean burritos, were easy to carry in the saddle-bags of the vaqueros (cowboys), so for this reason they	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
e Spaniards, and one can see that the flour tortilla is similar to the flat bread found in many Mediterranean countries. [SEP] Once flour tortillas were discovered, the move to making tacos from flour tortillas was logical. [SEP] Since corn tortillas are small, and can only bend or fold over once, and flour tortillas are more pliable and can be rolled several times, the flour taco was a natural outcome. [SEP] A burrito can be made with any type of filling, such as beans, potatoes, chile con carne, chile colorado, carnitas (chile with meat, red chile, roasted pork meat), or even peanut butter. [SEP] Flour tortillas and burritos are found in northern Mexico and the Southwest, but are not known in other parts of Mexico. [SEP] Since at least the 1920s, Chicanos from Texas have been making what	came	to be called burritos. [SEP] Originally they were called tacos; another story about the origin of the name is that in the 1940s there was an establishment in Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, called Los Burritos that sold tacos made of tortillas de harina (flour tortillas).

California Folklore The settlement of California by Spanish colonizers happened much later than in New Mexico and Texas. [SEP] The first Franciscan mission was established in San Diego in 1769, 200 years after the exploration of New Mexico. [SEP] A second great difference was that many of the Spanish settlers	came	by way of Mexico, so many of them represented a mestizo (mixed-race) culture rather than a purely sixteenth-century Spanish culture, as the earlier explorers had. [SEP] Many were Mexican Spaniards and of course did not bring the Spanish language and culture of the Golden Age of Spain with them. [SEP] Their Spanish language and culture had evolved into a slightly New World variant. [SEP] The population of California did not grow much during the eighteenth century, and after the independence of Mexico from Spain in 1821, Spanish culture quickly declined in the region. [SEP] Many Spaniards left the region, and the great migration of thousands of Anglo American gold seekers took place, so the Spanish culture and language could not survive in California as it did in Texas and New Mexico.

SEP] In sixteenth-century Europe a matachin was a masked dancer, an entertainer who danced with a sword. [SEP] It is likely that the Moors transplanted the dance to Europe and that matachin may come from the Arabic word mutawajjihin, meaning “to assume a mask.” [SEP] There are many eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary references to a matachine sword dance, indicating that such a dance was performed in Europe. [SEP] Similar to the dance-drama of Los Moros y Cristianos, the dance of Los Matachines was taught to the subjugated Indians by the Spanish missionaries as a custom to celebrate on Christian feast days but also as a means of converting them to Catholicism. [SEP] Flavia Waters Champe’s interpretation is that the dance was brought to New Mexico by Spanish and Mexican settlers who	came	with De Vargas at the time of the second conquest in 1692. [SEP] In New Mexico the dance group is open only to men and it is considered an honor to be a part of it. [SEP] The masked men, with decorated headdresses, dance in two parallel rows, in bright costumes decorated with long ribbons that appear to be a combination of Aztec and southwest Indian in origin. [SEP] The main characters in the drama are El Monarca, the King, who represents Montezuma, and four Capitanes. [SEP] The swords referred to earlier have become three-pronged palmas (palms) in the New World.

Lo Mexicano An expression and concept that	came	into usage in Mexico around 1900, but was not completely culturally defined until after the Mexican Revolution in the late 1920s. [SEP] The concept had to do with Mexican nationalism and a sense of self-identity with a Mexican consciousness. [SEP] The term conceptualized a new identity and an awareness of Mexicanness that was native, drawing on the indigenous and the mestizaje (mixed-race nature) of the country.

Joaquín Murrieta’s life has been depicted in novels, stories, newspaper serials, and movies. [SEP] Charles E. B. Howe wrote a play about Joaquín in 1859 that covers his escapades from the spring of 1851 to July 24, 1853, the day he was captured and killed by Captain Harry Love. [SEP] It is not known if the play was ever performed, but the portrayal of Murrieta is moving and especially interesting because of all the negative publicity following his capture and death. [SEP] Howe portrays him as an aristocratic intelligent leader and a man who commits crimes to avenge the wrongs committed against himself and his countrymen. [SEP] Joseph Henry Jackson’s work traces the history of the legend, claiming all the information	came	from the John Rollin Ridge version and that he should be credited with starting the “fictitious” legend. [SEP] Although Jackson does quote from the San Francisco Alta newspaper demonstrating that many people suspected it was not Joaquín Murrieta who was killed and decapitated by Captain Harry Love, but quite possibly another Joaquín, “every murder and robbery in the country has been attributed to ‘Joaquín.’ Sometimes it is Joaquín Carrillo that has committed all these crimes; then it is Joaquín Murrieta, then Joaquín something else, but always Joaquín!” (Jackson, 13). [SEP] Marcus Stewart wrote a long epic poem in 1882 titled Rosita, A California Tale, in which he speculates on the life of Murrieta.

 songs, proverbs, superstitions, riddles, children’s games, and much more. [SEP] Students who were trained by Espinosa and who later continued folkloric work in New Mexico were Arthur Campa, Juan B. Rael, and Espinosa’s son, Jose Manuel Espinosa, who published Spanish Folk-tales from New Mexico in 1937. [SEP] Rael published Cuentos Españoles de Colorado y Nuevo Mejico in 1957, which is considered by Américo Paredes to be one of the best collections of Mexican folk narrative. [SEP] Campa’s work includes collections of folk poetry, riddles, folk songs, and folk drama from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, published mostly in the 1940s and 1950s. [SEP] John Donald Robb (1892–1989) collected folk songs throughout New Mexico in the 1940s and 1950s using wire recorders. [SEP] He	came	to the University of New Mexico as chair of the music department in 1941. [SEP] He was a composer and educator but always had an interest in folk music. [SEP] The John Donald Robb Archive of Southwestern Music is located at the university’s library. [SEP] His two books on New Mexico are Hispanic Folk Songs of New Mexico (1954) and Hispanic Folk Music of New Mexico and the Southwest: A Self Portrait of a People (1980). [SEP] Hispanic women have always been involved in creative and artistic work in New Mexico even up until contemporary times. [SEP] Although there have been many publications about the santeros (saint makers), wood-carvers, tinsmiths, and other male artists, very little has been written about the work accomplished by women.

 located in Santa Fe. [SEP] Marianne Stoller writes of the work of New Mexican women artists and why they have been left out of history. [SEP] Several New Mexican women who descended from the early Spanish settlers of the region wrote personal life histories that incorporated the traditional way of life of the Hispano community of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. [SEP] Fabiola Cabeza de Baca, Nina Otero-Warren, and Cleofas Jaramillo each produced several books that present the folklore, rituals, and customs of the New Mexicans. [SEP] Rebolledo discusses how these women used their writings as “narrative strategies of resistance” because they saw their culture and way of life slowly eroding away and being assimilated by a dominant and foreign culture. [SEP] Because they all	came	from upper-class families, they were educated in Spanish traditions and language and consequently ignored the mestizo (mixed-race) and indigenous aspects of the culture, often depicting their past in romantic pastoral terms. [SEP] Nevertheless, they all wrote of the loss of land and loss of culture, and sought to preserve the folklore, customs, and stories of their grandparents, close friends, and those who worked for them. [SEP] The Penitentes, the ancient religious brotherhood, have attracted much research and been scrutinized by many writers and journalists.

The chant states that they’re angels from heaven and are asking for gifts, although if they receive none, they may break doors and windows. [SEP] The origin of this custom is not known, but some believe it is to remind society that the stranger at the door should not be forgotten. [SEP] Lorin Brown reports that in northern New Mexico the children went out on Christmas Eve, but in Canutillo, Texas, around the 1920s, it was the custom for children to go door to door on Christmas Day, although they didn’t recite the above chant. [SEP] The neighbors expected them and were ready with gifts of fruits and candies. [SEP] Lottie C. Devine makes reference to the Papago Indians in Arizona, saying that on “Christmas Day most of them	came	to town, all dressed in party clothes, and went from house to house ‘calling Christmas.’ Everyone gave them candies and apples and many of them in turn gave baskets or pottery” (29). [SEP] Cabeza de Baca refers to this custom as aguinaldos, and the chant she records is similar to the one above, except that the last line is “A pedir Aguinaldos y Oremos.” [SEP] Aguinaldos are gifts given during the Christmas season.

Pachucos (-as) (1940s Urban Youth) A name adopted by Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals to designate those who make up a fascinating urban subculture, detached from U.S. culture and from Mexican American urban life also. [SEP] The first appearance of pachucos was in the El Paso–Juárez area during the 1920s and early 1930s. [SEP] It is thought the word pachuco was a colloquial way of referring to El Paso. [SEP] A person from El Paso was referred to as del pachuco. [SEP] Sometimes a person considered a pachuco was called a chuco. [SEP] Haldeen Braddy discusses the origin of the word pachuco, providing several theories. [SEP] One is that the pachucos of the 1930s	came	from the city of Pachuca in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. [SEP] He also pre-sents the definition from the Diccionario General de Americanismos, stating that pachuca is a five-card poker hand in which all the cards are of different suits, or in other words, a poker hand with no value, a losing hand. [SEP] Braddy believes this well describes the pachucos of El Paso (1971). [SEP] The other theory is that pachuco comes from the Nahuatl word pachtli, which refers to a grass like hay that grows parasitically on trees. [SEP] Pachucos were identifiable by their clothing, hairstyles, and a distinct language with its own vocabulary. [SEP] The men wore “zoot suits,” that is, pegged pants, long coats with padded shoulders, and pancake hats.

Pochismos (Americanisms) A term that describes the use of English expressions in Spanish, or Americanisms interjected into conversations when speaking Spanish. [SEP] Sometimes this kind of speech is called Spanglish, or Chicano Spanish, or just pocho talk. [SEP] Examples of some pochismos are words such as parkear, meaning to park (the car), and wachar, meaning to watch (hay te wacho, “I’ll see you”), also spelled guachate, meaning “watch out.” [SEP] Other simpler examples are dona for doughnut, el dompe for the dump, troque for truck, and yarda for yard. [SEP] According to Manuel Peña the word jaitón, meaning “snobbish,” evolved from the words “high tone” when one was discussing music. [SEP] It	came	to be used to mean pretentious high class, as in “se crea muy jaitona” (she thinks she’s real high-class), but at the same time it can mean that one has elegance or style. [SEP] Various dictionaries of Chicano Spanish and Chicano slang have been compiled that list many other pochismos. [SEP] Chicano novelists and poets have consciously incorporated the use of pochismos in literary works to reinforce the precarious cultural and linguistic status of Chicanos in American society.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
 Sun) The narrative of the Fifth Sun is based on an Aztec myth that has become an important cultural expression commonly incorporated into Chicano cultural events. [SEP] The first publisher of contemporary Chicano literature in the 1960s, based in Berkeley, California, was named Quinto Sol Publications. [SEP] Worship of the sun was an integral part of Aztec culture. [SEP] The sun was viewed as a warrior with the solar rays as his darts. [SEP] Time consisted of a fifty-two-year calendar that was divided into five ages, or series of ages, called Suns. [SEP] The first age was the Age of the Earth Sun, and the god was Tezcatlipoca, whose familiar animal was the jaguar. [SEP] The second age was the Age of Great Winds, the sun was Quetzalcoatl, and the age ended with great hurricanes. [SEP] Then	came	the Age of Fire with the sun Tlaloc, and it ended with volcanic eruptions. [SEP] Next was the Age of Floods with the goddess of waters, Chalchiuhtlicue, as the fourth sun. [SEP] This age ended when the sky fell upon the earth and the waters gushed up, turning men into fish. [SEP] The present and fifth age, El Quinto Sol, has Nanahuatl, also known as Tonatiuh, as the god, and it is the Age of Earthquakes.

It is accepted that the word ranchera refers to a type of Mexican song, although sometimes it is an adjective that describes a character or a type of person. [SEP] Ranchera comes from the word rancho, meaning a “cattle ranch, farm, or rural settlement.” [SEP] A poor unsophisticated person may be called a ranchero or ranchera, implying he or she is from the countryside, the sticks, and a hick. [SEP] In the context of Mexican folk music la canción ranchera is a love song, sung by the common folk, the peasants of the rural countryside. [SEP] After the Mexican Revolution rancheras be	came	more agreeable to the upper classes because of the movement toward a Mexican identity and nationalism and a rejection of European cultural values. [SEP] The modern canción ranchera was made popular in Mexico City in the early 1950s by the songwriter José Alfredo Jimenez. [SEP] The poetic structure of the ranchera is brief and simple, yet emotionally it is very intense. According to Rubén Campos as quoted by Gradante, “it is a moan and a sigh . . . , the briefest form of composition and, as such, requires a greater intensity of expression than any other compositional form. It must say precisely what it means” (1983, 105). [SEP] The themes of rancheras are love and unrequited love, but from the point of view of the ordinary common man.

Rio Grande Blankets A Rio Grande blanket was a blanket woven in New Mexico during the nineteenth century that was meant to be worn during the day and used as bedding at night. [SEP] Blankets were woven before this period, actually since the seventeenth century, but not many survived from the period of 1600 to 1800. [SEP] The Rio Grande blanket has particular characteristics, with designs that include wide bands and various zones of narrow stripes. [SEP] During the early 1800s the wool was not dyed and was left in colors of brown and white. [SEP] It was called churro (a kind of sheep) wool, because it	came	from the common sheep introduced by the Spaniards. [SEP] Later, the wool was combined with natural dyed yarns of indigo. [SEP] This wool was woven on a narrow treadle loom. [SEP] The designs for the Rio Grande blankets are very distinct, with indigo-dyed stripes, and later were influenced by Saltillo sarape motifs that were introduced in the late 1800s. [SEP] There was much borrowing and exchange of materials, fibers, and dyes between the Pueblo Indians and the Spanish in the textile weaves of New Mexico. [SEP] The Saltillo sarape motif has a large complex diamond in the central layout of the blanket, and sometimes is surrounded by a scalloped border.

owboy, the vaquero, and the buckaroo. [SEP] The vaquero was originally Hispanic or Mexican, or Indian, and herded cattle in the Far West in the states of California, Nevada, Oregon, Arizona, Utah, and Washington, whereas the cowboys who herded cattle in the southern states were usually Negro or Anglo. [SEP] The vaquero or buckaroo is a westerner and the cowboy is a southerner. [SEP] The definition is a territorial one, with the cowboy working east of the Rockies and the vaquero west of the Rockies. [SEP] It is this difference that Rojas writes about in his three-volume memoir of the California vaquero. [SEP] Anglos coined the word buckaroo, meaning vaquero, because they disliked the word cowboy and did not want to call themselves by that name. [SEP] Somehow when they pronounced vaquero, it	came	out of their mouths as “buckaroo.” [SEP] The California Indians were trained by the Spanish missionaries to herd cattle, and they were the primary vaqueros until the mid-1800s. [SEP] Mexicans from Sonora took over as vaqueros when they started migrating into California in the nineteenth century. [SEP] The style of horse riding instituted by the Spaniards was called la jinete, a term that relates to the equipment used in riding. [SEP] It not only includes the bits, spurs, and the saddles, but also the length of the stirrups, how the reins are held, and the amount of pressure of the knees on the horse.

[SEP] On the second try Juan Diego saw the bishop, his story was heard and questioned, but was not believed. [SEP] The bishop wanted a sign from the Great Lady so that he would know it was really she who was sending Juan Diego. [SEP] Diego intended to go back to Tepeyac and inform the beautiful woman, but when he returned home he found that his uncle Juan Bernardino was extremely ill. [SEP] The next morning, on December 12, as he walked to Tlatelolco to call a priest to come to his uncle’s side, the beautiful woman	came	to him a third time asking what was wrong. [SEP] Diego told her of his sick uncle and of the request from the bishop. [SEP] She told him his uncle was now well and would not die and sent him to the top of a hill to cut fresh flowers that he was to take to the bishop as proof of her existence. [SEP] Diego followed her instructions and at the top of the hill he found beautiful roses of Castile, still covered with dew. [SEP] He cut them and The Lady, the Mother of God, arranged them in his tilma (cloak) and sent him to the bishop, with the proof requested.

[SEP] In her book The Good Life, Fabiola Cabeza de Baca has a brief chapter on wedding traditions, including recipes and a detailed description of the preparation of the food. [SEP] When a couple married, three main ceremonies took place. [SEP] These were initiated after the groom and his family had asked the girl’s family for her hand in marriage. [SEP] If the girl or her family refused the offer, she would send a letter to her suitor with her negative response. [SEP] This was termed as giving cala-bazas (squash or pumpkin) and was a great insult to the wooer. [SEP] Of the ceremonies, first there was el día del prendorio (day of the engagement), when the bride and groom	came	together publicly for the first time. [SEP] A great celebration would take place, usually in the home of the bride, with food, drinks, and music. [SEP] This festivity would be equivalent to an engagement party. [SEP] The day of the wedding was called el día del casorio and could last from two to three days. [SEP] The upper classes held lavish wedding ceremonies that would last for days with lots of music and food for their many guests; the poorer folks also followed many of the same traditions, although in a more modest fashion. [SEP] It was the tradition that the bridegroom’s family hosted the celebration after the church service. [SEP] There was always an orchestra that played while the guests ate, and a big dance on the eve of the wedding day.

But whatever his fate, he has stood up for his right” (149). [SEP] When the book was published it caused quite a stir in Texas because of its negative portrayal of the Texas Rangers. [SEP] The chief editor at the University of Texas Press asked Paredes to delete his critical references to Walter Prescott Webb, J. Frank Dobie, and the Texas Rangers. [SEP] The book was eventually published in spite of his refusal to make any changes. [SEP] The timing of its publication was crucial, in 1958, for its powerful influence on Chicano students and intellectuals, since it	came	out just before the start of the Chicano movement of the 1960s. [SEP] Its intellectual and political impact on a whole generation of Chicano scholars cannot be overstated. [SEP] Almost all publications on Chicanos and Mexicanos up to that date had been written by Anglo American sociologists or anthropologists, and the few published Hispano scholars, such as Aurelio Espinosa and Arthur Campa, were only known within a narrow circle of folklore specialists.

s not that of those who first engage in the practice but rather of those who witness the pattern of the past and adopt it as binding on themselves. [SEP] So it is with the Gettysburg Address. [SEP] The right question is not what Lincoln intended, but rather what the words meant to those who looked to them as the explanation of the war and as a charter for freedom and equality for all Americans. [SEP] If the address had been ignored, it would not have mattered what Lincoln intended. [SEP] But because these 268 words20 were adopted into the civil religion of the United States—the secular meditation on who we were and what we were about—their life after formal recitation by the president determines their constitutional status. [SEP] They are the preamble to the constitutional order because we	came	to understand them as nearly sacred. [SEP] And although we did not until now think of this secular prayer as the preamble to a new order of nationhood, equality, and democracy, that is what they be	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] He treated the founding charter of the government more as a guideline to action than as a set of absolute restrictions on his actions. [SEP] His decisions, particularly in the early stages of the war, suggest a willingness to assert extraconstitutional executive power and, thus, to permit the exigencies of war to restructure the government. [SEP] In April 1861, in the immediate shadow of the shelling of Fort Sumter, he declared a blockade on Southern ports.

he writ of habeas corpus (“it relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent”) reveals a lack of appreciation for the point of constitutional protections in criminal procedure. [SEP] My own reading is that Lincoln’s suspending the writ on his own initiative and disregarding Taney’s supposed invalidation of the decision testifies to an altered state of constitutional thinking. [SEP] The Constitution of 1787 lay suspended in the fires of battle. [SEP] A new constitutional order would arise from the war, but no one quite knew what shape it would take. [SEP] Of course, during the war, the 1787 Constitution remained nominally in force. [SEP] There was little suggestion of a “military dictatorship,” though some Northern critics of the government invoked the phrase. [SEP] Lincoln’s elected term	came	to an end in March 1865. [SEP] In the midst of the war, therefore, he was constitutionally required to stand for reelection. [SEP] This event in itself warranted the stability of American institutions, but still ambiguity reigned on the shape of the postbellum constitutional order. [SEP] The confusion	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
 of a belief in the equality of all humanity. [SEP] The American Revolution took the first step by abolishing the privileges of the nobly born. [SEP] The 1787 Constitution prohibits both the states and the federal government from granting “titles of nobility.”8 There was this much equality in the founding, but anchoring the “peculiar institution” of slavery in the Constitution was the great “offence” against equality that could be expiated only on the killing fields of Gettysburg and Antietam. [SEP] The postbellum history of the United States has carried the egalitarian message of Gettysburg into the liberation of ever more marginal groups. [SEP] After the emancipation of blacks, the movement for women’s suffrage gained strength and finally triumphed in 1920, and then in unclear succession	came	the contemporary efforts toward the equal treatment of homosexuals, “illegitimate” children, the handicapped, and even undocumented aliens.9 [SEP] The thrust toward inclusion of more and more groups within the inner circle of the equally privileged has been one of the central themes of American life. [SEP] Yet, even the victory of the Civil War is not yet complete. [SEP] The badges and vestiges of slavery still haunt the land. [SEP] The quest for redemption from the original sin of slavery continues in our own time. [SEP] Our sensibilities are conditioned by our history. [SEP] But, however difficult the struggle, we have a history of which we can be proud. [SEP] We Americans were the first to conceptualize the great maxim of equality and to label it a self-evident truth.

Equality before the law is the most limited claim of human equality. [SEP] This form of equality applies only to fellow nationals and residents subject to the same legal order. [SEP] More ambitious are the arguments of the philosophers such as Ackerman and Rawls who claim that equality is the first principle of social justice. [SEP] At the outer reaches of principle, we find the great maxim invoked in the Gettysburg Address: All human beings are equal in the sight of God. [SEP] Let us limit our thinking, for the time being, to the most modest claim—that all individuals, black and white, men and women, gay and straight, born in wedlock and out of wedlock, should be treated equally under the law. [SEP] We did not recognize this principle in the 1787 Constitution. [SEP] It	came	into our positive law—the law actually applied by the courts—in 1868 with the Fourteenth Amendment. [SEP] But what is the grounding for this transformation in our attitudes toward equality under law? [SEP] Did we need the more radical faith in equality in the sight of God to discover the imperative of treating everyone equally under the law? [SEP] Is equality under law limited to Americans? [SEP] If so, why does the Fourteenth Amendment literally protect all “persons” against the American states that deprive them of equal protection of the laws? [SEP] These are the difficult issues to which we now turn. [SEP] The Nation as the Crucible	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
Andrew Johnson’s plan for Reconstruction was plagued by controversies about whether the previously disloyal were still full members of the nation and whether blacks, once emancipated, should ascend a step higher and receive the franchise on equal terms with whites. [SEP] Lincoln imagined grounding the equality between black and white, Northern and Southern, in a shared sense of nationhood. [SEP] With the rancorous infighting that dominated Congress in the period 1865 to 1870, the relevance of nationhood began to recede. [SEP] More important were the ideological issues of loyalty, personal desert, and political self-interest. [SEP] The question of the black franchise be	came	associated with the fears of Democrats that a coalition of freedmen and Republicans would dominate the postbellum South.

But this should not surprise us. [SEP] Politics merely occupies the surface of our lives. [SEP] The give-and-take of daily conflict can lead us easily to forget both our shared purposes and our enduring principles. [SEP] The Civil War had ushered in a commitment to the equality of all members of the nation. [SEP] Whatever the struggle for adoption may have been, the language of egalitarian principle	came	into force. [SEP] By 1868, we had in place a clause in the Fourteenth Amendment that was unique in American constitutional history: no state could “deprive any person of the equal protection of the laws.” [SEP] What this clause would imply in practice, no one quite knew. [SEP] We did know, however, that the legal idea of equality carried no historical gloss. [SEP] The Constitution had already spoken of “privileges and immunities”12 and the Bill of Rights, of securing “life, liberty, and property” against deprivation “without due process of law.”13 But the Constitution had never before contained the notion of equality of persons before the law.

hich the rebellious states were expected to ratify as the price for reinstating their right to representation in Congress, included a clause disqualifying from public office, in either the states or the federal government, anyone who had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution and thereafter “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.”2 This provision could conceivably have rid the South of those who supported the war for Southern independence, but it could not liberate the North from its judges and politicians who were ambivalent about the equality of all citizens. [SEP] The membership of the Supreme Court changed entirely between the time of the Dred Scott decision in 1857 and the first major constitutional decision of the postbellum period in 1872. [SEP] Yet, the judges who	came	onto the court still carried with them the values and confusions of their antebellum youth. [SEP] They could not easily imbibe an entirely new spirit of nationhood and a strong commitment to equality. [SEP] Their justice did not express the vision of the victor but rather the reluctant judgment from within that the vanquished, too, had arguments on their side. [SEP] Securing a nominal legal change in the form of the black-letter rules of constitutional revisions was not so difficult. [SEP] The Thirteenth Amendment was ratified as soon as the war was over, and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth followed within five years. [SEP] By 1870, the language of revolutionary change was in place.

n of Gettysburg, with a new generation unaffected by old habits of thought, Lincoln’s prophecy at Gettysburg might have prevailed. [SEP] The commitment to “a single nation” of black and white would have provided the foundation for a jurisprudence of equality in the courts. [SEP] The federal government would have become the watchdog of private relationships that approached too close to the forbidden line, defined in the Thirteenth Amendment as “slavery” or “previous condition of servitude.” [SEP] The “self-evident truths” of the Declaration of Independence—the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness—could have generated the foundation of a new constitutional order. [SEP] Yet, this was not to be the fate of postbellum America. [SEP] Part of the problem is the way we	came	to think of the great sacrifice that occurred on the battlefields of Gettysburg, Antietam, Vicksburg—all the places where Americans rushed to give their lives for the sake of vague principles. [SEP] If we did not have the great articulation of the war’s aim that Lincoln gave us at Gettysburg, the entire enterprise would have reeked of the absurd. [SEP] “I am fighting for my rights,” a Confederate soldier might have said—not too sure what those “rights” were. [SEP] On the other side, in blue rather than gray, he might have said, “I am fighting for the Union” with the nagging sense that dying for a governmental structure was slightly ridiculous.

The party of Lincoln be	came	the radicals in Congress, and Lincoln’s successor, Andrew Johnson, himself from Tennessee with roots in the yeomanry of the former Confederacy, was less eager than Congress to effectuate a cleansing of the governments that had supported the rebellion. [SEP] He was opposed to the Fourteenth Amendment, which would have subjected the states to continuing federal scrutiny, and he was at odds with Lincoln’s secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, who concurred in the effort to seek radical reconstruction of the South. [SEP] Fearing that Johnson would fire Stanton, Congress passed a statute requiring congressional approval to remove a member of the presidential cabinet. [SEP] Johnson resisted; he fired his secretary of war. [SEP] In retaliation, the House began impeachment proceedings.

Behind the Sturm und Drang of the nation’s first impeachment trial was a struggle for power between the Congress and the presidency. [SEP] Would the constitutional structure that emerged from the war more closely resemble the European style of parliamentary democracy, with the executive cabined by congressional directives? [SEP] Or would the presidency remain an independent third force of government? [SEP] Wars have a way of throwing open basic questions of this sort, and by unleashing aggression within a society, a Civil War inevitably invites a redefinition of governmental power. [SEP] Thus, a whole new set of issues	came	onto the agenda of constitutional discussion. [SEP] Among the most important of these was the proper relationship between the federal government and the states. [SEP] This is the question of “federalism” that still preoccupies American constitutional lawyers. [SEP] There is no doubt that the federal government	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
Among the most important of these was the proper relationship between the federal government and the states. [SEP] This is the question of “federalism” that still preoccupies American constitutional lawyers. [SEP] There is no doubt that the federal government	came	out of the war more powerful than ever. [SEP] It had experimented with an income tax and, therefore, could look forward to more effective funding. [SEP] It had coordinated the armies of the states and now it would undertake to guide the redevelopment and integration of the South in a society governed by a new set of values. [SEP] The question now was whether under a new governmental structure with Washington at its head, the individual states could nourish the principle that they were the residual source of governmental power as set forth in the Tenth Amendment, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” [SEP] In 1791, when the Bill of Rights was ratified, it made sense f	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
her extreme, the other points on this spectrum represent a mix of private decision making and government policies. [SEP] In fitting the Fourteenth Amendment to the reality of these diverse combinations, the Court could have insisted on stage six as the threshold of behavior included within the scope of the amendment, thus limiting the supervisory power of the federal courts to the official action of state officials. [SEP] But it was clear from the outset that this would make little sense. [SEP] Discriminatory application of sound laws could not escape federal scrutiny simply because state officials acted beyond the scope of their authority. [SEP] Limiting “state action” and official policies of the state would encourage officials to act beyond their legal competence. [SEP] Thus, stage five	came	to be included within the ambit of state responsibility. [SEP] The fatal mistake in 1883 was concluding that everything below stage five could properly be classified as private or “social.” [SEP] Justice Harlan’s dissent stresses that stages two, three, and four are also actions in the public domain that implicate the state in various ways—as enforcer, as beneficiary of the surrogate private enterprise, or by direct or indirect funding (e.g., tax incentives). [SEP] Reading the Fourteenth Amendment with a view to what it was intended to accomplish would have yielded a more generous understanding of “state action.” [SEP] The range of constitutionally relevant action would have included at least actions fulfilling the public functions of providing transportation, accommodations for travelers, 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
ple” is absent in the rhetoric of his dissenting opinion. [SEP] The problem he addressed was not one that the people could decide for themselves. [SEP] The question “Who constitutes the nation?” does not lend itself to democratic resolution. [SEP] The question of nationhood logically precedes both government and the popular will. [SEP] For the nation to express itself as “government of the people,” it must first come into being. [SEP] The nation does not constitute itself by popular vote or by a decision of government. [SEP] The nation comes alive, as Lincoln viewed our history, as a bond forged in an historical struggle. [SEP] The bond was first cast in 1774 with the first stirring of independence or, at the latest, in July 1776. [SEP] The inclusion of emancipated slaves within the nation	came	as the only consequence of the Brothers’ War that could make sense of the national search for redemption. [SEP] Remarkably, the eight justices who signed the Court’s opinion invalidating the Civil Rights Act of 1875 used the vocabulary neither of peoplehood nor of nationhood. [SEP] They had no conception of the American nation—or at least not one relevant to their legal analysis. [SEP] Of course, they refer to the national government, a phrase in which “national” is synonymous with “federal” or “central.” [SEP] Yet, they use the term “nation” in reference to France!52 I suppose that in the minds of the majority of justices, the United States constituted not a nation but a people still living under the Constitution they had designed and ratified in the 1780s.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
a single nation. [SEP] It would take a campaign of restaurant sit-ins and bus boycotts finally to correct the great error of the Civil Rights Cases. [SEP] In 1964, four-score-years-and-one after the initial defeat in the Supreme Court, the country could once again say that equal access to theaters and public accommodations was the law of the land. [SEP] If we look at the legacy of the Slaughterhouse Case and the Civil Rights Cases together, we should note two additional casualties to the vision of a new postbellum legal order. [SEP] In the first case, counsel raised the issue of economic discrimination, which had never received due attention from the Supreme Court. [SEP] We turn in the next chapter to the legacy of that failure in ongoing economic discrimination in education. [SEP] As race	came	center stage in the truncated arena of “equal protection,” the Supreme Court would ignore the tragedies of the states’ toleration of wealth and class discrimination. [SEP] As we shall see, other countries have confronted the problem of wealth discrimination as an aspect of their commitment to equality. [SEP] It will eventually be incumbent on the Supreme Court to do the same. [SEP] The second major casualty was the concept of “involuntary servitude” as invoked in the Thirteenth Amendment. [SEP] Counsel tried, but they could not persuade the Supreme Court to think of the burdens imposed on the New Orleans butchers and on African Americans subject to public segregation as variations of the servitudes prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment. [SEP] That concept had the potential of inducing a ne	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
digm of impermissible domination. [SEP] And the other paradigm of coerced servitude would have been the domination of blacks by whites in a segregated society. [SEP] Had these two decisions gone the other way, a triadic relationship with government would have emerged. [SEP] The triangle would have consisted in the potentially dominant private party, the potentially subservient private party, and the government as the guarantor of relationships of equality and nondomination. [SEP] It is not clear which branch of the federal government would have benefited most from a triadic relationship with private parties. [SEP] Congress would have exercised its authority to legislate under the Thirteenth Amendment. [SEP] The executive would have established commissions to keep tabs on relationships that	came	to public attention. [SEP] Although the judiciary probably would have prospered as well, the Supreme Court of the 1870s and 1880s did not want to see the federal government become the watchdog of economic and semipublic racial relationships. [SEP] Our history took a different course, one that required us to confront, in ways that we hardly expected, the moral difficulties of understanding equality under law.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
stitution. [SEP] A clear commitment to a universal right to vote finally takes hold. [SEP] The franchise attaches not to those with qualifications, education, wealth, age, or even the supposed superiority that, according to the attitudes of 1920, men enjoyed in practical affairs. [SEP] The franchise belongs to all Americans and even to resident noncitizens who are capable of knowing, in the minimal theory of democratic voting, when “the shoe pinches.”7 Lincoln’s vision of government “by all the people” was becoming the law of the land. [SEP] Also, elections for the presidency begin to take on the quality of a national referendum in place of a compilation of preferences by the individual states. [SEP] People started voting and expressing themselves as the voice of the nation. [SEP] Thus, it	came	to be obvious that citizens of the country who did not reside in the states (namely, those in the federal district) must also have the right to vote for national offices.

[SEP] As we shall see, the best data now suggest that precisely such a power law distribution of extinction and speciation events has occurred over the past 650 million years of the Phanerozoic. [SEP] In addition, the same body of theory predicts that most species go extinct soon after their formation, while some live a long time. [SEP] The predicted species lifetime distribution is a power law. [SEP] So too are the data. [SEP] Similar phenomena may occur in an econosphere.

The equation F = MA is a definitional circle, according to Poincaré. [SEP] Many physicists disagree with Poincaré. [SEP] I tend to agree, but then I am not a physicist, so take care. [SEP] On the other hand, the great twentieth-century philosopher Ludwig Witt-gen-stein said something similar in his majestic Philosophical Investigations. [SEP] Witt-genstein	came	to his revolutionary investigations painfully, ultimately rejecting his own earlier triumph in the Tractatus. [SEP] Indeed, part of why I have so blatantly borrowed Wittgenstein’s title, without my presumption to similar intellectual stature, is that there is a parallel between Wittgenstein’s abandonment of the Tractatus and growing awareness of knowing as living a language game, and a central theme of this Investigations, that there may be a limit to the way Newton taught us to do science and a need to reformulate what we do when we and other agents get on with living a life. [SEP] As we will see, in both cases, it appears that something profound is going on in the universe that is not finitely prestatable.

[SEP] Now try to translate the statement into a set of statements about ordinary human actions, “A group of twelve people were seated behind a wooden enclosure for several days. People talked about someone having died of poison. One day, the twelve people left the room and went to another room and talked about what had happened. Then the twelve people	came	back and one man stood up and uttered the words, ‘We find Henderson guilty of murder.’” There is no finitely prespecifiable list of statements about ordinary human actions whose truth would be necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement that the jury found Henderson guilty of murder.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
Indeed, Hume’s injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements. [SEP] We scientists find the facts. [SEP] You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics. [SEP] But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is, where do values come from at all? [SEP] Hume’s injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category “ought.” [SEP] The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long, twisted, arduous. [SEP] Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful, philosophers as famous as G. E. Moore	came	to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances. [SEP] “It is wrong to kill.” [SEP] Becomes, “Agggah!” [SEP] Does the positivist argument seem persuasive? [SEP] It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists, “only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful,” is itself not empirically verifiable. [SEP] One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards. [SEP] John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all “contractually” agree to, were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments.

Hierarchies of Autonomous Agents For a start, there appears to be an indefinite hierarchy of autonomous agents. [SEP] At least in our biosphere, there is a considerable hierarchy of autonomous agents. [SEP] Consider first a single-cell organism, prokaryote, cells without nuclei such as E. coli in your gut. [SEP] E. coli, my canonical autonomous agent. [SEP] Next, consider a eukaryote, yeast, also in your gut, also an autonomous agent. [SEP] In the passage from prokaryote to eukaryotic cell, it appears that a collection of autonomous agents	came	to live together permanently. [SEP] Eukaryotes contain mitochondria, and plant cells contain plastids with chlorophyll. [SEP] In both cases, these intracellular organelles carry their own DNA, with a slightly modified genetic code in the case of mitochondria. [SEP] These facts have suggested to Lynn Margulis the now rather well-accepted hypothesis that eukaryotic cells are symbionts of two or more earlier separate autonomous agents that contributed the mitochondria, the plastids, and perhaps the nuclear structure of eukaryotes into a single novel reproducing entity, the eukaryotic cell. [SEP] The eukaryotic cell, then, is a well-behaved society of autonomous agents that are now symbiotic, hence, the eukaryotic cell is a higher-order autonomous agent, comprised of lower-order autonomous agen	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
We have beginning mathematical models that reveal something about this hierarchical organization = although the best current models are curiously limited despite their brilliance. [SEP] Walter Fontana is a theoretical chemist trained by Peter Schuster in Vienna. [SEP] Walter	came	to the Santa Fe Institute and made a major intellectual step called “Alchemy.” [SEP] In chapter 2, I described the emergence of autocatalytic sets of molecular species in a chemical reaction graph. [SEP] By rather independent intellectual routes that began with physicist John McCaskill’s eVorts to create a computer soup of Turing machines that “operated” on one another, Walter invented “algorithmic chemistry.” [SEP] Naturally, and most naturally in Santa Fe, where one can be healed by means known nowhere else in the universe, Walter nicknamed algorithmic chemistry “Alchemy.” [SEP] Unlike the alchemy of Newton’s time, Walter’s works. [SEP] Here is alchemy: Walter borrowed a computer language known as “lisp.” [SEP] Lisp expressions can operate on one another. [SEP] So expression 1 encounters 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
What had Walter found? [SEP] The first thing he found were “copiers,” that is, lisp expressions that could copy any lisp expression, including themselves. [SEP] Once such replicators emerged, they took over Walter’s steaming pot of lisp expressions. [SEP] Indeed, such a lisp expression is rather like Jack Szostak’s hoped-for RNA polymerase, able to copy any RNA sequence, including itself. [SEP] Walter called such copiers “type-1” organizations. [SEP] Could other self-reproducing organizations emerge? [SEP] Walter “cheated” and simply disallowed copier replicators to occur. [SEP] Bereft of copiers, Walter’s soup ripped forward again. [SEP] Again novel lisp expressions	came	forth in profusion. [SEP] Again, after a while, a recurrent set of lisp expressions emerged. [SEP] What had Walter found? [SEP] He found collectively autocatalytic sets of lisp expressions, essentially identical to my collectively autocatalytic sets of polymers. [SEP] Walter called these “type-2” organizations. [SEP] In each such collectively autocatalytic lisp set, each expression is formed by the action of some lisp expression on some lisp expression in the set. [SEP] The set as a whole is collectively reproducing.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
One contentious issue leads us to another. [SEP] And now I hope to trouble you deeply. [SEP] Tomasina was but one of many lineages of creatures evolving much as Darwin taught us, by heritable variation and natural selection. [SEP] Let’s turn to a Darwinian account of the function of the heart. [SEP] Roughly, Darwin would say, the function of the heart is to pump blood. [SEP] Namely, Darwin would say, this causal consequence of the heart is the virtue for which it was, and persistently is, selected by natural selection. [SEP] I tend to think Darwin’s account of the heart is correct. [SEP] Notice that the form of the account is ontological. [SEP] Hearts	came	into existence, somehow, and are sustained because it is advantageous to organisms to have a means to pump blood. [SEP] But the heart has other causal consequences. [SEP] For example, the heart makes heart sounds as its valves open and close. [SEP] Presumably, heart sounds are not the causal consequences of the heart upon which natural selection has acted. [SEP] Heart sounds are not the function of the heart.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
 And every bacterium whose molecules wiggle in a useful way that turn out to detect a source of energy or danger or opportunity in some novel fashion tends to be selected for that novel functionality. [SEP] Look at the rate of emergence of bacteria resistant to our antibiotics and the myriad unexpected ways such resistance arises at the molecular level. [SEP] Who could have foretold the ways? [SEP] The example of the common emergence of Darwinian preadaptations in the biosphere may point to an interesting connection with the diYculty Fontana and others have had achieving the persistent emergence of more complexity in algorithmic models such as alchemy and Tierra. [SEP] Gertrude did fly, and thereby the capacity of her folds of skin to function as wings were selected. [SEP] Flying squirrels	came	to exist in the universe. [SEP] Restated, a property of Gertrude = indeed, here a collective property of her atomic constituents = made itself manifest in the real physical world in a context that lent survival advantage to Gertrude. [SEP] Were we to have a formal algorithmic description of a formal simulated algorithmic Gertrude that did not have as an algorithmic consequence that her skin flaps might function as wings, then the emergence of the higher-order category of “winged squirrel” could not be derived algorithmically. [SEP] Similarly, were we to have a formal description of an engine block that did not include its rigidity, we could not algorithmically derive that the engine block could be used as a chassis.

m and extinction of old species. [SEP] In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. [SEP] We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. [SEP] We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. [SEP] And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera. [SEP] But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. [SEP] Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. [SEP] With the horse went the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. [SEP] With the car	came	paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. [SEP] The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. [SEP] One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. [SEP] More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? [SEP] Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. [SEP] Most firms die young, some last a long time. [SEP] We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions.

[SEP] I’m deeply glad to be chairman of the board and chief scientist of Bios, to be working with a very creative group of colleagues, and to be finding routes in the practical world where our ideas do, in fact, apply. [SEP] I mention Bios and my involvement because some of the science we have done bears on diverse aspects of practical economics and even begins to suggest pathways beyond the limitations of the Arrow-Debreu theory. [SEP] I begin with Boeing, which	came	to Bios wondering how to design and build airplanes in a year rather than seven years. [SEP] Out of what modular parts and processes, wonder Boeing folks, might it be possible to assemble a family of related aircraft for a diversity of markets? [SEP] The obvious approach was to invent “Lego World.” [SEP] As founding general partner and chief scientist, I duly authorized the expenditure of $. [SEP] to buy a largish box of Lego parts.

onspontaneous processes, the universe as a whole advances autocatalytically into its adjacent possible, driven by the very increase of diversity by which novel displacements from equilibrium come into existence, are detected, are coupled to, and come to drive the endergonic creation of novel kinds of molecules and other entities. [SEP] Economic growth is part and parcel of the creativity of the universe as a whole. [SEP] Think of the Wright brothers’ airplane. [SEP] It was a recombination between an airfoil, a light gasoline engine, bicycle wheels, and a propeller. [SEP] The more objects an economy has, the more novel objects can be constructed. [SEP] When we were working with rough stone in the Lower Paleolithic, we pretty much mastered everything that could be done until pressure flaking	came	along. [SEP] Most forms of simple stone tools that could be made were made. [SEP] Today, the adjacent possible of goods and services is so vast that the economy, stumbling and lunging into the future adjacent possible, will only construct an ever smaller subset of the technologically possible. [SEP] The economy is ever more historically contingent   .    [SEP] .   . As the biosphere is ever more historically contingent   .   .   . As, I suspect, the universe is ever more historically contingent.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
In turn, this led me to think about and discuss natural games, or ways of making a living. [SEP] Since ways of making a living evolve with the organisms making those livings, we got to the winning games are the games the winners play. [SEP] Which led me to suggest that those ways of making a living that are well searched out and exploited by the search mechanisms organisms happen to use  mutation, recombination, and selection  will be ways of making a living that are well populated by organisms and similar species. [SEP] Ways of making a living that cannot be well searched out by organisms and their mutation recombination search procedures will not be well populated. [SEP] So we	came	to the reasonable conclusion that a biosphere of autonomous agents is a self-consistently self-constructing whole, in which agents, ways of making a living, and ways of searching for how to make a living all work together to coconstruct the biosphere. [SEP] Happily, we are picking the problems we can manage to solve. [SEP] Of course, if we could not solve our chosen ways to make livings, we would be dead. [SEP] And there is, I think, a molecular clue that the biosphere is persistently coconstructing itself in the survivable regime for a propagating set of lineages. [SEP] We have just characterized the survivable percolating web regime where the fitness landscape of each creature deforms due to the adaptive moves of other creatures, but there are always neighboring ways of surviving.

[SEP] One of the last great Italian Gothic buildings was Milan Cathedral, begun in 1385.

o the United States from South Africa, Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses, which led to an unusual commission: the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse. [SEP] He gave the commercial building in Manchester, Connecticut, a new façade dominated by a large arch, over-scaled voussoirs, and a pediment. [SEP] Inside, the barrel-vaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order. [SEP] Greenberg had graduated from Yale in 1965, and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism. [SEP] However, unlike Venturi and Moore, Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building; he was returning to Classical roots. [SEP] From this modest beginning, over the next two decades,	came	a variety of commissions: a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building, several college and university buildings, and a Roman Catholic church. [SEP] His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens, Georgia, a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills. [SEP] Greenberg is also known for large country houses, both in the United States and in Europe. [SEP] Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope, he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential work—using Georgian and American Colonial styles.

[SEP] The odd shapes and unorthodox materials marked Gehry as a maverick. [SEP] That was in 1978. [SEP] Unexpectedly, he attracted a broad range of commissions, not only residential clients, but also museums, public institutions, universities, corporations, and developers, and not only in the United States but around the world.

The controller responded, seconds later: "Somebody call Cleveland?"This was followed by a second radio transmission, with sounds of screaming. [SEP] The Cleveland Center controllers began to try to identify the possible source of the transmissions, and noticed that United 93 had descended some 700 feet. [SEP] The controller attempted again to raise United 93 several times, with no response. [SEP] At 9:30, the controller began to poll the other flights on his frequency to determine if they had heard the screaming; several said they had. [SEP] At 9:32, a third radio transmission	came	over the frequency:"Keep remaining sitting. We have a bomb on board." [SEP] The controller understood, but chose to respond: "Calling Cleveland Center, you're unreadable. Say again, slowly." [SEP] He notified his supervisor, who passed the notice up the chain of command. [SEP] By 9:34, word of the hijacking had reached FAA headquarters. [SEP] FAA headquarters had by this time established an open line of communication with the Command Center at Herndon and instructed it to poll all its centers about suspect aircraft. [SEP] The Command Center executed the request and, a minute later, Cleveland Center reported that "United 93 may have a bomb on board." [SEP] At 9:34, the Command Center relayed the information concerning United 93 to FAA headquarters.

EP] And none of the information conveyed in the White House video teleconference, at least in the first hour, was being passed to the NMCC. [SEP] As one witness recalled, "[It] was almost like there were parallel decisionmaking processes going on; one was a voice conference orchestrated by the NMCC . . . and then there was the [White House video teleconference]. . . . [I]n my mind they were competing venues for command and control and decisionmaking." [SEP] At 10:03, the conference received reports of more missing aircraft, "2 possibly 3 aloft," and learned of a combat air patrol over Washington. [SEP] There was discussion of the need for rules of engagement. [SEP] Clarke reported that they were asking the President for authority to shoot down aircraft. [SEP] Confirmation of that authority	came	at 10:25, but the commands were already being conveyed in more direct contacts with the Pentagon. [SEP] The Pentagon Teleconferences. [SEP] Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director for operations immediately thought the second strike was a terrorist attack. [SEP] The job of the NMCC in such an emergency is to gather the relevant parties and establish the chain of command between the National Command Authority-the president and the secretary of defense- and those who need to carry out their orders.	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3

At that point in time, the Langley pilots did not know the threat they were facing, did not know where United 93 was located, and did not have shootdown authorization. [SEP] First, the Langley pilots were never briefed about the reason they were scrambled. [SEP] As the lead pilot explained, "I reverted to the Russian threat. . . . I'm thinking cruise missile threat from the sea. You know you look down and see the Pentagon burning and I thought the bastards snuck one by us. . . . [Y]ou couldn't see any airplanes, and no one told us anything." [SEP] The pilots knew their mission was to divert aircraft, but did not know that the threat	came	from hijacked airliners. [SEP] Second, NEADS did not have accurate information on the location of United 93. [SEP] Presumably FAA would have provided such information, but we do not know how long that would have taken, nor how long it would have taken NEADS to locate the target.	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. [SEP] Today the town, known as Silves, (see page 38) is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts. [SEP] The long struggle by Christians to expel the Moors (a campaign known as the Reconquista, or Reconquest) began towards the end of the eighth century a.d. By the 11th century, Portucale consisted of a small section of Castile and León (today’s northern Portugal). [SEP] Yet it wasn’t until the 12th century that significant gains were made to take back southern Iberia. [SEP] The beginning of the end	came	in the Battle of Ourique in 1139. [SEP] After the victory, Count Afonso Henriques proclaimed himself the first king of Portugal, making it one of the first nation-states in Europe. [SEP] The Reconquest of Silves, not achieved for another 50 years, was a grisly affair. [SEP] A mixed bag of Crusaders from northern Europe were recruited en route to their battles east in the Holy Land. [SEP] They sailed upon the river port of Silves and, ignoring conditional offers of surrender, slew all the inhabitants (at no small loss to themselves) and pillaged the great treasures of the city.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
The beginning of the 19th century brought further alarm to the country. [SEP] This time the epicenter was Paris, and the cause Napoleon. [SEP] Just as Portugal’s forced alliance with Spain had made the country a target for Drake’s 16th-century raids, now her friendly alliance with England rankled Napoleon. [SEP] In 1807 the French invaded Lisbon, causing the royal family to flee to Brazil. [SEP] Spain, followed by Portugal, rose up against the French occupation, in what	came	to be known as the Peninsular War. [SEP] Among the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olhão (see page 57). [SEP] On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. [SEP] It’s said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. [SEP] The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] In the 15th and 16th centuries, they ushered in an Age of Discovery, rounding Africa’s Cape of Good Hope and eventually reaching India and the Pacific. [SEP] Others found their way to the Americas and Brazil. [SEP] Opening world trade routes across the globe, they established Portugal as a maritime superpower. [SEP] Spices, gold, and diamonds flowed across the seas to Lisbon. [SEP] Portugal soon lapsed into decline, though, tattered by wars and constitutional crises, and for two centuries or more the Algarve remained isolated from the rest of Europe. [SEP] Even though the coast received many illustrious visitors from Roman times through the Middle Ages and up to the Edwardian period (when travelers	came	to luxuriate in Monchique’s spa waters), the Algarve’s elite vacation status is a relatively recent phenomenon. [SEP] The first resort on the coast, Praia da Rocha, was only “discovered” in the 1930s, and the real build-up didn’t kick into overdrive until the beginning of the 1980s. [SEP] Spain’s Costa del Sol developed earlier and more rapidly (and some would say, more disastrously). [SEP] Yet the lessons of rampant, ill-advised development across the border were not heeded. [SEP] Only recently has environmental and aesthetic consciousness at least mandated that newer developments be limited to low-rises.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-Intro.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
Religious Strife Amsterdam was already developing a reputation of tolerance as these new and disparate groups settled into the city. [SEP] At the same time, Martin Luther’s new Christian doctrine, Protestantism, was spreading like wildfire across Europe. [SEP] It took a firm foothold in the northern provinces of the Low Countries — with Amsterdam at its heart. [SEP] It was at this time that Huguenots (French Protestants)	came	to Amsterdam to flee persecution in their own country. [SEP] To counter Protestantism the Catholic Spanish instigated the vicious and cruel force of Inquisition. [SEP] In 1535 there were anti-papacy demonstrations in Dam Square and in 1550 an Edict of Blood was issued by the Spanish to hunt out the heretics. [SEP] Thus began 80 years of civil strife in Amsterdam and the region of Holland.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
, and 18th centuries, the reflections of its illustrious history happily ripple on into the 21st century. [SEP] However, the lure of Amsterdam’s bricks and mortar is only part of its excitement. [SEP] Its contemporary culture is vibrant — it’s definitely not a city stuck in the past, and the people are open-minded, easygoing, and opinionated but also down to earth and welcoming to visitors. [SEP] Amsterdam is situated in the north of The Netherlands and was set where the outlet of the Amstel River meets the salty tidal waters of the Zuider Zee. [SEP] With little dry land to build on, exactly why a small group of settlers chose this unpromising spot is difficult to understand. [SEP] Yet it proved to be an excellent decision because Amsterdammers (as the natives of Amsterdam are called) soon	came	to control the waters of the river, and the trade which flowed along it. [SEP] By the 17th century, Amsterdam had become arguably the richest city in the world, at the center of a huge Dutch colonial empire. [SEP] It traded in spices, rum, and sugar cane among other commodities, and its residents demanded only the best. [SEP] The Amsterdam of this period — called the Golden Age — forms the heart of today’s city. [SEP] Without doubt, the initial lure of the city is its numerous historic buildings. [SEP] The lines of tall, narrow houses with their pretty gables rest beside picture-perfect tree-lined canals. [SEP] They are connected by ornate iron bridges and cobbled walkways, which have changed little for over 300 years, in fact, since they felt the footfall of such inhabitants as the artist 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-Intro.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
In the early 19th century the weigh house closed and Waag had a number of less illustrious tenants; it even spent some time as a furniture store. [SEP] It now houses a café/bar, so you can have a refreshment and admire the impressive Gothic interior at the same time. [SEP] Nieuwmarkt (New Market) surrounds the Waag and it is home to several different types of market throughout the week. [SEP] If you walk to the north side of the Waag and look up the Gelderskade you will see a tower dominating the skyline. [SEP] This is Schreierstoren, also part of the new city wall of 1480. [SEP] City scholars are divided as to the reason for the tower’s name. [SEP] Some say it comes from the word schreien which means “weeping” as it was a place where sailors’ weeping wives	came	to wave their men off to sea. [SEP] Other say that the name is a derivation of scherpe, which means “sharp” — denoting the towers position on a 90-degree bend in the wall. [SEP] From Waag walk down Sint Antoniesbreestraat, past modern apartment blocks built for the workers of the city in the 1970s. [SEP] On your right you will see the ornate tower of Zuiderkerk (South Church). [SEP] This church was the first place of worship to be built following the Reformation and was begun in 1603. [SEP] Designed by Hendrick de Keyser, its lines were much admired by Sir Christopher Wren, architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. [SEP] It was de-consecrated in 1929 and is now a community information center.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] This part of town is still mostly residential and many houses have been converted into apartments for successful Amsterdammers. [SEP] It is fascinating to peek inside at the ultra-modern interiors, which give a feel of the flair the Dutch seem to have for interior design. [SEP] At number 605 Herengracht, Museum Willet-Holthuysen gives you the opportunity to look behind the façade of a genuine Golden Age house. [SEP] It was completed in 1690 and structurally has been altered very little since that time, although it has been changed cosmetically several times as fashions changed. [SEP] In 1855 it	came	into the possession of the Holthuysen family. [SEP] Pieter Holthuysen was a successful trader in glass and English coal (which goes to prove that you didn’t need to trade in exotic goods to become wealthy). [SEP] After the death of Pieter and his wife, the house is bequeathed to their daughter Louisa who later married Abraham Willet. [SEP] He had a love of art and was a founding member of the Royal Antiquarian Society — a society whose aim was to promote national art and history. [SEP] On her death in 1895 Louisa bequeathed the house and its contents to the city of Amsterdam on condition that it would be opened as a museum. [SEP] This it duly did in 1896.

aside in 1346 for the benefit of Beguines, members of a lay Catholic sisterhood. [SEP] They lived simple lives and in return for their lodgings undertook to care for the sick and educate the poor. [SEP] Although nothing remains of the 14th-century houses, number 34 is Het Houten Huis, Amsterdam’s oldest house, dating from 1488. [SEP] The Catholic chapel dates from 1680 when it was built in a style to disguise its purpose. [SEP] The stained glass windows depict the Miracle of Amsterdam. [SEP] However, in the center of the courtyard is an earlier church now called the English Presbyterian Church. [SEP] It was rented out to English and Scottish worshippers in 1607 following the Alteration, and the Pilgrim Fathers worshipped here before they set off on their long journey to the New World (they	came	to Amsterdam from England before they set sail for the New World). [SEP] The last Beguine died as recently as 1971 and today, although the houses are still offered only to single women of the Christian faith, the women are not expected to undertake lay work.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] Built as housing for workers and artisans in the early 17th century it extends roughly from the far bank of Prinsengracht to Lijnbaansgracht, and from Brouwersgracht (Brewers Canal) in the north down to Leidseplein. [SEP] Many of the streets were named after fragrant flowers but this was not the prettiest or sweetest smelling area of Amsterdam in its heyday. [SEP] Overcrowding was rife, and with industries such as fabric-dyeing carried out on the ground floors, it was an unsanitary place to live. [SEP] Its name is said to derive from the French word jardin since a large contingent of French Huguenots	came	to live here to escape political persecution in their homeland. [SEP] Today, the Jordaan has been revived and it has become a fashionable residential area. [SEP] You’ll find many bars, restaurants, and interesting boutiques in the area.

In ancient Greek mythology Athens is named following a contest between Athena, goddess of wisdom, and Poseidon, god of the sea. [SEP] Both had their eye on the prize real estate, so it was agreed that whoever could come up with the more useful gift for mortals would win. [SEP] The half-human, half-serpent king of Athens, Cecrops, acted as arbiter. [SEP] First	came	Poseidon, who struck the rock of the Acropolis with his mighty trident and brought salt water gushing forth. [SEP] Then it was Athena’s turn. [SEP] As she struck the rock an olive tree appeared, which proved more useful and valuable. [SEP] Thus she acquired the position of the city’s special protector. [SEP] The actual history of the city-state of Athens is just as fascinating as its mythology. [SEP] From around 2000 b.c. wandering bands filtered into Greece from Asia Minor. [SEP] Known as Achaeans, they were the first Greek-speaking people in the area, and over the centuries they built many imposing fortresses and developed the rich Mycenaean civilization, based in the Peloponnese.

It be	came	Athens’ enemy when it sided with the Spartans during the devastating wars of the fourth century b.c. but the city recovered quickly from the defeat and had a second period of influence that began during the third century b.c. when Philip of Macedonia made it the capital of the Corinthian League.

The Spaniards never bothered to settle in the Bahamas, but the number of shipwrecks attest that their galleons frequently passed through the archipelago en route to and from the Caribbean, Florida, Bermuda, and their home ports. [SEP] On Eleuthera the explorers dug a fresh-water well — at a spot now known as “Spanish Wells” — which was used to replenish the supplies of water on their ships before they began the long journey back to Europe with their cargoes of South American gold. [SEP] As for the Lucayans, within 25 years all of them, perhaps some 30,000 people, were removed from the Bahamas to work — and die — in Spanish gold mines and on farms and pearl fisheries on Hispaniola (Haiti), Cuba, and elsewhere in the Caribbean. [SEP] English sea captains also	came	to know the beautiful but deserted Bahamian islands during the 17th century.

As the colonies’ war effort picked up steam, both France and Spain weighed in against the British. [SEP] In May 1782, New Providence surrendered to a large Spanish-American invasion fleet from Cuba and for the next year a Spanish governor ruled the Bahamas. [SEP] News traveled slowly in those days. [SEP] The Treaty of Versailles in 1783 formally restored the Bahamas to the British, but actual liberation	came	through a famous escapade that would never have happened in the age of the telegraph. [SEP] Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Deveaux, a loyalist from South Carolina, sailed from Florida with six ships, picked up men and fishing boats at Harbour Island and Eleuthera, and “invaded” Nassau. [SEP] Though vastly outnumbered and outgunned, Deveaux employed elaborate ruses with his little boats to convince the Spanish defenders that his force was overpowering. [SEP] The humiliating Spanish surrender is proudly recalled in Bahamian history, even though it was all unnecessary: the peace treaty had been signed the previous week.

[SEP] In some respects, World War II put the Bahamas on the international map. [SEP] The colony was chosen to have two of the sites Britain leased to the United States under Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “destroyers for bases” deal in 1940.

The Bahamas islands are the flattened peaks of a huge ancient mountain range that once towered many thousands of feet into the sky. [SEP] They now lie low in the water, the highest point — Mount Alvernia on Cat Island — being only 206 ft (65 m) above sea level. [SEP] The eastern coastlines of the islands break the long tidal fetch that travels across the Atlantic; on the sheltered western coastline, coral outcrops have produced vast shallow sand banks that reflect waters of myriad translucent blues and greens. [SEP] Indeed, it was these characteristic shallow banks that gave the Bahamas islands their name. [SEP] When Spanish explorers	came	to map the area in the 16th century, they named the area baja mar, or shallow seas, as a warning to the galleons that would be sailing through the waters. [SEP] The name was later anglicized and the Bahamas were born. [SEP] The warning on Spanish maps unfortunately did little to stop ships from running aground or foundering on the treacherous shoals; even today treasure lost centuries ago is still being discovered and salvaged.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-Intro.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] Ernest Hemingway spent a lot of time fishing and writing here — photographs of this prominent visitor still adorn the walls of the Compleat Angler Hotel, where he wrote To Have and Have Not. [SEP] American politician Adam Clayton Powell, who was regularly seen at the marina of Alice Town, the major settlement, helped raise the profile of the place in the eyes of Americans. [SEP] The islands flourished during the years of American Prohibition, when many	came	here to enjoy a shot or two of hard liquor. [SEP] Alice Town with its bars and hotels is still the center of the action. [SEP] A series of fishing competitions make up a “season” for the rich, bright, and beautiful, who descend to fish during the day and enjoy the lively social scene after dark.

A Brief History Today’s Indonesians mainly descend from people who	came	from south China via the Malay peninsula and moved along the island chain to Java, Bali, Lombok, and beyond, from 3000 to 1000 [SEP] b.c.

[SEP] Trade and cultural exchanges with Southeast Asia had certainly begun by that period, and there were frequent contacts with India by [SEP] a.d.  [SEP] 100. [SEP] About this time, too, wet rice cultivation was introduced to Bali, changing the face of the countryside to its present appearance of rice paddy fields and terraces.

is flowering was short-lived. [SEP] With the death in 1389 of King Hayam Wurukin, its last great ruler, the empire of Majapahit began to decline. [SEP] Muslim traders and teachers had already started converting several of Java’s princes and people to Islam, especially in coastal areas, and in the 14th and 15th centuries the movement spread to the interior. [SEP] By the year 1500, seeing their world breaking up, many Majapahit aristocrats, priests, and scholars fled to Bali, where their culture continued to flourish. [SEP] Islam never gained a strong foothold in Bali, which was difficult to invade because of its many reefs and lack of harbors, and had few products to attract traders. [SEP] The early 16th century also brought the first European ships to Indonesian waters, when the Portuguese	came	in search of spices and set up trading posts — though not on Bali. [SEP] In 1550 Bali was united under Batu Renggong, the formidable ruler known as Dewa Agung (god-king) of Gelgel, near Klungkung. [SEP] His men even succeeded in turning back the tide of Islam for a short while, adding eastern Java and Lombok to his domains. [SEP] During his rule, Balinese power, culture, and influence reached a peak, with a boom in temple building and the associated crafts of sculpture and woodcarving.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] They found the place almost deserted, until suddenly the Raja of Badung, together with his family and hundreds of courtiers, emerged from the palace. [SEP] On a signal from the raja, one of his priests stabbed him with a kris (knife), and then, pausing only to stab their children first, the rest of the royal party began a puputan, either killing themselves or running suicidally towards the enemy. [SEP] When the dreadful scene was repeated by the Dewa Agung and his wives and followers in 1908 in front of the palace at Klungkung, the rajas’ resistance to Dutch rule was at an end. [SEP] The public in the Netherlands was appalled by these grisly events. [SEP] From then on, Bali and the Balinese	came	to be looked on as unique — to be protected from the colonial treatment that had turned the other islands into plantations exploited for profit. [SEP] Tourism was discouraged, although a few foreigners did make the journey and returned to the outside world with news of the island’s extraordinary culture. [SEP] An American couple, Bob and Louise Koke, opened the first hotel on Kuta Beach in 1936; Louise G. Koke’s memoir, Our Hotel In Bali, provides an idyllic portrait of Bali’s first, tenuous endeavor at tourism from 1936 until the Japanese invasion in 1942. [SEP] During the 1920s and 1930s, Cokorde Gde Agung Sukawati, ruler of Ubud, extended a long Sukawati family tradition of patronizing talent and craftsmanship by hosting visiting Western artists, including the German painter, Walter Spie	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
Just inland, parallel to the beach, the town of Sanur looks at first like nothing more than a long strip of souvenir shops, clothing boutiques, and restaurants. [SEP] But take a walk along some of the lanes leading off the main road, Jalan Tanjung Sari, or beyond the impatient traffic of the bypass (Jalan Bypass) and you’ll find traditional life still going on as if tourism had never happened. [SEP] Many small Indonesian and seafood restaurants on the street are pleasant; one or two are outstanding. [SEP] Sanur hotels provide the best top-bracket dining. [SEP] Only a short walk north along the shore from the ten-story Grand Bali Beach Hotel is the Le Mayeur Museum, once the house of the Belgian painter, Adrien Jean Le Mayeur. [SEP] He	came	to Bali in 1932 and stayed to marry the beautiful Ni Pollok, who had been a well-known legong dancer (see page 88) before retiring (at 14!) to teach dance. [SEP] In its day, the garden with its ponds and statues was open on the seaward side; now it is fully enclosed. [SEP] The outside of the house is covered with stone carvings while the interior is a gallery of sculpture collected by Le Mayeur. [SEP] The walls are hung with his own paintings: European landscapes, Balinese scenes, and studies of dancers, including Ni Pollok. [SEP] When Le Mayeur died in 1958, the house was turned into a museum that his widow ran until her death in 1985. [SEP] Near the small harbor at this end of Sanur Beach you can find motorized prahu (outrigger boats) to take you to Nusa Lembongan, an island 17 km (11 mil	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
At the western end of town, an old suspension bridge and a new road bridge cross the Campuhan river. [SEP] On the north side of the ravine is the temple of Pura Gunung Labah, which may date from the 8th century a.d., possibly making it one of Bali’s earliest. [SEP] Shrouded in dense vegetation, it overlooks Goa Raksasa, a cave named after the evil giant who is said to have dwelt there. [SEP] Just north of the Campuhan bridges, the Tjampuhan Hotel (the same place-name but with the old spelling) stands where Walter Spies (see page 53)	came	to live in the 1930s. [SEP] Across the road and up the hill, stone stairs lead to rice paddies and the track to the home of the Young Artists group at Penestanan. [SEP] At neighboring Sayan, Westerners have built their homes overlooking the rice terraces and spectacular Ayung gorge. [SEP] The road from Campuhan past the Museum Neka leads to the town of Kedewatan, where the most luxurious hotels in the area compete to offer similarly stunning views into the Ayung valley. [SEP] Beyond Payangan, the little-used road wends its way through scenic countryside all the way to Batur (see page 59).	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3

In 1640, with Spain and France at war, Catalonia declared itself an independent republic, allied to Philip IV’s enemy France. [SEP] After the French defeat in 1652, the Catalan territories north of the Pyrenees were delivered to France, fixing the border where it is today. [SEP] The ensuing years were rife with constant wars, shifting alliances, and disputes over succession to the crown. [SEP] In all of these conflicts, Barcelona automatically sided with whomever opposed Madrid, and usually ended up the loser. [SEP] The worst of these episodes	came	in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1713) between the backers of Philip of Anjou, the 17-year-old grandson of Louis XIV of France, and the Hapsburg claimant, Archduke Charles of Austria.

[SEP] Just beyond the hotel on the carrer Nou de la Rambla, 3, is Palau Güell, the mansion Gaudí (see page 50) built in 1885 for his principal patron, the textile tycoon Count Eusebi Güell. [SEP] This meticulously detailed, fortress-like home, a study in high Gothic, is now open for guided tours. [SEP] Visitors get to see the fabulously tiled rooftop chimneys, which were hidden from view for decades. [SEP] Returning to the Ramblas, cross over and follow the short passage that leads into the arcaded Plaça Reial. [SEP] This handsome and spacious square is graced with a fountain, palm trees, and wrought-iron lamp-posts designed by the young Gaudí. [SEP] Like the Boquería, the Hotel Oriente, and other Rambla landmarks, this square	came	into being as a result of the destruction of a convent, when church properties were expropriated in an anti-clerical period in the mid-19th century. [SEP] Not long ago it was the stomping grounds of junkies and petty thieves, but it has been since revitalized and is flush with bars, cafés, and restaurants. [SEP] The final promenade leading down to the harbor is the short Rambla de Santa Mònica, beginning at the Plaça del Teatre, site of the run-down Teatre Principal. [SEP] Though the Centre d’Art Santa Mònica puts on fine contemporary art exhibits, the area continues to be the beat of prostitutes and cops, pickpockets, and bag-snatchers.

For all of Barcelona’s exuberant architecture, the city’s modern district is a model of rationalist urban planning, a rigid geometric grid dryly called “the Extension.” [SEP] The outrageous and conservative, one learns, coexist here without much fuss. [SEP] Barcelona’s expansion	came	about in a remarkable burst of urban development. [SEP] By the mid-1800s Barcelona was bursting at the seams and suffocating inside its ring of medieval walls. [SEP] A municipal competition was held in 1859 to select a plan for a new quarter between the old city and the Collserola hills. [SEP] The job went to a road engineer named Ildefons Cerdà, whose plan quintupled the city’s size in a matter of decades.

Montjuïc was the natural site for the 1992 Olympic Ring (Anella Olímpica) of athletic facilities. [SEP] For many years its 210-meter (689-foot) summit, panoramic view of the city and harbor, and outstanding complex of museums, amusement attractions, and sports facilities have made the hill a favorite place to spend an afternoon. [SEP] Montjuïc	came	into its own as the site of Barcelona’s 1929 International Exhibition. [SEP] The Plaça d’Espanya’s ornate fountain was created to grace the entrance to the fairground and is still a good point to begin a visit to Montjuïc, as it has a metro and bus stop. [SEP] A number of hangar-type halls used during the year by commercial exhibitors at fairs line a central pedestrian avenue leading upwards to the vast Palau Nacional, the fair’s Spanish pavilion. [SEP] This domed palace holds one of the world’s finest collections of medieval art, the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya. [SEP] Unmatched for Romanesque art and Gothic painting of the Catalan school, it has undergone extensive refurbishment over recent years, and the section on Romanesque art is now finally reopened.

The German capital be	came	a municipality during the 1200s, ironically as a divided city. [SEP] In those days the two rival halves were in no rush to unite. [SEP] The fishermen of Cölln, whose name survives in the modern borough of Neukölln, lived on an island in the River Spree. [SEP] The townships that comprise the modern Mitte district grew up around market places over which the people’s churches, the Nikolaikirche and Marienkirche, still tower today. [SEP] With the fortress of Burg Köpenick providing a common defense to the south, Cölln and Berlin formed a trade center between Magdeburg and Poznan.

In the autumn of 1938, Hitler was put out that Berliners did not share his enthusiasm for the cavalcade of troops driving through the city. [SEP] The army was preparing its march into what used to be Czechoslovakia, but onlookers shared none of the fervor that had greeted military parades in 1914. [SEP] Their disquiet was shortly to be justified by the hail of bombs on the capital. [SEP] The first attacks	came	in 1940 from the British in retaliation for the air raids on London. [SEP] Attacks were stepped up after the German defeat at Stalingrad in 1943, with Anglo-American “carpet-bombing.” [SEP] The worst single raid was on 6 February 1945, when bombs wiped out 4 sq km (1 1⁄2 sq miles) of the city center in one hour. [SEP] Hitler spent the last days of the war in his bunker at the Reich chancellery.

The erection of the Wall did significantly reduce the flow of refugees to a few isolated escapes, but the East German economy suffered even more from the assaults of massive mismanagement and high-level corruption. [SEP] Erich Honecker’s regime won international diplomatic recognition for East Berlin as its capital and, with gleaming hotels and skyscrapers, tried to give it a lustre to rival West Berlin. [SEP] Beneath the surface, however, the drabness of daily life and lack of personal freedom continued to undermine any chance of popular support. [SEP] The final push which led to the collapse of the Berlin Wall	came	when an ecological campaign in Leipzig against nuclear weapons and industrial pollution grew into nationwide pressure for democratic freedom. [SEP] In 1989, with thousands of East Germans fleeing to the West via Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, the country was swept up in the wave of eastern European revolutions unleashed by the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. [SEP] His visit to East Berlin in October 1989 for the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic left it clear that Soviet troops would no longer shore up its regime. [SEP] The Berlin Wall was opened on 9 November 1989, and at midnight on 3 October 1990, a huge black, red, and gold national flag was hoisted at the Reichstag.

The gate itself, designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, was built between 1789 and 1791.

[SEP] (To go all the way, Hitler had even planned to hoist the gate onto an artificial hill, in an attempt to create a mini-Acropolis.) [SEP] Forming part of the city wall, the gate was intended by the more pragmatic Prussians not so much as a triumphal arch as an imposing tollgate for collecting duties.

Isolated from London by more than 5,300 km (3,300 miles) in an age of slow communications, Bermuda sometimes found itself out of step with developments in the homeland. [SEP] In 1649, the islanders were appalled to learn of the execution of Charles I and the proclamation of Cromwell’s Commonwealth. [SEP] They later rejoiced when Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660. [SEP] Another era ended in 1684 when the Bermuda Company lost its charter. [SEP] After a five-year legal battle, Bermuda be	came	a British colony with a degree of self-government.

Returning to Ferry Point junction, take the north fork to St. George’s town. [SEP] You’ll travel around the far side of Mullet Bay — a sheltered natural harbor for small craft — and then past a children’s play area before reaching the outskirts of town. [SEP] (St. George’s can be reached via bus routes [SEP]1, [SEP]3, [SEP]10, and [SEP]11.) [SEP] Set in the far northeast portion of Bermuda, St. George’s is the island’s oldest town and the historic heartland of the colony. [SEP] Sir George Somers and his brave band of settlers were heading for Virginia in 1609 when they were shipwrecked on reefs just offshore from here. [SEP] They were surprised by the natural riches that Bermuda had to offer, as the island had good cedar wood to build more ships. [SEP] Out of adversity	came	good fortune, and the settlers soon built two new ships and sailed from Bermuda to complete their original goal of reaching Jamestown. [SEP] Somers returned to Bermuda the following year but died here before he could develop the town further. [SEP] The settlers who founded the town in 1615 created a basic grid pattern that has remained unchanged. [SEP] The lanes in town are wide enough for a horse and carriage, but no wider. [SEP] They retain their original names, some with reference to local characters and activities such as Printer’s Alley and Aunt Peggy’s Lane.

[SEP] On your right, watch for Tucker House Museum, which was from 1775 the home of Henry Tucker, the President of the Governor’s Council. [SEP] The Tuckers were one of the most influential families on Bermuda, the first family member having arrived on the island in 1616. [SEP] In 1950, a descendant — an American named Robert Tucker — bequeathed many family heirlooms to the house in his will.

At School and Washington streets, the lovely red-brick building with a Dutch gambrel roof was built in 1718 as an apothecary shop on the site of Anne Hutchinson’s residence.

Early Settlers The settlement of present-day Hungary goes far back in time.

[SEP] The ﬁrst tribes that	came	to this area brought skills and tools which improved the lot of the hunter, made farming feasible, and, in time, gave rise to primitive industries. [SEP] Around the third century b.c., Hungary was occupied by a Celtic-Illyrian tribe known as Eraviscans, refugees from wars in Greece.

The Angevin Dynasty The Arpád dynasty ended in 1301; the French House of Angevin (Anjou), in the shape of Károly (Charles) Róbert, claimed the crown.

[SEP] Two more foreign kings ruled after Róbert, but it was a Hungarian noble, János Hunyadi, who was to become the national saviour in the mid-15th century.

[SEP] The neighbouring Austrian Habsburg rulers, fearful that Vienna would be the Ottoman empire’s next conquest, proclaimed themselves rulers of Hungary, thus creating a buffer zone between themselves and the Turks.

Hitler’s Germany, meanwhile, provided investment in Hungarian industry and a market for Hungarian farm produce, and earned a grudging admiration from the Hungarians for its deﬁance of the World War I allies. [SEP] In 1940 Hungary allowed the German army to cross its territory and, as a reward, they temporarily recovered parts of its former lands from Romania and Yugoslavia. [SEP] It was a false dawn before the country’s blackest hours. [SEP] Thousands of Hungarians died supporting the Germans on the Russian Front, and just as Horthy thought he could squirm out of Hitler’s grasp by declaring neutrality in 1944, the country was occupied by the Germans. [SEP] As the Soviet army moved closer to Budapest in late 1944 and the bombing of the city be	came	more intense, Horthy played his last card by declaring an armistice.

This takes some of the wind out of the sails of John Cabot, the Venetian navigator who claimed Canada’s eastern seaboard for England’s Henry VII in 1497. [SEP] Locals fight over whether it was Nova Scotia or Newfoundland he actually discovered. [SEP] Cabot himself mistook it for the northeast coast of Asia. [SEP] In fact, Breton, Basque, and Portuguese fishermen had been here long before him but kept to themselves the secret of the coastal waters’ teeming cod fisheries. [SEP] Initially, the English were attracted to Canada only by the fish, preferring to concentrate their colonizing activities farther down the American coast. [SEP] The French	came	looking for gold and diamonds, spices, and a passage to Asia. [SEP] In 1535 Jacques Cartier ventured up the St. Lawrence as far as Hochelaga Village, dominated by a hill he named Mont Réal (Mount Royal).

Chouart des Groseilliers (known to Anglo-Canadian schoolchildren as “Radishes and Gooseberries”). [SEP] Exasperated by the cost of the haul to Québec and by the heavy taxes imposed on fur pelts, they sought a new outlet for the fur trade. [SEP] Fearing a commercial threat to the St. Lawrence River, the governor in Québec opposed their survey of the region. [SEP] This decision proved to be the beginning of the end for New France, for Radisson and Groseilliers promptly sold their idea to British merchants, who in 1670 founded the Hudson’s Bay Company. [SEP] Charles II granted this tentacular private joint-stock company control of all territories draining into Hudson Bay; they were named Rupert’s Land after the king’s cousin, who was also titular head of the company. [SEP] Its initials H.B.C.	came	to mean “Here before Christ.” [SEP] It was here to stay. [SEP] The first British fur traders were much less adventurous than the French, waiting for the Indians to bring their pelts to the trading post rather than seeking them out in the forest. [SEP] The coureurs de bois were more adapted to the wilderness and understood the Indians better. [SEP] From them they learned to make swift, light birchbark canoes, snowshoes, and pemmican — a ghastly but nourishing mixture of buffalo fat with bits of dried meat and berries. [SEP] The French also offered higher-quality goods. [SEP] The H.B.C. was a penny-pincher, and Indians soon spotted — and spat out — its raw London gin tinctured with iodine to imitate French brandy.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] And the landscape is a pure joy, with long, narrow glacial lakes fed by cold streams gurgling down the granite mountain slopes of yellow birch, beech, sugar maple, and fir. [SEP] The virgin forests were long a refuge for Algonquin Indians fleeing the Iroquois.

[SEP] Jacques Cartier named the island Ile St-Jean when he spotted it in the 16th century, but the French didn’t colonize it until after their retrenchment following the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. [SEP] Like Nova Scotia, the island was transformed by the Acadians’ deportation and their replacement by New Englanders, who named it after Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, in 1799. [SEP] The New Englanders preferred to exploit their property as absentee landlords, leaving it mainly to Irish and Scottish immigrants to clear the forests for shipbuilding and agriculture.

The First Inhabitants Long before the first European sailors beached in the Canaries, all seven islands were inhabited. [SEP] The original Canarians	came	to be called Guanches, meaning in the native tongue “man.” [SEP] Strictly speaking, this name applies only to the original inhabitants of Tenerife. [SEP] The Guanches are thought to have arrived in the islands around the 1st or 2nd century b.c., probably from North Africa. [SEP] Ethnographers link them with the Cro-Magnon and Proto-Mediterranean race. [SEP] They were tall, light-skinned, often blue-eyed and blond-haired. [SEP] You can see their remains in the meticulous collection of the Museo Canario in Las Palmas on Gran Canaria. [SEP] Here too you can study their preoccupation with death.

The World Is Round!

[SEP] The great navigator definitely stopped off at Gomera and Las Palmas on his voyage of 1492, and he even recorded a volcanic eruption while passing Tenerife. [SEP] Not surprisingly his crew took this as an ill omen, but as history tells us, once past El Hierro they did not drop off the edge of the world after all.

A Brief History During the last fifty years, a great deal of research has been undertaken to discover more about the great ancient societies of the Yucatán. [SEP] Huge sections of their daily lives (and particularly why they	came	to abandon their cities) are still shrouded in mystery, but great strides have been made in deciphering their hieroglyphs and stelae (inscribed stone pillars). [SEP] Despite these mysteries, there are few places in the world where the past feels as close as it does in the Yucatán. [SEP] The thatched huts that appear in 1,000-year-old carvings at Uxmal can be seen today in every roadside village. [SEP] The stone metates, or grinding dishes, which grace many a kitchen in town or village, are identical to those left as offerings to the rain gods in centuries past. [SEP] Away from the cities, the people still speak the Mayan tongue, and their religious beliefs still bear the imprint of the ancient rituals of their ancestors.

[SEP] During the Archaic period (after 5,200 b.c.), these people settled in what is now modern Mexico. [SEP] They developed a primitive agriculture, domesticating cattle and cultivating corn, beans, chili peppers, and squash (a pumpkin-like vegetable) in burned clearings in the jungle. [SEP] Over time, a society developed that was so successful they could devote time to activities other than simple food cultivation. [SEP] These people, known as the Olmec, are considered to be the first Mesoamerican culture, the one from which all others evolved. [SEP] They developed a calendar based on a 52-year cycle. [SEP] They also constructed pyramids for worship. [SEP] By 1500 b.c. the group that	came	to be known as the Maya settled in an area which stretched from the Pacific coast to the southern Yucatán, taking in modern-day Guatemala, Belize, the western parts of El Salvador and Honduras, and the Mexican state of Campeche. [SEP] In the succeeding centuries they migrated into the northern Yucatán — what are now the modern Mexican states of Yucatán, Quintana Roo, and part of Tabasco. [SEP] Though their antecedents are still shadowy, they were much influenced by the Olmec.

Though their antecedents are still shadowy, they were much influenced by the Olmec. [SEP] They developed and refined the Olmec calendar and counting system, and improved their building practices. [SEP] The whole Yucatán peninsula witnessed the flowering of classic Mayan civilization and a society of great sophistication; with its magnificent pyramids, temples, and palaces decorated with wall paintings and carved low-reliefs, a written language of hieroglyphics, and complicated medical procedures to heal the injured or the sick. [SEP] Mayan astronomers tracked the movements of the heavenly bodies, predicting eclipses and marking the times for the planting of the new corn. [SEP] In fact, corn	came	to symbolize life for the Maya — in their myths of creation, mankind was formed from lumps of maize dough. [SEP] Elaborate rituals grew up around the preparation of the milpas (cornfields) and the planting and harvesting of the crop whose success depended on the coming of the annual rains. [SEP] These rituals were undertaken by a small number of initiates who controlled the knowledge of the Maya. [SEP] Because the region has no surface rivers, rain was a precious resource and the Maya saw any stock of water, such as the limestone water holes or cenotes, as holy places. [SEP] The rain god Chaac was a very important deity, whose image can be seen at every Mayan site. [SEP] But there was a dark side to this sophisticated society.

[SEP] The Yucatán declared its independence in 1821 but did not join the fledgling country of Mexico until 1823. [SEP] In 1840, it changed its mind, and withdrew from the union. [SEP] This was the catalyst for the oppressed Maya to take up arms against their colonial oppressors. [SEP] In 1847, a savage uprising known as the Caste War saw Mayan rebels massacre white settlers and take control of nearly two-thirds of the peninsula. [SEP] By 1850 they had driven the Mexicans back to their strongholds in Mérida and Campeche. [SEP] However, in an amazing turnaround, the Maya’s ancient beliefs be	came	their undoing.

[SEP] Parts of the coastline have sandy beaches that seem as if no human has ever set foot on them. [SEP] Of course with the success of Cancún, developers have looked for other opportunities in the region, and this stretch of coastline is gradually being taken for tourist development.

Three hours of traveling will bring you to the small town of Pisté and the remains of one of the most famous Mayan sites. [SEP] Chichén Itzá has fired the imagination of archaeologists and tourists alike. [SEP] No matter how many other people happen to be there when you visit, you cannot help but be impressed by Chichén Itzá. [SEP] It has been well excavated and the huge range of structures give a lasting impression of how life would have been lived by the Mayan elite. [SEP] The city was built late in the empire’s cycle, between the sixth and ninth centuries (the post-Classic period). [SEP] Despite large amount of research, scientists are still not in agreement as to exactly how the city evolved, and what influences	came	to bear. [SEP] What is certain is that Toltec influences, in the form of the god Kukulkán (Quetzalcoatl) and Chaac-Mool reliefs, can be found here, along with traditional Mayan symbols. [SEP] Another mystery yet to be solved is why the Toltec abandoned the city in 1200. [SEP] Some time later, in the 13th century, the Itzá, a Mayan tribe led by a ruler named Itzámna, moved north out of what is now the Campeche province to the tip of Yucatán and settled in the city. [SEP] They gave the city the name Chichén Itzá; this probably means “Mouth of the Well of the Itzás.” [SEP] They founded a capital at Mayapan, near the site of the modern city of Mérida. [SEP] In the 15th century, following a bloody civil war, the Itzás abandoned Chichén Itzá.

[SEP] On the military front, the Han triumphed over marauding Huns and the Central Asian nomads, and Chinese sovereignty was extended almost to today’s frontiers. [SEP] The development of a new crossbow — which was a longer-range and more accurate weapon than China’s foes could deploy — ensured Han supremacy. [SEP] A golden age began, and a university was established in the capital city, Chang’an (now Xi’an). [SEP] Intellectuals, who had been harried by the Qin, were encouraged in their creative endeavors; with the invention of paper, the influence of their writings spread. [SEP] Sculpture, ceramics, and silk manufacture flourished. [SEP] And Buddhism, a new religion,	came	to China from India via Tibet; it was to have an enduring effect on Chinese life and art. [SEP] Like many dynasties before and after, the Han succession ended in a new struggle for power and anarchy. [SEP] As a result, the nation was split into three competing kingdoms. [SEP] The era of the Three Kingdoms lasted only about half a century, but it had as a legacy some thrilling tales of derring-do that later inspired various plays and a classic Ming Dynasty novel. [SEP] And the first mention of tea-drinking in China occurs in the third century, a footnote of fascination for social historians.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
Yet by the beginning of the tenth century, the Tang rulers had lost their grip on the country. [SEP] Revenues from tax collection dwindled, ambitious palace eunuchs plotted, reform schemes failed, and rebellious forces threatened. [SEP] The emperors distributed their largess to too many warlords, hoping to pacify them. [SEP] By 907 the people could see, through all the turmoil and confusion, that the dynasty had lost the “mandate of heaven,” and so it was that the last of the Tang monarchs abdicated. [SEP] Chinese historians designate the next 50 years as the era of “The Five Dynasties and the Ten Kingdoms.” [SEP] This transitional period was marred by political and military infighting, and by rivalry, intrigue, and cruelty. [SEP] Then, an able general named Zhaokuangyin (Chao K’uang-yin)	came	onto the scene and founded the Song (Sung) Dynasty (960–1280), which ensured Chinese cultural supremacy for the next three centuries.

[SEP] He reports all manner of innovations, not least the invention of paper money. [SEP] (Counterfeiting, he reports, had also been discovered.) [SEP] Marco Polo’s account of life in legendary Cathay was received with incredulity in Europe, where it was suggested that his imagination had run wild. [SEP] What else could the citizens of Venice make of his report that the “noble and magnificent city of Kin-sai” (now Hangzhou) had 12,000 bridges, many so high that sailing ships could pass under them? [SEP] In England, schoolboys	came	to call a whopping exaggeration a “Marco Polo.” [SEP] With the death of Kublai Khan (in 1294, at age 80), the Mongols started to lose their grip on China. [SEP] The great emperor’s successors lacked his vision and vigor. [SEP] Insurrection was in the air, met by oppression and resulting in ever more sustained resistance. [SEP] Finally, a full-scale uprising led by a peasant general, Zhuyuanzhang (Chu Yüan-chang), routed the Yuan rulers.

Pigtails and Prosperity The invading “barbarians,” the Manchu, adopted all the refinements of Chinese civilization, installing a regime so conservative that it began to hold back progress. [SEP] But for all their Confucian outlook and traditionalism, the Manchu imposed one singular feature of their own culture: the wearing of pigtails. [SEP] Ironically, this was one peculiarity the rest of the world	came	to consider typically Chinese. [SEP] One of the most dynamic emperors was Kangxi (K’ang-hsi), who reigned at almost the same time as Louis XIV of France. [SEP] He presided over a period of prosperity and positive achievement, rebuilding Beijing, encouraging scholarship, and expanding the empire to its greatest area.

The soaring demand in Europe for Chinese tea, silk, and porcelain brought increasing pressure for freer trade. [SEP] However, the Chinese were stubborn. [SEP] Needing no commodities, they would accept only silver bullion in exchange for goods, thus undermining Britain’s balance of payments. [SEP] Then, at about the turn of the 19th century, wily foreign traders thought of an alternative medium of payment — opium. [SEP] Tons of the drug were brought into China. [SEP] In 1839 the Chinese government finally cracked down on this drain on the treasury, which was also causing mass addiction among the Chinese. [SEP] Some 20,000 chests of opium were confiscated from British merchants in Guangzhou (Canton). [SEP] Retaliation	came	a year later in the first of the Opium Wars, which culminated in a series of “unequal treaties” forced on an increasingly weak Manchu regime. [SEP] China was obliged to open major ports to foreign political and economic penetration; Hong Kong was ceded to Britain. [SEP] Infinitely more costly in human terms was the Taiping Rebellion, which began in 1850 as a peasant revolt. [SEP] There was a struggle between the Qing Dynasty and rebels determined to overthrow such traditional values as respect for religion, private property, and male supremacy. [SEP] The revolt lasted 14 years and cost more lives than would World War I.

[SEP] Demands for reform won the support of the emperor, but his notoriously scheming aunt, the Empress Dowager Cixi (Tz’u Hsi), edged him off the throne. [SEP] Soon after, Cixi had the chance to exploit the Boxer Rebellion (1900), a revolt against foreign influence. [SEP] It was finally put down by the intervention of all the great powers, which joined together in an unprecedented alliance.

Mao Zedong’s “Great Leap Forward” (1959) was designed to mobilize the masses in a crash program of economic growth, but it kept the country in turmoil and brought unconvincing results. [SEP] At about the time the Leap was suddenly reversed, relations between China and the Soviet Union plunged from polite to frosty to hostile.

[SEP] By the ninth century, a large colony of Arabs, Jews, Persians, and others had settled here. [SEP] They traded in tea, silk, and porcelain, all in constant demand abroad. [SEP] It was to be another seven centuries before Europeans established themselves in Canton. [SEP] The Portuguese were first, followed by Spaniards, Dutch, and English.

Guangzhou’s prime Buddhist monument, the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees (Liurongsi), was founded over 1,400 years ago. [SEP] The trees that inspired the 11th-century poet and calligrapher Su Dongpo to name the temple have died, but the often-restored complex remains a focus of local Buddhist activities. [SEP] Overlooking it all is the Flower Pagoda (Huata), a slender relic of the Song Dynasty. [SEP] From the outside, the pagoda appears to be nine tiers high, but there are really 17 floors inside. [SEP] Adjacent is an unusual “death hall,” where the departed (their pictures posted on the walls) are remembered in daily prayers — for a fee, of course. [SEP] In the early medieval period, Guangzhou had a significant Muslim population as a result of trade with the Near East. [SEP] This is how it	came	to pass that the city has what is said to be the oldest mosque in China, the Huaisheng Mosque (built in 627). [SEP] Its white minaret can be climbed via a spiral staircase for a view of the courtyards, gardens, and Guangzhou’s modern skyscrapers. [SEP] The city’s leading tribute to the days of imperial splendor is the Chen Family Temple (Chenjiaci), a memorial to members of a large merchant clan from all over China. [SEP] This sprawling compound of courtyards and showy 19th-century pavilions is decorated in a pantheon of finely carved friezes, gates, and gold-leaf tableaux depicting scenes of Chinese myth and romance.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
oon a modern, German-style city was built, with villas, a deepwater port, a cathedral, and a main street called Kaiser Wilhelmstrasse. [SEP] Business was not everything: the Germans used Qingdao as a missionary base, too. [SEP] It remains one of China’s more Christian cities. [SEP] The twin-spired Catholic cathedral (Tianzhu Jiaotong) and the Protestant church (Jidu Jiaotong), with its working clock tower, tend to be crowded with local people on Sundays and have become tourist attractions. [SEP] German Qingdao suffered a curious fate during World War I. Japan, which joined the Allied forces, invaded the city, imprisoned the survivors of the German garrison, and occupied Qingdao for the duration of the war. [SEP] China wasn’t able to regain sovereignty until 1922. [SEP] After the Communists	came	to power in 1949, industrial development went forward.

[SEP] Having survived years of sandstorms and blizzards, demons and dragons, Xuanzang was feted on his return to the capital in 645.

Excursions from Xi’an The oldest of the region’s archaeological wonders are found in a museum erected on the very site where they were discovered. [SEP] This is at the Stone Age site of Banpo, 10 km (6 miles) east of Xi’an.

[SEP] You can follow the evolution of dwellings in China from round structures to rectangular houses with slanting roofs, the prototypes for today’s typical Chinese abode. [SEP] Also on display in the Banpo Museum (Banpo Bowuguan) are some of the objects found in the course of excavations: axes, fishhooks, and utilitarian pots, as well as artistically decorated ceramics and, most dramatically, the skeletons of these ancient villagers.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
A Brief History Nothing has had a greater impact on the Costa Blanca than foreign invasion: Iberians, Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Visigoths, and Moors had moulded Spain’s Mediterranean shores centuries before international tourism gained a foothold. [SEP] But before any of these were the Costa Blanca’s first inhabitants: Known as Neanderthal men, they lived primitively and spent a large part of their time hunting. [SEP] Then, as the Stone Age	came	to an end, short, dark-skinned Iberians started to make their way from North Africa to the Spanish Peninsula. [SEP] These fierce fighters skilled in guerrilla warfare roamed the Mediterranean foothills, painting a vivid record of their battles on the walls of their rock shelters. [SEP] The Celts began to flood into Spain from the north sometime after 900 b.c. They settled in the north and west of the country, never penetrating as far as the Costa Blanca. [SEP] In central Spain they were slowly absorbed by the reluctant Iberians, but elsewhere both tribes kept fiercely apart, establishing from the first the renowned independence that still characterizes Spain’s provinces.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
After about 650 b.c., Greek traders arrived on the coast to compete for Spain’s rich mineral deposits and fertile land. [SEP] The influence of Greece was short-lived, although the olive and the grape, Greek legacies, are cultivated in the region. [SEP] The Carthaginians, a people related to the Phoenicians,	came	from North Africa and subsequently took over much of southern Spain, beginning with Cádiz in 501 b.c. The town had sought help from the Carthaginian army in its war against local tribes, and the “invited guest” decided to stay. [SEP] The main centre of Carthaginian power in Spain was located on the Costa Blanca: Carthago Nova, now Cartagena, followed in prominence by Alicante. [SEP] Carthage, challenged by Rome in the First Punic War (264–241 b.c.), lost most of her neglected holdings in Spain through Iberian attacks. [SEP] But Carthage’s luck changed with an initial victory in the Second Punic War (218–201 b.c.).

Tapas A tapa is a mouthful of anything that tastes good and fits on a cocktail stick. [SEP] The variety is enormous: smoked mountain ham, spicy sausages, cheese, olives (some as big as pigeon’s eggs), sardines, mushrooms, mussels, squid, octopus, meatballs, fried fish, plus sauces and exotic-looking specialities of the house. [SEP] The name comes from the practice, sadly almost vanished, of providing a free bite with every drink. [SEP] The tidbit was put on a small plate traditionally used to cover the glass and	came	to be called a tapa, which means lid. [SEP] Touring tapas bars is great fun, especially in a town’s old quarter. [SEP] It can be expensive, certainly more than the cost of an orthodox meal, but do try to devote at least an evening to it.

iphate splintered into a number of small kingdoms called taifas, which were constantly at war. [SEP] The Christians in the north, seeing the enemy weakened and divided, captured the taifa of Toledo. [SEP] Under threat of attack, the other taifas sought help from the Almoravids, fanatical Berber warriors. [SEP] The Berbers marched against the Christians in 1086, and went on to reduce Moorish Spain to a province of their own North African Empire. [SEP] For a time, therefore, the affairs of Muslim Spain were administered from the Almoravid headquarters in Granada, until they lost their grip on the peninsula, softened by their life of ease in Andalucía. [SEP] The pattern repeated itself a century later when the Moors invoked the aid of the Almohads in 1151. [SEP] These primitive tribesmen, who	came	from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, soon made themselves the masters of southern Spain. [SEP] They constructed major fortifications, such as Sevilla’s Alcázar, endowing the Moors with sufficient strength to resist the Christian forces a while longer. [SEP] The fortunes of the Moors and Christians swayed back and forth until 1212, when the Christians gained their first decisive victory at Las Navas de Tolosa in northern Andalucía. [SEP] The Christians gradually captured and annexed the former bastions of Moorish rule; in 1236, Córdoba fell to James the Conqueror, followed by Sevilla in 1248.

In military disarray and political decline, Moorish Spain nevertheless saw another two centuries of brilliance under the Nasrid dynasty, founded in Granada by Mohammed I in 1232. [SEP] Refugees from Córdoba and Sevilla flooded into the city, bringing with them their many talents and skills and adding to the city’s brilliance. [SEP] The magnificent palace of the Alhambra provided the setting for a luxurious court life dedicated to the pursuit of literature, music, and the arts. [SEP] Yet, the Moorish fortresses along the coast soon	came	under attack.

Málaga’s international airport is the gateway to the Costa del Sol and Andalucía for most people. [SEP] However, few visitors spend much time in the city itself. [SEP] This is a shame, as Málaga is an ancient Andalucían city of not inconsiderable charm that offers a refreshing taste of the real Spain. [SEP] Founded by Phoenician traders more than 3,000 years ago, it	came	under Carthaginian and Roman rule before falling to the Moorish invasion force in 711. [SEP] The Moors fortified the city, developing the settlement into a major trading port serving Granada, and it was one of the last cities in Spain to be re-conquered by Christian forces in 1487. [SEP] A good place to begin a tour is at Málaga’s principle landmark, Gibralfaro (from the Arabic Jebel al Faro — Lighthouse Hill). [SEP] Located some 130 m (425 ft) above the city, this hilltop is capped by the ramparts of a Phoenician castle reconstructed in the 14th century by the Moors (who went on to build the lighthouse that gave Gibralfaro its name).

Cádiz The ancient city of Cádiz, sitting at the end of a very narrow peninsula of land that runs parallel to the coast, was founded by the Phoenicians in 1100 b.c. and is considered to be Spain’s oldest town. [SEP] In fact, Cádiz’s amazing amalgam of history is not readily apparent, with only the remains of the old Roman Theater to give much evidence of the city’s age. [SEP] It was re-conquered by Alfonso X in 1262 and granted the Monopoly of Trade with Africa by the Catholic Monarchs in 1493. [SEP] Columbus also departed from this city on his second and fourth voyages in 1493 and 1502, respectively. [SEP] In the latter part of the 16th century, it twice	came	under attack by enemy naval forces, and a period of prosperity ensued when the Casa de Contratación, or the monopoly rights for trade with the Americas, was transferred from Sevilla by order of Felipe V in 1717. [SEP] A century later on 19 March 1812, while under attack from Napoleon’s forces, the national parliament met in the St. Felipe Neri Church and proclaimed the first Spanish parliament. [SEP] Of most interest in the town today is the architecturally contrasting Baroque and Classical cathedral, which was constructed between 1772 and 1838. [SEP] The elegant Hospital de Mujeres (Women’s Hospital), built even earlier in 1749, is notable for its patio and art collection, including a fine El Greco.

The name of this town is indicative of two things. [SEP] It once lay close to the frontier of the old Moorish kingdom of Granada, hence de la Frontera. [SEP] And Jerez (pronounced khay-reth) gave its name to the wine that has made the town famous, better known to the world in its anglicized version — sherry. [SEP] Although known as long ago as the Phoenician era, Jerez first	came	to prominence under the Moors in the 11th and 12th centuries, and it is from that period that the impressively walled and towered Alcázar dates. [SEP] Inside is a simple but elegant mosque that was later converted into a chapel dedicated to Santa María la Real.

[SEP] The minaret, dating from 1184, was preserved as the bell tower of the cathedral; this celebrated Giralda tower is Sevilla’s most famous landmark. [SEP] The exterior is beautifully decorated with typical sebka design work. [SEP] It contrasts vividly with the bland interior, where a series of 35 gently elevating ramps lead to an observation platform at a height of 70 m (230 ft). [SEP] Ferdinand III rode his horse to the top following the Reconquista in 1248. [SEP] This is the finest mirador in Sevilla, and provides for unparalleled views of the old city below. [SEP] It is surprising to note just how large the Plaza de Toros is when seen at this angle. [SEP] Look up and you will see how the tower	came	by its name. [SEP] In 1356, an earthquake destroyed the original ornamental top. [SEP] And it wasn’t until 1558 that the addition of the huge bells and a weather vane (Giralda in Spanish) in the form of a statue of a beautiful goddess representing Faith, raised the height to 98 m (322 ft). [SEP] The Alcázar (entrance on far side of the square, through the Puerta del León) is a major monument to mid-14th century Mudéjar architecture, combining Moorish, Gothic, and Renaissance elements. [SEP] Built by Moorish craftsmen under Christian rule, during the reign of Pedro the Cruel, the rambling palace and its several courtyards incorporate fragments of an earlier Moorish fortress, and blend Christian motifs with Moorish designs.

C rete’s long history is bound with its strategic position at the crossroads between Western Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. [SEP] In good times this brought trade, ideas, and prosperity; in bad times — invasion, oppression, and disease. [SEP] Many fascinating legacies around the island attest to the complicated web that time has spun here. [SEP] Each era has left its distinctive mark. [SEP] The earliest human remains found on Crete date back to the seventh millennium b.c. These first inhabitants were Neolithic cave dwellers who	came	from Asia Minor. [SEP] They developed into farmers with settlements and pastureland on the fertile Messará Plain. [SEP] It was an influx of new settlers with Bronze Age skills around 3000 b.c. that ushered in the Minoan era, the first major civilization to arise on European soil. [SEP] The Minoans	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
The Minoans developed into one of the great naval powers of the Mediterranean, with the wood from the vast cypress forests providing material for boats. [SEP] But they concentrated their power more for commercial than military gain, showing a taste for the good life rather than a hunger for an empire. [SEP] This great civilization	came	to a sudden, catastrophic end around 1450 b.c. The exact cause remains unknown, but all the palaces were destroyed at the same time. [SEP] The charred remains at Knossós and ash at Zákros suggest a great conflagration. [SEP] A leading theory for many years was that natural disaster struck the island in the wake of the volcanic explosion on the island of Thíra (Santorini), due north of Crete, bringing a maelstrom of tidal waves, earthquakes, and fire storms. [SEP] The most recent research has uncovered evidence supporting another hypothesis — that an attack by invaders or rebel forces may have brought about the end of this fine culture.

There were sporadic attempts at revolt, often launched from remote mountain strongholds where rebels could survive in safety. [SEP] The more vulnerable communities on the lower plains paid a high price for these in the form of swift bloody reprisals. [SEP] The first major rebellion occurred in 1770 when the Russians, hoping to distract the Turks while they waged their own attacks on the Ottoman Empire elsewhere, promised support to Dhaskaloyiánnis, a wealthy shipowner. [SEP] He raised a revolt in Sfakiá, but the support never arrived. [SEP] The rebellion was crushed, Dhaskaloyiánnis was flayed alive, and the event be	came	the subject of a rousing epic poem. [SEP] There were notable uprisings in 1828 when its leaders were killed at Frangokástello, and in 1866 when 2,000 people died in a suicide bombing at Arkádi Monastery. [SEP] It is not surprising that at this time many town-dwelling Cretans kept a low profile. [SEP] They publicly converted to Islam to escape heavy taxes, continuing to practice their Orthodox faith in secret. [SEP] However, once Greece had achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire after the War of 1821, the atmosphere changed. [SEP] Though Crete had to endure nearly a century more of subjection to Turkish domination it stirred the blood of many native sons who vowed to rid the island of its oppressors.

[SEP] At the center of gallery 14 is the only stone sarcophagus found on the island. [SEP] Spiral decoration frames scenes of libation and other religious activities. [SEP] At the far end of the hall you will be able to examine a miniature recreation of the palace of Knossós, completed according to early hypotheses on its design. [SEP] Room 17 houses a once private collection — that of Irackliot doctor Stylianós Giamalákis — which	came	to the state in 1962.

in the Old Palace era, but this was destroyed by a massive earthquake only 300 years later. [SEP] Most of the remains seen at the site today constitute the second palace built following the disaster which also coincided with a Golden Age of Minoan society or the New Palace era — 1700 [SEP] b.c. [SEP] , when the people were rich through trade, and artistic endeavor was at its peak. [SEP] The palace grew continuously through the following years resulting in a complex of around 1200 small rooms several stories high covering over 20,000 sq m (215,278 sq ft). [SEP] The construction was immensely complicated with light wells illuminating lower chambers and polythyra, masonry supports to create structural integrity, between which were large wooden doors serving as partitions. [SEP] The golden era	came	to an end in 1450 [SEP] b.c. [SEP] and major fire caused catastrophic damage around 1350 [SEP] b.c. [SEP] , but though the palace was completely destroyed the site continued to be occupied until the 5th century [SEP] a.d. [SEP] The palace was erected around a large Central Court, used for public meetings, which now forms the heart of the site. [SEP] Imagine Minoans at play here as depicted on the pottery and frescoes in the Archaeological Museum in Iráklion — acrobats and dancers as well as the famed bull leapers. [SEP] Visitors enter past what remains of the West Court used as an entryway to a West Wing, where the administrative and religious activities took place.

The Phaistós disc was discovered here in 1903 but not in any of the important Palatial-era rooms. [SEP] It was discovered by workmen on the northern edge of the site in a tiny clay walled chamber. [SEP] The disc, said to date from 1700 b.c., is covered with a spiral pattern of symbols and geometric forms that have yet to be deciphered. [SEP] You can see the original in the Archaeological Museum in Iráklion; or buy a copy at any souvenir store. [SEP] Just 3 km (2 miles) from Phaistós is Agía Triáda, built, archaeologists believe, as a summer palace for the royal court and linked to the city by Minoan road. [SEP] Set on a hillside overlooking the Gulf of Messará it offered excellent views and cooling sea breezes as the sea	came	much closer in those days. [SEP] The remains indicate a series of blocks of rooms that could work as a whole or could operate individually if needed. [SEP] Perhaps this was to accommodate different sizes of entourage at different times. [SEP] The west wing of the palace housed the royal quarters. [SEP] Agía Triáda was built late in the Minoan era, around 1700 b.c. and though it suffered great damage in the cataclysm of 1450 b.c., it was reoccupied, and a Dorian town was built nearby. [SEP] Since this was famed in its time for several shrines, scholars have debated that the original palace may have had some religious purpose. [SEP] Numerous tombs have been excavated on the hillside, and the sarcophagi in the Iráklion museum, finely decorated with cult scenes, was found here.

[SEP] In the shallows off its southern tip are the remains of the Greco-Roman city of Ólous and just beyond the bridge a 4th-century a.d. mosaic within the foundations of an early Christian basilica. [SEP] But it is the north of the island that attracts most visitors. [SEP] Here, on a small rocky sub-islet are the remains of the Venetian stronghold of Spinalónga, built in 1579 to protect the entrance to this sheltered bay. [SEP] Its strong bastions and high ‘curtains’ were never taken by an enemy. [SEP] The Venetian garrison remained here until 1715, over 60 years after the fall of Iráklion, and only left after a treaty gave them safe passage. [SEP] The Turks in turn retreated to the island when they	came	under threat from Cretan rebels at the end of the 19th century. [SEP] At the beginning of the 20th century, the Cretan council decided to open a leper colony on the island; whether this was an attempt to force the Turks to leave is open to debate but the disease was rampant on the main island and Spinalónga’s position — offshore yet not too remote — was considered ideal for study of the disease and a quarantine for its sufferers. [SEP] Initially, the regime was harsh, with fear and ignorance causing victims to be treated more like criminals than patients; however, conditions improved over the years until the colony was disbanded in 1957.

The island of Santorini (also called Thirá) is one of the ‘must see’ places in the world. [SEP] Arriving by sea brings the stunning vista slowly into view allowing the full magnitude of its structure to open out in front of you, for Santorini frames the largest volcanic crater in the world. [SEP] A massive eruption of its volcano around 1500 b.c. carried the whole interior of the island high into the atmosphere, changing the climate of the earth for years afterwards. [SEP] In place of land	came	water, surging in to fill the 11-km (7-mile) long void and causing massive tidal waves around the Mediterranean Sea. [SEP] What remains today is the outer rim of the original circular island.

[SEP] They’re made from a secret recipe handed down to the present-day villagers by their Mallorcan ancestors, who	came	here in the early 17th century as part of an official repopulation scheme. [SEP] After Tárbena comes the finest scenery of all: bold, terraced mountains, wide undulating valleys, and scattered farms connected by mule tracks.

The Hort del Cura (Priest’s Grove) is celebrated even in Elche for its cactus, pomegranate, and orange trees, and above all, for the palmera imperial. [SEP] This male tree of exceptional age and size has seven branches growing from one main trunk. [SEP] The palmera imperial and many other trees in the grove have been dedicated to royalty and celebrities like Carmen Polo de Franco, the widow of the Generalísimo. [SEP] Overlooking the grove’s lily pond is an exact replica of the famous bust of the Dama de Elche (The Lady of Elche).

The early history of Nepal is a mixture of fact and myth; religious lore is associated with virtually every landmark and event. [SEP] Actually, so intertwined are legend and history that it is often impossible to determine where fact leaves off and legend begins. [SEP] The prime example of this commingling of fact and fiction involves the origin of the Kathmandu Valley. [SEP] Legend holds that the Kathmandu Valley was once a vast lake, upon which floated a giant lotus flower, from which emanated the light of Swayambhu, the primordial Buddha. [SEP] When the Tibetan god Manjushri	came	to view this light, he was unable to get close enough for a good look, so he took his great sword and slashed through the mountains surrounding the valley to release the waters of the lake. [SEP] (That is the myth. The fact, according to geologists, is that the Kathmandu Valley was indeed once a lake, though the valley’s waters now drain through the narrow cleft of Chobar Gorge, which was most likely created by a large earthquake.) [SEP] One side effect of Manjushri’s draining of the lake was that the snake gods called Nagas, which lived in water, were left with no place to live. [SEP] So, once again Manjushri interceded and created a pond for them to live in. [SEP] This pond still exists today not far from Chobar Gorge.

[SEP] In 640, Bhrikuti and her Chinese co-wife converted Srongtsen Gampo to Buddhism. [SEP] Bhrikuti is venerated as the “Green Tara” and the Chinese wife as the “White Tara.” [SEP] Their images are prominent in Nepalese Buddhist art. [SEP] Commercial and cultural links with Tibet, and through Tibet with China, were strengthened at this time. [SEP] More reliable records come with the next major dynasty, the Malla, who were established in about 1200 by the strongman Ari Malla. [SEP] The Malla	came	to Nepal in the first of several waves of Hindu fugitives from the 11th-century Muslim invasion of northern India. [SEP] Many of the refugees were nobles of the Chetri warrior caste from Rajasthan; forging new feudal states in Nepal, they were responsible for reinforcing Hinduism at the expense of Buddhism. [SEP] The Kathmandu Valley itself was raided in 1336 by the Muslim Sultan of Bengal.

Beaubourg East of the Forum des Halles, streets closed to traffic and lined with cafés, brasseries, art galleries, and boutiques link up with the startling Centre Georges-Pompidou. [SEP] This avant-garde multimedia cultural center, which also houses the Musée National d’Art Moderne (see page 74), reopened 1 January 2000 after lengthy renovation. [SEP] Controversy raged for years after the 1977 opening of this colorful “oil refinery.” [SEP] The comparison	came	as no surprise to the architects, Italy’s Renzo Piano and Britain’s Richard Rogers, who deliberately left the building’s service systems visible — and color-coded. [SEP] Now, as with the Tour Eiffel and the Louvre’s Pyramid, people have learned to live with it and even love it, and it averages 23,000 visitors every day. [SEP] Besides its permanent art collections and popular library open to all, ingenious exhibits cover every aspect of contemporary life, artistic and technological, and the aesthetics of consumer culture. [SEP] There is a particular emphasis on young people. [SEP] The place also offers a terrific view. [SEP] Pay the museum admission, then take the escalators running in transparent tubes from the bottom left to the top right hand corner and see Paris unfold before your eyes. 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
Latin Quarter As far back as the 13th century, when Paris’s first university moved from the cloisters of Notre-Dame to the Left Bank, the young	came	to the quartier to learn Latin. [SEP] Here, the tradition of scholastic inquiry has often evolved into a spirit of protest and outright revolt before subsiding into a lifelong skepticism. [SEP] In ancient days the university simply meant a collection of scholars who met on a street corner or in a public square or courtyard to listen to a lecture given from a bench or balcony. [SEP] Now the tradition of open-air discussion continues over coffee or a glass of wine on some café terrace on the boulevard St-Michel or in the streets around the faculty buildings.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
The Prime Minister’s splendid residence, Hôtel Matignon at 57 rue de Varenne, is a short walk from the National Assembly. [SEP] Its private park has a music pavilion favored for secret strategy sessions. [SEP] On the same elegant 18th-century street, the Musée Rodin at number 77 houses the sculptor’s works in the delightful Hôtel Biron (see page 75). [SEP] Most important sight in the neighborhood is the monumental Hôtel des Invalides, established by Louis XIV as the first national hospital and retirement home for soldiers wounded in action. [SEP] At one time it housed approximately 6,000 veterans, but Napoléon took over a large part of it for the Musée de l’Armée (Army Museum). [SEP] Then the Invalides	came	to symbolize the glory of Napoléon himself, when his remains were finally brought back from St. Helena in 1840 for burial in the chapel under the golden Dôme. [SEP] His son, who died in Vienna, is buried in the crypt, his remains transferred here by Adolf Hitler in 1940. [SEP] The main courtyard allows access to the adjoining church of St-Louis-des-Invalides, decorated with flags taken by French armies in battle. [SEP] The courtyard itself contains the 18 cannons, including eight taken from Vienna, which Napoléon ordered fired on great occasions — including the birth of his son in 1811. [SEP] The cannon sounded again for the 1918 Armistice and the funeral of Marshal Foch in 1929.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
What remains for most people the ultimate monument was a resounding success right from the start. [SEP] In 1889, two million visitors paid 5 francs a head to climb to the top and it has bewitched the world ever since. [SEP] Some monuments celebrate heroes, commemorate victories, honor kings or saints. [SEP] This is a monument for its own sake. [SEP] Its construction for the 1889 World’s Fair was an astounding engineering achievement — some 15,000 pieces of metal joined by 2,500,000 rivets, soaring 320 m (984 ft) into the sky on a base only 130 m (430 ft) across. [SEP] At the time, it was the tallest structure in the world. [SEP] It also provided the perfect perch for transmitters when radio and TV	came	along. [SEP] On the tower’s inauguration, the lifts were not yet in operation and Prime Minister Tirard, aged 62, stopped at the first platform, 57 m (187 ft) up, letting his younger Minister of Commerce continue to the top to present Gustave Eiffel with the Legion of Honor medal. [SEP] Conceived as a temporary structure just for the Fair, the tower was slated for destruction in 1910, but nobody had the heart to take it down. [SEP] New illumination was installed in 1985 to light up the tower from within, and it was the obvious main focus of France’s celebrations for the change of the millennium in 1999.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
At the beginning of the 18th century, Poland entered a prolonged period of decline, marked by financial ruin, a debilitated military, and a series of ineffectual kings. [SEP] Poland was transformed into a client state of the Russians, and then lost much of its western territory to the Prussians during the Silesian Wars that ended in 1763. [SEP] The following year Stanislaw August Poniatowski was elected the last king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Poland soon faced one of its most humiliating episodes. [SEP] The powerful Prussians	came	up with a plan to partition Poland, which gained the support of the Russians. [SEP] The imposed treaty in 1772 robbed Poland of nearly a third of its lands. [SEP] Yet Poniatowski recovered to preside over a reform movement that precipitated the creation of the 1791 Constitution, which restored the hereditary monarchy and overhauled Poland’s political system. [SEP] The liberal constitution, the oldest in the modern world after that of the United States, provided for the separation of powers among legislative, judicial and executive branches of the government. [SEP] None of these reforms pleased the Russians and Prussians, who continued to covet Polish territory. [SEP] Russia invaded Poland and in 1792-1793 it, along with Prussia, imposed a second partition of Poland, annulling the constituti	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Poland-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
A Brief History T he early history of Portugal is closely related to that of the entire Iberian peninsula. [SEP] Prehistoric cultures flourished first in the north and in today’s Alentejo region of south-central Portugal. [SEP] The south was visited by a number of peoples who	came	primarily to trade, including the Phoenicians, the Mycenaean Greeks, and the Carthaginians. [SEP] The Phoenicians established a trading post at Lisbon around 1200 b.c, calling it either Alis Ubbo or Olissipo. [SEP] When Celtic peoples crossed the Pyrenees in the first millennium b.c., they intermarried with the existing Iberian population and built a series of hilltop fort communities or citânias, the finest example of which is at Briteiros (see page 73). [SEP] The Carthaginians, under Hannibal, recruited locals to fight as mercenaries against Rome. [SEP] The Romans eventually defeated the Carthaginians and invaded the Iberian peninsula. [SEP] Their occupation was fiercely opposed by a confederation of Celts, known as the Lusitani, living in central Portugal. [SEP] The Lusitanian leader, Vi	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
Portugal and Spain, the planet’s foremost maritime powers, agreed to divide the world between them by means of the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas. [SEP] This accorded everything lying more than 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands to Spain, while everything lying to the east went to Portugal, thus giving Portugal a free hand in exploiting the Orient. [SEP] In 1500, Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral accidentally reached Brazil. [SEP] Trading posts were set up all along the west and east coasts of Africa, in the Middle East (Hormuz), southern India (Goa), Malaysia (Malacca), and even in China (Macau). [SEP] Profits	came	primarily from trading in eastern spices, silk and porcelain, African gold, and slaves, as well as through importing copious sugar from Brazil and São Tomé. [SEP] Wealth helped disguise inherent weaknesses in the Portuguese state. [SEP] It was not long before other nations, such as the English and the Dutch, began challenging the Portuguese monopoly on the spice trade.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
rtugal as an enlightened despot, banishing the Jesuits and executing certain members of the nobility who may have been involved in an assassination attempt on the king. [SEP] He abolished slavery, reformed education, and diversified Portuguese trade. [SEP] Although he lost his hold on power shortly after José’s death in 1777, many of his reforms survived, laying the foundation for the modern Portuguese state. [SEP] At the beginning of the 19th century, Napoleon managed to drag Portugal into the heat of Europe’s conflicts. [SEP] France invaded in 1807 when Portugal refused to close its ports to British shipping. [SEP] The royal family fled to Brazil aboard a British ship and the British general, Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington), countered the invasions. [SEP] The final battle	came	in 1810–1811, when the French, unable to pass the huge fortifications at Torres Vedras, retreated back to Spain.

Toward the Present Salazar’s New State began to unravel when Portugal’s former colonies demanded independence. [SEP] In 1974, soldiers carrying red carnations in their rifle barrels successfully deposed the government in a peaceful coup that	came	to be known as the “Carnation Revolution.” [SEP] Portugal then disengaged itself from Mozambique and Angola, its seething colonial possessions in Africa, and the country absorbed the million or so refugees who fled to a motherland most had never seen. [SEP] Portugal suffered several years of political confusion, but stable democracy finally took hold. [SEP] With its entry into the European Union (formerly the European Economic Community) in 1986, the pace of development suddenly quickened.

Some 20 km (12 miles) from Guarda is tiny Belmonte, with a carefully restored 13th-century castle and Jewish Quarter, home to this day to a Jewish community. [SEP] Covilhã, a further 20 km (12 miles) south, has become a base for exploring the Serra because of its location close to the highest peaks and the ski fields. [SEP] This mountainous area produced several explorers who would help form the Portuguese empire: From Covilhã	came	Pêro de Covilhã, who explored India and Ethiopia in the late 15th century, and born in Belmonte was Pedro Álvares Cabral, who discovered Brazil in 1500.

Évora Évora (150 km/93 miles east of Lisbon) is the acclaimed star of the Alentejo. [SEP] Originally a Roman settlement and center of learning, Évora is now a city of splendid Renaissance buildings, mostly dating from its heyday as the base of the House of Aviz (rulers of Portugal from the 14th century until the Spanish Hapsburgs took over in 1581). [SEP] By the 17th century, Évora had lost influence and development	came	to a halt, preserving the city’s distinctive 16th-century palácios for posterity. [SEP] The major sights are enclosed within two rings of concentric walls and tucked among Évora’s great maze of Moorish alleys and squares (praças). [SEP] The distinctive main square, Praça do Giraldo, is marked by Moorish arches and an attractive 16th-century fountain in its center. [SEP] The tourist office is located here.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
Soon after this, the Spanish began building a thick defensive wall all around San Juan. [SEP] With an average height of 40 feet (12 m), it was a formidable site, and is still one of the most impressive parts of the old city. [SEP] It seems to have impressed generations of marauders; once it was complete, they stayed away for more than 150 years. [SEP] A final British rally against Puerto Rico	came	in 1797. [SEP] Seven thousand troops under Sir Ralph Abercromby landed east of San Juan and blockaded the city. [SEP] For two weeks the battle see-sawed. [SEP] Finally, as suddenly and unexpectedly as they had arrived, the British retired. [SEP] According to one version, it was all because of St. Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins. [SEP] On the last night of the siege, devout local women, led by their bishop, marched through the streets of old San Juan in a torchlight parade praying for deliverance. [SEP] The legend says General Abercromby heard the church bells tolling, saw the lights, mistakenly deduced that Spanish reinforcements had arrived, and fled.

Ponce Puerto Rico’s second city, Ponce is as much steeped in history as Old San Juan. [SEP] Founded in 1692, it was named after a relative of Juan Ponce de León, not the famous explorer himself. [SEP] Ponce is a thriving port city, very modern in many ways, but it lives up to its name of “Pearl of the South.” [SEP] At the very heart of the city is a jewel of an old town, well-preserved thanks to a massive and expensive restoration program begun in the 1980s. [SEP] Hundreds of careworn buildings were brought back to life, and power cables were buried underground and out of sight. [SEP] Along with this physical transformation	came	a cultural change: Ponce has become a focus for social events that celebrate Puerto Rican history and tradition; several major festivals are held here throughout the year. [SEP] The focus of the city is Parque Degetau in Plaza Las Delicias (Delight Square), known by most locals as Plaza de Ponce. [SEP] Most of what you want to see is within a few minutes’ walk of this plaza, and cafés and restaurants for refreshments are also near at hand. [SEP] You can spend a wonderful morning just soaking in the atmosphere. [SEP] The park, with its shady trees, cooling fountains, and somber bronze statues, including one of Luis Muñoz Marín, is where people come to take a break from the midday heat. [SEP] There’s also a good ice-cream shop on the east side of the square.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	3
As Las Peñas grew, San Sebastián faded. [SEP] At its peak in the late 1800s, San Sebastián was one of the most productive mining towns in all Mexico, with a population of over 20,000 (today it has fewer than 2,000 residents). [SEP] In 1912, governmental functions were moved to Las Peñas, and by 1819, Las Peñas was designated as a municipality, and its name changed to Puerto Vallarta. [SEP] Without any highways or an airport to connect it to other major cities, Puerto Vallarta remained in secluded tranquility for almost 50 years — until the 1963 filming of Night of the Iguana. [SEP] The Hollywood production attracted the attention of the international media, who	came	looking for gossip about the torrid romances of the film’s legendary stars. [SEP] Night of the Iguana’s biggest star, however, turned out to be the quaint village of Puerto Vallarta. [SEP] The movie’s leading man, Richard Burton, and his new love, Elizabeth Taylor, were so charmed by the town that they bought homes there, as did director John Huston.

 Nao (1587) and got away with 1.2 million in gold. [SEP] To guard the port from these attacks, the Spaniards built the impressive Fuerte de San Diego in 1616. [SEP] Although an earthquake destroyed it in 1776, the fort was rebuilt in 1783, and today houses a small but interesting museum. [SEP] The Nao trade route continued until the early 1800s, when José María Morelos y Pavón, a hero of Mexico’s War of Independence, took over Acapulco and stopped the trade, sending the town into a century-long respite, a hiatus that ended only when the Mexican government paved the highway between Mexico City and Acapulco. [SEP] The beautiful beaches of Acapulco Bay immediately lured Mexico City’s elite, and the metamorphosis began, from slumbering trading port into the “Pearl of the Pacific,” as the media	came	to know it in the 1930s.
