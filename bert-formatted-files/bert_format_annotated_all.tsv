Despite periodic cleanups of the accumulated trash at the site, the shooters who used the range didn't take responsibility for it. [SEP] After some livestock were shot and killed on neighboring private land, there were calls to close the range completely. [SEP] To turn things around, the BlM closed the site for two weeks for a cleanup and then posted a law enforcement ranger at the entrance to screen those coming to the range. [SEP] The BlM said people who	arrived	with appliances, glass botles, paint cans, pumpkins, furniture, pallets, and such were told to take them back home. [SEP] Shooters who seemed somewhat careless, young, and inexperienced were more carefully watched. [SEP] " My goal was to educate, not to hammer people, " said Chuck Ward, the ranger who monitored the shooters.	natural	COCA; 2012; Apr 2012; KEEPING RANGES OPEN; Snow, John B; MAG: Outdoor Life	arrive	natural	natural	3	say	accompaniment	with appliances, glass botles, paint cans, pumpkins, furniture, pallets, and such		went	came	drove	walked	arrived

The second tale apparently has nothing to do with the first.

That kind of radio consolidation might not make you mad if, like seemingly most of the world's media-savvy twenty- and thirtysomethings, you don't spend your mornings listening to drive-time radio. [SEP] That kind of consolidation has trickled down into newsrooms as well, meaning that local news coverage on most commercially owned radio stations is almost non-existent, just like local flair. [SEP] As McChesney puts it, " Fifty years ago when you	drove	from New York to California, every station would have a whole different sound to it because there would be different people talking.

Congress extended airline and aircraft industry workers' unemployment benefits 26 weeks as part of the $79 billion budget for the war.

[SEP] In looking for work outside the aircraft industry, workers say they have been stigmatized. [SEP] Mrs. Salter was interviewed for a $6.50-an-hour housekeeping job at a hospital and was turned down when the hospital learned she was a Boeing refugee. [SEP] " They thought I'd	go	back there if I could, " she said. For more than three times the pay the hospital was offering, she said, " I would if I could.
