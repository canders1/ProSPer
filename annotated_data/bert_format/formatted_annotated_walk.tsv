I live in an apartment building in a major American city. [SEP] I recently have been aggressively contacted by my downstairs neighbor about how the noise I make is disrupting her sleep. [SEP] At first I was told that it sounded like every night I was moving furniture around my bedroom (I'm not), and now she says that the noise from me	walking	across the room and getting into bed, or my cats walking around, or me even putting a glass of water down on a table fills her whole apartment with unbearable noise. [SEP] I bought more area rugs and I am trying to keep it down, but I am baffled.	natural	COCA; 2019 (19-07-09); Help! My Boyfriend's Family Is a Total Disaster.

Lack of exercise is a major reason for the rise of obesity in the United States. [SEP] Between our desk jobs and our automobiles, we don't move our bodies enough to ward off the gain in fat that comes with aging.
