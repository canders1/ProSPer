there's nothing in the world i love more, not even a third as much <eos> me and mark <eos> i wanted to fall asleep there, for maybe three hundred hours, and dream that i was the object of mark's fancy <eos> there is no way for him to escape me <eos> # i have thought that i have seen him <eos> at a train station, buying a magazine, but i couldn't stop to look or i would have missed my train <eos> once, two years ago, walking back from my high school, i thought i saw him go
