Consider, says Feynman, all the pathways that start at the photon gun and end up at the same point on the photon-counting surface. Nearly parallel, nearly straight-line pathways, have nearly the same action. So when those pathways interact, they have nearly the same phase, and their interaction yields constructive interference, which tends to build up amplitude. Thus, pathways that are near the classical pathway interact constructively to build up amplitude. By contrast, quirky crooked pathways between the photon gun and the same point on the counter screen have very dierent actions, hence very dierent phases, and interact destructively, so their amplitudes tend to cancel. The classical pathway, therefore, is simultaneously the most probable pathway over the sum of histories of all possible pathways, and the pathway that requires the least action.<n>The result is beautiful, but has two problems. First, Feynman assumes a continuous background space and time in his theory. Quantum gravity, as we will see, cannot make that assumption in the first place. Rather space, or geometry, is a discrete, self-constructing object on its own. Thus, achieving a smooth space and time is supposed to be a consequence of an adequate theory of quantum gravity. If Feynman’s sum over histories must assume a smooth background space and time, then it cannot as such be taken as primitive in quantum gravity. Second, granting a continuous background space and time, Feynman’s sum over all histories still only gives a maximum of the amplitude for the photon to travel the classical pathway, it never gives an actual photon arriving at the counting surface. No more than any other does Feynman overcome the fundamental linearity of quantum mechanics. We still have to collapse the wave function. Despite these problems, Feynman’s results are brilliant, and at least we see a link between the classical and quantum worlds, if not yet actual photons striking counters.<n>But there is an alternative approach to the link between the quantum and the classical worlds. This possible approach is based on the well-established phenomenon of “decoherence.” Decoherence arises when a quantum-coherent Schrödinger wave is propagating and the quantum system interacts with another quantum system having many coupled variables, or degrees of freedom. The consequence can be that the Schrödinger wave function of the first quantum system becomes entangled in very complex ways with the other complex quantum system, which may be thought of as the environment. Rather like water waves swirling into tiny granular nooks and crannies along a rugged fractal beach, the initial coherent Schrödinger equation representing the initial quantum system swirls into tiny and highly diverse patterns of interaction with the quantum system representing the environment. The consequence of this intermixing is decoherence.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt
Arguably James Clerk Maxwell was the greatest scientist of the nineteenth century, notwithstanding giants such as Carnot, Boltzmann, and Darwin. While his most radical work is captured in the Maxwell equations for electromagnetic fields, which introduced the fundamental concept of fields into physics, Maxwell concerned himself deeply with the puzzle Carnot had raised in what is now called the second law of thermodynamics.<n>Consider again a thermodynamically isolated system. That is, consider some box containing a gas, isolated from any change in its energy or mass arriving from the outside. There are N gas particles in the box, and as noted earlier, we can consider the positions and momenta of all N particles. Each position and each momentum can be decomposed into three numbers defining position and motion in the three spatial directions. Hence, the entire state of the N particles of gas can be defined by N numbers, plus a specification of the interior boundaries of the box.<n>As described above, all the possible states of this N system of particles can be divided into very small volumes of states, which we will call microstates. Again, as noted in chapter , a macrostate is a collection of microstates. In particular, the equilibrium macrostate is a collection of microstates having the property that the gas particles are nearly uniformly distributed in the box, with a characteristic equilibrium distribution of velocities that Maxwell himself worked out. This equilibrium macrostate has the further important properties that () vastly many microstates are in the equilibrium macrostate; () a few macroscopic features  temperature, pressure, and volume  suce to specify the equilibrium macrostate.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
All of which brings us, inevitably, to the brink of semantics.<n>It is simple at its roots, you see. An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is (i) food; (ii) poison; (iii) a signal; (iv) neutral; (v) something else.<n>Once there is an autonomous agent, there is a semantics from its privileged point of view. The incoming molecule is “yuck” or “yum.” I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent. And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind. If yum, then there will probably be more of this type of agent, osprings of the first. If yuck, it is not so likely this lineage will prosper.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt
Cells that are yammering at one another probably never reach their attractors. Pick a subset, M, of the states in each cell in the community as its “action” states. Now release the community, numerically, somewhere on the edge-of-chaos surface. Over a long period of time, the M action states will be encountered in some order, yielding some probability distribution of transitions between pairs of the M states, as each cell is perturbed by S chemical signals from C other cell types. The transitions among the M action states of each cell can be written in a matrix showing the transition probabilities between any pair of the M states. From this it is possible to calculate the mutual information, MI, between pairs of the M action states.<n>MI is H(A) + H(B) - H(AB). Here H(A) is the entropy of A, H(B) the entropy of B, and H (AB) is the joint entropy of A and B. If A and B are occurring randomly with respect to one another, then H(AB) equals the sum of H(A) + H(B), so MI is . If either A or B is unchanging, MI is again . But if A and B are changing in correlated ways, MI is positive. Hence, we can ask what value of M maximizes the mutual information among the M states, how is that related to cell and community position on the edge-of-chaos phase transition in Figure ., and how well does the mutual information among the M action states correlate with the mutual information in the patterns of CS input signals arriving at each cell type? More broadly, can selection maximize both M and that mutual information correlation and, if so, for what value of M and where on or o the phase transition surface in Figure .?<n>I do not know the answers but hope the optimal point lies on the phase transition surface, for such selected mutual information correlation would begin to show that such communities of cells with such regulatory networks can indeed make the maximum number of reliable discriminations and act on them without trembling hands to make a complex living in a complex world.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt

When war broke out in Europe in 1939, Bermuda’s growing tourist industry all but collapsed. The ships were commandeered to carry troops or become floating hospitals, and the waters around the islands were infested with German submarines. Bermuda played an important role in intelligence. In the basements of the Princess and Bermudiana hotels, more than a thousand British experts analyzed communications intercepted between the western hemisphere and Europe. Mail quietly removed from refueling ships and planes was steamed open and tested for microdots and invisible codes, an important contribution to the struggle against Axis spying activity. The big hotels stayed in business by serving as billets for servicemen and civilian war workers.<n>Just as the first British M15 intelligence operatives were arriving in Hamilton in August 1940, the Lend-Lease Act was negotiated between Britain and the US. Under a 99-year lease, the US acquired about one-tenth of the land area of Bermuda for the development of naval and air bases, modernizing the defenses of Britain’s “Gibraltar of the West.”<n>Changing Times<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-history.txt
Postwar, the British military presence dwindled, and the main sections of the dockyard were closed in 1951. They were deserted for a number of years before being brought to life as a tourist attraction. Today, the Royal Naval Dockyard, on Ireland Island North, has been reborn with a number of sights and activities. You could certainly spend a morning or an afternoon exploring here.<n>Start your tour at the Bermuda Maritime Museum, opened in 1975 by Queen Elizabeth II. If traveling by bus (Routes #7 or #8), you will alight at the last stop; arriving by ferry, you should turn right from the ferry port and follow the footpath around the dock, where you will see the walls of the central fortress (or “keep”) rising in front of you. The museum is entered through a large archway beyond a moat. It covers 21⁄2 hectares (6 acres), and various collections are housed in the old brick military buildings, most of which date from the Victorian era. Where ordnance was once stored there are now collections of coins and treasure salvaged from the ocean floor. You will also find displays of diving equipment used over the centuries to explore the shipwrecks that can be found all around the treacherous reefs off the coast here.<n>The Boat Loft houses a collection reflecting Bermuda’s innovative local designs, including a fully rigged, gleamingly polished “fitted dinghy,” famed for the size of its enormous sail. Such boats were developed to allow quick access to incoming ships. In the early days, pilots were in competition with each other to reach incoming cargoes first and thus secure the business. The exhibit also details the role Bermuda has played in the world of competitive sailing. On an island where shipbuilding was an important industry, men had the skills to design and produce fast boats. Racing started as an informal pastime, but in 1840 Samuel Triscott (a local victualer) organized the first regatta. The Bermuda Royal Yacht Club was organized in 1844 for gentlemen yachtsmen, not long after the founding of the Bermuda Native Yacht Club (BNYC) for native boatmen (many of whom were working pilots and crewmen).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
The first foreign visitors to the Canaries are thought to have been Arab sailors who landed on Gran Canaria some 2,000 years ago and were met warmly. In later centuries the islanders’ gracious hospitality was to cost them dearly.<n>Europeans did not arrive until the 14th century, when the Genoese sailor Lanzarotto Marcello colonized the island, known then in native tongue as Tytheroygatra and subsequently as Lanzarote. Slave traders, treasure seekers, and missionaries all followed in Lanzarotto’s wake, but it was not until 1402 that the European conquest of the Canaries began in earnest. At its helm was the Norman baron, Jean de Béthencourt, under service to Henry III, king of Castile. After the baron had taken Lanzarote and Fuerteventura with comparative ease, his ships were scattered by storms off Gran Canaria. He next turned to El Hierro, where the awestruck islanders welcomed the new visitors arriving in their great floating vessels as gods. Béthencourt returned the hospitality by inviting the natives aboard his ships. He then took them captive and sold them into slavery.<n>Around this time the Portuguese, who had also been colonizing the Atlantic, turned their attention to the Canaries. Naval skirmishes ensued between the two powers, but at the end of the war of succession between Portugal and Castile, the wide-ranging Treaty of Alcaçovas ended Lisbon’s claims to the Fortunate Islands.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-History.txt
Laguna de Medina Across the Guadalquivir and just about 10 km (6 miles) east of Jerez de la Frontera is this small lake, one of the last stops in Europe for birds migrating south from northern and central Europe to Africa at the end of August. In periods of drought it is attractive to birds that usually reside at Doñana, and around 50 species have been observed here.<n>Grazalema A short distance to the east of Laguna de Medina is the mainly mountain wilderness of the natural park of Grazalema. Its 51,695 hectares (127,740 acres) are home to three species of eagles and numerous other birds, mammals, and reptiles. Interestingly, the mountains here, which range between 1,000 and 1,700 meters (3,300 and 5,600 ft), are the first stop for clouds arriving from the Atlantic, giving the area the greatest annual rainfall in Spain. This allows a fine array of flora to thrive. Of particular note is the rare abies pinsapo (Spanish fir tree).<n>El Torcal de Antequera and the Fuente de Piedra Just south of the city of Antequera is one of the more famous geological formations in Spain. The limestone mountains of the El Torcal de Antequera have eroded to form some of the most unusual shapes seen anywhere. In fact, these formations so resemble modern sculptures that they have been assigned comical names. Just north of Antequera, droughts notwithstanding, is the Fuente de Piedra, Andalucía’s largest lake, with a surface area that can reach 1,384 hectares (3,420 acres). Each spring, provided that weather conditions are favorable, it becomes a home to flamingos. In fact, it is the only inland breeding area in Europe for this colorful species. Springtime means the islet of La Colonia becomes one of the most crowded bird habitats anywhere (more than 16,000 breeding pairs were identified in 1996). Over 150 species of birds have been counted on the lake or in surrounding areas.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Nuevo Vallarta is found to the north of the Puerto Vallarta international airport, and is actually located in a different state, Nayarit. A planned community, it has evolved into a sister destination of Puerto Vallarta, with ultra-modern hotels, many of them all-inclusive, dominating the wide, beautiful, stretch of beach. This area has a secluded sense of privacy; however, to date, it offers little in the way of dining, shopping, or nightlife outside the hotels. A new festival shopping center, slated to open in the summer of 2000, should increase these options, and transportation into Puerto Vallarta — about 30 minutes by taxi — is readily available. Nuevo Vallarta is also the place to kayak a lagoon or swim with dolphins.<n>Located just north of downtown, Marina Vallarta is the site of modern hotels and wide beaches. It is a resort within a resort, with a championship golf course, ample tennis facilities, and an exclusive marina filled with yachts, sailing vessels, and charter boats. Surrounding the marina are numerous boutiques, restaurants, and travel agencies, plus all types of services to accommodate arriving cruisers. Condominiums, many available for vacation rental, surround the marina as well. This fashionable neighborhood is a favorite with families, and offers the best array of activities and entertainment for the younger traveler — including a water park and mammoth video arcade and entertainment center. Since this development sits on a swampy area that has been filled in, the beaches in Marina Vallarta are less attractive than those in other areas of town, and are occasionally very rocky. The grand hotels make up for this with their dazzling pools, but anyone whose heart is set on true “beach time” should consider another option.<n>Vallarta’s original hotels were constructed along the stretch of wide, soft sandy strand that extends from the airport into the central downtown area. Along the Hotel Zone, there’s an ample mix of excellent hotels, and this area is also a great place for recreational watersports and convenient to Vallarta’s many treasures. This is also the section of town where the Terminal Marítima (Marine Terminal) is located, docking point for cruise ships as well as the numerous excursion boats.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt
