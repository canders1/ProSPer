this trial all of the sudden isn't addressed as to intelligent<n>design, but rather the media is going to be very much concerned in<n>terms as to these stringers, not full-time employees, not employees at<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
what they want. I clearly will not get what I want, because at the<n>end of the day, if I agree that my reporters are going to testify<n>predicated upon something that I want to propose here, that's more<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
sense that it came, as I said, on the eve of trial, when we knew<n>that there was going to be an issue with respect to their testimony<n>at trial. It was an attempt to bring this to a head. It was<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
don't want to testify, then we'll go on the record -- now, I'm not<n>going to put them on the witness stand. I don't think it's necessary<n>to do that. I would bring you and the reporters, I will tell you,<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
to the bar. I will swear them in, I will have them sworn in. I<n>will ask you the question whether they're going to testify. I will<n>allow them to speak for themselves on that point, and then we'll<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt

your most current order and because you took out the issues of<n>biases and things of that nature and because we're going to be<n>called to trial by Eric, that maybe he should be speaking to Pat to<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
with respect to --<n>I'm not going to allow that question.<n>But you weren't at the deposition, meaning you don't know<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
I thought, when I heard that the reporters, quite frankly, appeared<n>for depositions, that when I was on a break, I was going to hear<n>an accumulated list of questions that were objected to and that I<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
whatever, well, this isn't a jury trial. You're trying this case.<n>You're either going to believe the reporters or you're going to<n>believe Mr. Buckingham or Mr. Bonsell or whomever when they say, I<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
I have a plane flight.<n>I was not going to be here.<n>Do we need the whole team?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Do we need the whole team?<n>I was the one going to take the deposition.<n>Yeah, Ed was there yesterday.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
of the matter asserted, would be misrepresentative.<n>Well, that's what I'm not going to get into. And I<n>understand and I respect that argument. But I think I've got to<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
on a very slippery slope. It really almost precipitates a bias line<n>of questioning, and I'm not going to allow it. I am trying to<n>narrowly draw this.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
the time constraints on me, but we'll issue it forthwith, and it<n>will indicate that you're going to -- they're going to sit for<n>depositions under those circumstances.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
spelled that out in detail in the prior orders.<n>We are going to simply have them testify for the purpose of<n>authenticating the contents of that article, nothing more, nothing<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
That's an interesting question. I mean, if we're not called<n>today, which we're not going to be, I don't know that it really is<n>an issue. We just had dialogue in chambers, the judge is going to<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt

Well, I don't know about that. I think you can assume,<n>unless you doubt my word, I'm going to issue an order -- and I'm<n>very serious -- I'm going to issue an order and that order will be<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt

satisfactory to you, I will indicate that we are satisfied with the<n>prospective order that we understand the Court is going to enter and<n>that our clients will be testifying at deposition and at trial.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
hear the statement as reported. If it was taken out of context,<n>we're not going to delve into that in this examination. The<n>individual who believes -- who was quoted and believes the statement<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt

Your Honor, one thing I might ask, since it is perhaps<n>likely that issues are going to arise during the deposition, I'm<n>wondering if we could now attempt to schedule the deposition at a<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
I cannot do it Monday because I couldn't get here on<n>Sunday. My wife is going out of town, and I have to watch all the<n>kids. I could do it Tuesday, I could do it Wednesday.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
And what did you learn?<n>That they were going to have Of Pandas and People in the classroom as a supplemental text to the biology book.<n>And did you learn about where that book was going to come from?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
That they were going to have Of Pandas and People in the classroom as a supplemental text to the biology book.<n>And did you learn about where that book was going to come from?<n>It was donated.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
And approximately when was that?<n>In October, I believe it was, in '04. It was in the newspaper that they were going to be teaching their intelligent design from Of Pandas and People.<n>And did you attend that board meeting?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
And did you learn anything else from reading the newspapers at that time?<n>Well, that they were going to read the statement in the classroom, yes.<n>Okay. Now, I'd like to ask you to take a look in the notebook at what's been marked as P127.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Can you tell us what it is?<n>It's the newsletter that came to the house in the mail that told -- that had the statement included that they were going to be teaching in the biology class.<n>Now, do you know approximately when you received this?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
And can you tell us what harm you believe that it has caused you?<n>Late in '04 my daughter came home from school, and I was discussing kind of what was going on in the district with her. And she looked at me and she said, Well, Mom, evolution is a lie, what kind of Christian are you, anyway, which I found to be very upsetting.<n>Did you ask her why she said that?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Did you ask her why she said that?<n>Yeah, I asked her why she said that, and she said in school what they had been talking about or amongst her friends and what's going on. She seemed to be under the impression that as a Christian, she could not believe that evolution was a science that, you know, was true.<n>And how did that harm you?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
I didn't ask you that question. I asked you, in 2003, did you attend a board meeting?<n>I'm going to say I don't remember which board meetings I attended.<n>In --<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Is it true that you did not attend a board meeting in the year 2003?<n>I'm not going to say that's not true. I don't remember which board meetings I attended. I did attend some before '04.<n>Is it true that you didn't attend a board meeting in 2002?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
I don't remember.<n>Mrs. Smith, I'm going to hand you --<n>Your Honor, may I<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
BY MR. THOMPSON<n>Mrs. Smith, I'm going to hand you what purports to be your deposition that was taken by Patrick Gillen. I would like you to direct your attention to Page 13, and I would like you to read out loud the question that you are asked starting with Line 18 and all the way down through that page and then going on to the next page, Page 14, and reading from Line 1 through Line 4. And please read it out loud.<n>You want me to read out loud starting on 18?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Now, wait. She's not<n>going to answer it until I rule on the objection. Elaborate on your<n>objection.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
"This newsletter has been produced to help explain the changes in the biology curriculum. Unfortunately, a great deal of misinformation has been spread regarding this policy. We hope this publication will help those interested better understand the substance of the policy while eliminating any misconceptions some may have about the curriculum change. We sincerely appreciate your understanding on this matter."<n>Thank you. It was through this policy that you first learned about the statement that was going to be read. Is that correct?<n>No, I believe -- no, I heard about it before.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
I don't think so.<n>So this was the first time that you saw the statement that was going to be read to the students in the ninth-grade biology class. Is that correct?<n>I believe so.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
As far as I can tell.<n>And so this newsletter was actually providing information to the residents of Dover as to what the actual newsletter was -- excuse me, what the actual statement was going to say. Is that correct?<n>Yes.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
it's common sense.<n>Now I think we're going afield. I'll sustain the<n>objection. We're now clearly outside the scope of direct, the<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Rehm testified that they had reached a compromise with some of the<n>board members that they were going to allow the book Of Pandas and<n>People in the science classroom.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Do you recall any other board members saying anything during the course of any discussion about the biology textbook?<n>Well, like I said, I was reentering the room from the bathroom, so I was sort of in the doorway. And I obviously didn't know what Max had said to the board but that he had spoken to the board. So the comments that were coming back were, I assume, directed at him. But there were comments from Bill Buckingham about brainwashing, and I remember hearing that, the whole thing about brainwashing, because it dealt with going to college and getting this education and students who go to college become brainwashed. And I was very upset by that because I attended college and I don't feel as if I were brainwashed. And also I recall Alan Bonsell making a comment about, you know, there are only two theories, there's this theory evolution and there's this theory creation, and if you're teaching only those two theories, then there's not a problem.<n>Do you recall anything else Mr. Bonsell said?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Yes, I do recall Bill Buckingham making comments about, you know, the apes and monkeys -coming from apes and monkeys. And I also --<n>Your Honor, again, objection. It appears she's going to be<n>reading from the article with her testimony.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
he spoke.<n>My next question was going to<n>be simply if you could tell us what -- but I think she's already<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
To my students taking a PSSA test, well, you know, I -- being an educator, I'm not in love with PSSA tests or standardized tests. But if you're asking me if I object to my daughter taking a standardized test with that information on it, of course not. I would hope that they would provide lots of academic information on those tests.<n>And is it your understanding that because Dover is a standards-driven district, that they're going to focus their class time on preparing students to achieve proficiency on those standard-based assessments?<n>I'm sorry, can you repeat that?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
I'm sorry, can you repeat that?<n>Yes. Is it your understanding that because Dover is a standard-based district, the class instruction is going to focus on preparing students to achieve proficiency on those standard-based tests that we were just describing?<n>Not only is that my understanding, but that is what I would expect.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Is it your understanding that some of these additional books that were put in the library are actually critical of intelligent design?<n>Actually, I am, because I recall them -- an organization actually sending the library those books, because there was controversy in those books being put in there, too. And there were many members of the community who had called to see whether those books had actually gotten there or not, into the library, because we weren't certain that those books were going to be allowed in the library, permitted in the library.<n>They're in the library?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
And what are those plans?<n>To continue keeping them, you know, going through the Dover School District.<n>And do you work outside the home?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
It looks to me to be a copy of a letter to the editor that I wrote.<n>And I'm going to ask you to read this letter into the record.<n>Okay.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Why is it hearsay?<n>She's going to be reading in the letter, the contents of<n>the statement. It's an out-of-court statement. They're obviously<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Please read the letter.<n>"This letter is in regard to the comments made by Beth Eveland from York Township in the June York Sunday News. I assure you that the Dover Area School Board is not going against its mission statement. In fact, if you read the statement, it says to educate our students so that they can be contributing members of society. "I do not believe in teaching revisionist history. Our country was founded on Christian beliefs and principles. We are not looking for a book that is teaching students that this is a wrong thing or a right thing. It is just a fact. All we are trying to accomplish with this task is to choose a biology book that teaches the most prevalent theories. "The definition of 'theory' is merely a speculative or an ideal circumstance. To present only one theory or to give one option would be directly contradicting our mission statement. You can teach creationism without it being Christianity. It can be presented as a higher power. That is where another part of Dover's mission statement comes into play. That part would be in partnership with family and community. You as a parent can teach your child your family's ideology."<n>And what was your reaction to that letter when you read it in the paper, Mrs. Eveland?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
No, I don't.<n>I want to get a sense for what your understanding is of what is going on in the ninth-grade biology class that your daughter will be attending several years from now. Is it your understanding that Darwin's theory of evolution is going to be taught pursuant to the state academic standards?<n>It is my understanding, yes.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
With regard to the biology book for the ninth-grade class.<n>It's my understanding that they held off on the vote in June because there was a new edition that was going to come out. And they wanted to get the most current book instead of wasting money on an older book.<n>And so they ended up purchasing the version?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
That's correct.<n>And you told him that you didn't think that was going to happen?<n>I told him that I would just sit back and wait and see what happened.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Ma'am, I'm handing you what is your deposition testimony that you gave on March 28th of 2005. And I'd like you to read, if you look on Page 64, read from Line 18 through 25, and then we'll continue on the next page once you finish that.<n>"The first board meeting I attended in July he approached me before the meeting started and asked if I had read the -- if I was familiar with the comments that were quoted in the paper. I told him just simply what I had read. "He asked me what I thought about it, and I said, The comments, I don't feel that is appropriate. He asked me if I asked for Mr. Buckingham's resignation on the spot. I told him I didn't think that that was going to happen."<n>And the next line, Line 3, is a question which states, "When Mr. Maldonado asked you that question, do you have a sense for why?" Could you plead read your answer, which is Lines 5 through 8.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
No, I did not.<n>Ma'am, do you understand that the statement that's going to be read to the students in the ninth-grade biology class was modified in June of 2005?<n>Yes, I do.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
do so by admitting the exhibits that we need to, if we need to.<n>P46 is the York Daily Record article. I assume we're going to<n>withhold admitting that pending further proceedings. Is that right, Mr.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Yeah, I do too.<n>So you guys need to start going to the E_D_U meetings.<n>I see.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bmr021.txt

And it's conceivable I mean, I - I don't - I mean, so um, I was told that it's  possible  that that might have, uh, caused additional wear on it. Maybe caused it to - to go bad sooner.<n>Well, I think there was something else going on, because uh Dave Johnson said that D_D was getting accessed  frequently.  And it  shouldn't  be.<n>Hmm.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bmr021.txt

And also at this theater, they gave prizes to different people.<n>And one of the way they gave prizes was, they would take big group photos and everybody, and there were stairs going up to a balcony, real wide stairs.<n>And the big group of people would go stand on the stairs and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And of course there's nothing to do with a box of ice cream sandwiches when you're at a 2-hour movie!<n>They're going to melt!<n>And another, um, that was in, that was in High Point, NC.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
-a nickel worth of scraps!<n>And we didn't even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movie.<n>And what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking, mistakes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And when I was young, it wasn't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie.<n>I mean, my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back, but today you wouldn't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother; you just wouldn't do it.<n>And we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie and we would do that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
We just did what we could get away with.<n>Anyway, that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre, and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it's kind of a, pretty much of a spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time.<n>So we bought our tickets and we went into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat, file, all filed in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And that's really all I remember about that night, it was just a lot of fun.<n>And I really hope that my daughters have had some nights like that and has had good times like that, that I can remember going out with good friends.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt

i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything<n>but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them<n>um-hum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2015-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago<n>and um gosh it was about nine o'clock at night too it wasn't even what i would consider you know a family hour it's time to you know start going to bed and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints<n>and uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i don't particularly care for it so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2015-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah yeah no i i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then that's fine with me too you know as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in and and i don't like the way that they do it either<n>and and it's their mission as they do as they go door-to-door and they go out into the public and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work<n>and i don't know i just um i just don't particularly care for that at all and that that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2015-ms98-a-trans.txt
Let's welcome the candidates, Governor Bush and Vice President Gore. Good evening, from Wake Chapel at Wake Forest University at Winston-Salem, North Carolina. I'm Jim Lehrer of the News Hour on PBS. Welcome to this second election 2000 debate between the Republican candidate for president, George W. Bush of Texas, and the Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The format and the rules are those negotiated by representatives of the two campaigns. Only the subjects tonight and the questions are mine. The format tonight is that of a conversation. The only prevailing rule is that no single response can ever, ever exceed two minutes. The prevailing rule for the audience here in the hall is as always, absolute quiet, please. Good evening, Governor Bush, Vice President Gore. The end of our 90 minutes last week in Boston, the total time each of you took was virtually the same. Let's see if we can do the same tonight, or come close. Governor Bush, the first question goes to you. One of you is about to be elected the leader of the single-most powerful nation in the world, economically, financially, militarily, diplomatically, you name it. Have you formed any guiding principles for exercising this enormous power?<n>I have, I have. First question is what's in the best interests of the United States? What's in the best interests of our people? When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question. Is it in our nation's interests? Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests. Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests. Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest. I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president. I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy. I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night. He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him. He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side. One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people. I've been able to set clear goals. The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals. That's what a Chief Executive Officer does. So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.<n>Vice President Gore?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Let's go through some of the specifics now. New question. Vice President Gore, the governor mentioned the Middle East. Here we're talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have. What do you think the United States should do right now to resolve that conflict over there?<n>The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there. We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured. We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on. I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there. The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now. It's a very tense situation there. But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there. It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue. Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there. And we just have to take it day-to-day right now. But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing. Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives. They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring. And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.<n>Governor?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Governor?<n>Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions. Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East. I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend. I'm going to stand by Israel. Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship. And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein. The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way. The sanctions are being violated. We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president. But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resoluting your determination. One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace is to be able to say to the Saddam Husseins of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends. It's also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we're now in. After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing. I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.<n>So you don't believe, Vice President Gore, that we should take sides and resolve this right now? A lot of people pushing hey, the United States should declare itself and not be so neutral in this particular situation.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
You agree with that, Governor?<n>I do. I do think this, though. When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place. It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis. Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides. And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense. This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table. I will try to do the same thing. But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.<n>People watching here tonight are very interested in Middle East policy, and they are so interested they want to base their vote on differences between the two of you as president how you would handle Middle East policy. Is there any difference?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Saddam Hussein, you mean, get him out of there?<n>I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well. We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be. He is a danger. We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East. And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.<n>You feel that is a failure of the Clinton administration?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
But you think it would not have happened -- do you think that Milosevic would not have fallen if the United States and NATO had not intervened militarily? Is this a legitimate use of our military power?<n>Yes, I think it is. Absolutely. I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force. And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment. I supported the president. I thought he made the right decision to do so. I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked. The administration deserves credit for having made it work. It is important for NATO to have it work. It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe. And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future. Now, there's more work to do. Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there's going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one. Also on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans. I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.<n>Well, I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years. When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic. He caused the death of so many people. He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator. And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics. Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indicted war criminal. He should be held accountable. Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor. In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops. Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved. But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values. Now, have I got that wrong?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt

Now, have I got that wrong?<n>Trying to figure out who the questioner was.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Vice President Gore, do you agree with the governor's views on nation building, the use of military, our military, for nation building as he described and defined it?<n>I don't think we agree on that. I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas. I think we have to be very reticent about that. But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly. The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together. Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world. All these other countries are looking to us. Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere. Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II. During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there. We still have lots of troops in Europe. And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's? We were nation building. And it was economic. But it was also military. And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there. We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.<n>You said in the Boston debate, Governor, on this issue of nation building, that the United States military is overextended now. Where is it overextended? Where are there U.S. military that you would bring home if you become president?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
The use of the military, there -- some people are now suggesting that if you don't want to use the military to maintain the peace, to do the civil thing, is it time to consider a civil force of some kind that comes in after the military that builds nations or all of that? Is that on your radar screen?<n>I don't think so. I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations. Maybe I'm missing something here. I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America? Absolutely not. Our military is meant to fight and win war. That's what it's meant to do. And when it gets overextended, morale drops. I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability. And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military. It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.<n>I don't disagree with that. I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete. That's what we did in Haiti. There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now. And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy. That's really about all we can do. But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there. And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose. And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended. I certainly agree with that. And that's why I've supported building up our capacity. I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed. I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does. We've had some disagreements about that. He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say. But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength. And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Do you think we're meeting our obligations properly?<n>No, I would make some changes. I think there need to be reforms in the IMF. I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable. And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF. The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. The governor mentioned it earlier. I've worked on this issue. It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it. And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it. I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history. The world has come together, as I said, they're looking to us. And we have a fundamental choice to make. Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader. And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years. I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus. It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.<n>Let me comment on that. I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be. We can help. And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government. I want to empower the people. I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, we do it this way, so should you. I think we can help. I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. But take Russia, for example. We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. They're going to have to make the decision themselves. Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make. So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, we do it this way, so should you. Now, we trust freedom. We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans. But maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt

First, a couple of follow-ups from the vice presidential debate last week. Vice President Gore, would you support or sign, as president, a federal law banning racial profiling by police and other authorities at all levels of government?<n>Yes, I would. The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing. I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem. I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there. And I know it's been going on a long time. In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years. But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way. And I was surprised at the extent of it. And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this. Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity. Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core. And it's not an easy problem to solve. But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.<n>Yeah, I can't imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed. That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about. And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling. One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces. I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs decisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job. I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level. But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced. I don't think they ought to be held guilty. But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done. And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
On hate crimes laws?<n>No. We've got one in Texas. And guess what? The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them? They're going to be put to death. A jury found them guilty. It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death. And it's the right cause. It's the right decision. Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America. Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence. People are stopped, and we have to do something about that. My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect. So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces. It's an issue throughout our society. And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more. I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care. They're tolerant people. They're good, tolerant people. It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them.<n>What -- if you become president, Governor, are there other areas, racial problem areas, that you would deal with as president involving discrimination? Like you said, Arab-Americans, but also Hispanics, Asians, as well as Blacks in this country.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Would you support a national hate crimes law?<n>I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version. But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books. That bill did -- there was another bill that did die in committee. But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime. And we're going to make sure people get punished for the crime. And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to deaths. And that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas.<n>New subject, new question. Another vice presidential debate follow-up. Governor, both Senator Lieberman and Secretary Cheney said they were sympathetically rethinking their views on same sex relationships. What's your position on that?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
New subject, new question. Another vice presidential debate follow-up. Governor, both Senator Lieberman and Secretary Cheney said they were sympathetically rethinking their views on same sex relationships. What's your position on that?<n>I'm not for gay marriage. I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman. And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act. I presume the Vice President supported it when the President signed that bill and supports it now. But I think marriage is a sacred institution. I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me. I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas. I've been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other people's points of view. But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman.<n>Vice President Gore?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Well, but it's a logical response.<n>Well, I have no idea. I mean, he can throw out all kinds -- I don't know the particulars of this law. I will tell you I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation. As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further. I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life. And I think that's a private matter. And I think that's the way it ought to be. But I'm going to be respectful for people, I'll tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people.<n>Special rights, how does that affect gays and lesbians?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Governor?<n>Well, it starts with enforcing law. When you say loud and clear to somebody if you're going to carry a gun illegally, we're going to arrest you. If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested. If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law. And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. And I'm going to make it a priority. Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them. That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows. One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. In Texas I tried to do something innovative. There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. I support that. But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free. So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free. I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. I disagree with the vice president on this issue. He is for registration of guns. I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens. The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D. card. It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that. An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.<n>All right. So on guns, somebody wants to cast a vote based on your differences, where are the differences?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
All right. Who would issue the --<n>The state. The state. I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns. There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records. And the "Los Angeles Times" spent a lot of ink going into that. But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns. I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now. Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people. The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns.

What are they, Governor, from your point of view, between you and the Vice President?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Back to the question about the differences on gun control. What are they, Governor, from your point of view, between you and the Vice President?<n>Well, I'm not for photo licensing. Let me say something about Columbine. Listen, we've got gun laws. He says we ought to have gun-free schools. Everybody believes that. I'm sure every state in the union has got them. You can't carry a gun into a school. And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school. But Columbine spoke to a larger issue. It's really a matter of culture. It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life. Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life? So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs. Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you. So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong. And we can enforce law. But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law. But there's a larger law. Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.<n>I also believe in the Golden Rule. And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said. We do have a serious problem in our culture. Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children. She's worked on it longer than I have. But I feel very strongly about that. And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that. But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting. But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns. I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt

Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun. What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence. So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws. We added beds. We're tough. We believe in tough love. We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained. And that's what needs to happen. We've got laws. If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important.<n>New question. As I was saying. Both of you -- Governor, both of you have talked much about Medicare and health care for seniors. What about the more than 40 million younger Americans who do not have health insurance right now? What would you do about that?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Let's let the governor respond to that. Are those numbers correct? Are his charges correct?<n>If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong. We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people. And they get health care. Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care. But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased. He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population. And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd. Let me just tell you who the jury is. The people of Texas. There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me. And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person. So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around. I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right. We come together both Republicans and Democrats.<n>Let me put that directly to you, Vice President Gore. The reason you brought this up, is it -- are you suggesting that those numbers and that record will reflect the way Governor Bush will operate in this area of health insurance as president?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
What is not true, Governor?<n>That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending. The top -- let's talk about my tax plan. The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes. And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief. We just have a different point of view. It's a totally different point of view. He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute. We pay 4.7 billion. I can't emphasize to you how much. I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place. The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session. We're working hard to sign up children. We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state. We're making really good progress. And our state cares a lot about our children. My priority is going to be the health of our citizens. These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured. They have not done it. They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare. And they have not got it done. And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse. The horse is up there now. But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for American.<n>New question, new subject. Vice President Gore, on the environment. In your 1992 book you said, quote, "We must make the rescue of our environment the central organizing principle for civilization and there must be a wrenching transformation to save the planet." Do you still feel that way?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Explain what a brown field is to those who don't follow this.<n>A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers. And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit. I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met. The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment. And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now. I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality. I think we need to have clean coal technologies. I propose $2 billion worth. By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area. And it was a smart move because there's gas reserves up there. We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down. Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that's what we did in Texas. No excuses. You must conform. In other words, there are practical things we can do. But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks. If you own the land, every day is Earth Day. People care a lot about their land and care about their environment. Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue.<n>Where do you see the basic difference in very simple terms in two or three sentences between you and the governor on the environment? If a voter wants to make a choice, what is it?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
What about global warming?<n>I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously. But I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet. And I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions. I tell you one thing I'm not going to do is I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air. Like Kyoto Treaty would have done. China and India were exempted from that treaty. I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.<n>Global warming, the Senate did turn it down. I think --<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
99 to nothing.<n>Well, that vote wasn't exactly -- a lot of the supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded. But there's no doubt there's a lot of opposition to it in the Senate. I'm not for command and control techniques either. I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with. But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming. I think that we do. It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this. Look, the world's temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable. What are we going to tell our children? I'm a grandfather now. I want to be able to tell my grandson when I'm in my later years that I didn't turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm. In my faith tradition, it is -- it's written in the book of Matthew, "Where your heart is, there is your treasure also." And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.<n>Yeah, I agree. I just -- I think there has been -- some of the scientists, I believe, Mr. Vice President, haven't they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming? A profound scientist recently made a different --<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
New question. Last question. For you, Governor. And this flows somewhat out of the Boston debate. You, your running mate, your campaign officials have charged that Vice President Gore exaggerates, embellishes and stretches the facts, etcetera. Are you -- do you believe these are serious issues? This is a serious issue that the voters should use in deciding which one of you two men to vote for on November 7?<n>Well, we all make mistakes. I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself, you know, if you know what I mean. I think credibility is important. It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations. And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider. This isn't something new. I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims. I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley saying he authored the EITC when it didn't happen. I mention the last debate --<n>EITC?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
That's all right.<n>A lot of initials from a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it? Anyway, he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didn't. And so I think this is an issue. I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package. I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers. But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue. And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations. Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package. That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case. And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions. That's what debates are about and that's what campaigns are about.<n>Vice President Gore?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Vice President Gore?<n>I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that. And I'm going to try to do better. One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make. However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that. There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes. More sometimes than people in foreign countries. And we need to do something about that. Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over. But right away. And that means doing it under the Medicare program. I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong. I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard. But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.<n>Does that resolve the issue, Governor?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Does that resolve the issue, Governor?<n>That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?<n>Does it resolve it for you?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Governor Bush, two minutes.<n>Jim, thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, thank you very much, and I would like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest, and I want to thank you all for listening. I'm running to get some things done for America. There's too many issues left unresolved. There's been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C. I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future. I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability. No child should be left behind in America. I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace. I worry about morale in today's military. The warning signs are clear. It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they're housed better and have a focused mission for our military. Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare. This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue. It's time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage. I want to do something about Social Security. It's an important priority, because now is the time to act and we're going to say to our seniors, our promises we've made to you will be promises kept. But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money. And finally, I do believe in tax relief. I believe we can set our priorities. I don't believe, like the vice president does, in huge government. I believe in limited government. By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills. I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can. Thank you for listening. I'm asking for your vote, and God bless.<n>And we will return next Tuesday night, October 17th, from Washington University in St. Louis for the third and final debate.

Children across our country don't have health care. We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.<n>I have a plan to cover all Americans.

We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.<n>Mr. President, would you like to add something?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt

All right.<n>Senator Kerry, a new question. Let's talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health-care costs, as you are talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war.<n>My question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.<n>During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules.

He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1. 6 million jobs lost.

And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they're self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees.<n>Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. It works. And I'm going to offer it to America.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt

In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind. Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report. The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated. They analyzed the senator's plan. It cost $1.2 trillion.<n>The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care. It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.<n>If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees. Why should they insure somebody when the government's going to insure it for them?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt

We're expanding veterans' health care throughout the country. We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now. Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next four years.<n>Mr. President, the next question is to you. We all know that Social Security is running out of money, and it has to be fixed. You have proposed to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts. But the critics are saying that's going to mean finding $1 trillion over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up.<n>So where do you get the money? Are you going to have to increase the deficit by that much over 10 years?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt

But the critics are saying that's going to mean finding $1 trillion over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up.<n>So where do you get the money? Are you going to have to increase the deficit by that much over 10 years?<n>First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren. I will work with Republicans and Democrats. It'll be a vital issue in my second term. It is an issue that I am willing to take on, and so I'll bring Republicans and Democrats together.<n>And we're of course going to have to consider the costs. But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.<n>Senator Kerry?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility. In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats -- broke with my party. We balanced the budget in the '90s. We paid down the debt for two years.<n>And that's what we're going to do. We're going to protect Social Security. I will not privatize it. I will not cut the benefits. And we're going to be fiscally responsible. And we will take care of Social Security.<n>Let me just stay on Social Security with a new question for Senator Kerry, because, Senator Kerry, you have just said you will not cut benefits.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, says there's no way that Social Security can pay retirees what we have promised them unless we recalibrate.<n>What he's suggesting, we're going to cut benefits or we're going to have to raise the retirement age. We may have to take some other reform. But if you've just said, you've promised no changes, does that mean you're just going to leave this as a problem, another problem for our children to solve?<n>Not at all. Absolutely not, Bob. This is the same thing we heard -- remember, I appeared on "Meet the Press" with Tim Russert in 1990-something. We heard the same thing. We fixed it.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut. Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut. I don't. I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year.<n>And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country.<n>Now, we can do that.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has.<n>I have a plan to put America back to work. And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.<n>Mr. President?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
And we'll continue to do so over the next four years. It's a subject I'm very familiar with. After all, I was a border governor for a while.<n>Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons. They're coming here to work. If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5. 15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families. And that's what's happening.<n>And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families. See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.<n>It also means it takes pressure off the border. If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border. It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job.<n>Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty. I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior. There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen. And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11. The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will.<n>Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it's all we have, it's not going to solve the problem.<n>The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring. It's against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.<n>I'll answer it straight to America. I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution. And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right.<n>So I don't intend to see it undone.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces.<n>Our military is overextended. Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq. One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.<n>Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support.<n>In addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve. And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country. There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security. We ought to be doing that. And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure.<n>But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing. We'll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year.<n>I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia. Some of them had been there before.<n>The people I talked to their spirits were high. They didn't view their service as a back-door draft. They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
You said that if Congress would vote to extend the ban on assault weapons, that you'd sign the legislation, but you did nothing to encourage the Congress to extend it. Why not?<n>Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear. I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties. I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun. I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.<n>But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
So I believe America's less safe.<n>If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, "Sorry, we don't have the votes," I'd have said, "Then we're going to have a fight. "<n>And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen. We'd have won what Bill Clinton won.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Now, let me just share something. This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP. This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus. This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.<n>If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers? I see that as part of my job as president, and I'll make my best effort to do it.<n>Mr. President?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college?<n>That's the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma.<n>I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.<n>And one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America.<n>Mr. President?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
My fellow Americans, as you heard from Bob Schieffer a moment ago, America is being tested by division. More than ever, we need to be united as a country.<n>And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea. I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger.<n>These are dangerous times. I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world. And I believe that we can together do things that are within the grasp of Americans.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Just anything to get out of doing my job.<n>So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow, do what she tell told me to do, she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family.<n>So she began to tell this story.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt

Yes, my brother went to school.<n>He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C.

Smith, here in Charlotte.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
I think that was the last class I took.<n>My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school.<n>But you would have been able to be a, a teacher if you had continued?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband.<n>After all of this was, after I, I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of going back to school.<n>I just got to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never went back.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
