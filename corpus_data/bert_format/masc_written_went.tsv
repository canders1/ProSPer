"That's great! What was the name of that clinic?" [SEP] Fred	went	blank. [SEP] He thought and thought but couldn't remember.

Questions A veterinarian was feeling ill and	went	to see her doctor. [SEP] The doctor asked her all the usual questions, about symptoms, how long had they been occurring, etc., when she interrupted him, "I'm a veterinarian and I don't need to ask my patients these kind of questions. I can tell what's wrong just by looking." [SEP] She smugly added, "Why can't you?" [SEP] The doctor nodded, stood back, and looked her up and down. [SEP] He then quickly wrote out a prescription, handed it to her and said, "There you are. Of course, if that doesn't work, then we'll just have to have you put to sleep."	#jokes#	jokes_jokes11.txt	go	written	masc_written	3

This 85 year old couple, having been married almost 60 years, had died in a car crash. [SEP] They had been in good health the last ten years, mainly due to her interest in health food and exercise. [SEP] When they reached the pearly gates, St. Peter took them to their mansion which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen and master bath suite and Jacuzzi. [SEP] As they "oohed and aahed" the old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost. [SEP] "It's free," Peter replied, "this is Heaven." [SEP] Next they	went	out back to survey the championship golf course that the home backed up to. [SEP] They would have golfing privileges everyday and each week the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. [SEP] The old man asked, "What are the green fees?"

[SEP] With that the old man	went	into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it and shrieking wildly. [SEP] Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down, asking him what was wrong.

A young cook decided that the French would enjoy feasting on rabbits and decided to raise rabbits in Paris and sell them to the finer restaurants in the city. [SEP] He searched all over Paris seeking a suitable place to raise his rabbits. [SEP] None could be found. [SEP] Finally, an old priest at the cathedral said he could have a small area behind the rectory for his rabbits. [SEP] He successfully raised a number of them, and when he	went	about Paris selling them, a restaurant owner asked him where he got such fresh rabbits. [SEP] The young man replied, "I raise them myself, near the cathedral. In fact, I have ... a hutch back of Notre Dame."	#jokes#	jokes_jokes16.txt	go	written	masc_written	3

[SEP] After a considerable amount of sniffing, The Retriever sadly shook its head and barked.

Going Down There were these two guys out hiking when they came upon an old, abandoned mineshaft.

[SEP] Still nothing. [SEP] They searched the area for something larger and came upon a railroad tie. [SEP] With great difficulty, the two men carried it to the opening and threw it in. [SEP] While waiting for it to hit bottom, a goat suddenly darted between them and leapt into the hole! [SEP] The guys were still standing there with astonished looks upon their faces from the actions of the goat when a man walked up to them.

[SEP] The contrast between working for McDonalds for six months or working for McDonalds for a lifetime is, writ large, the contrast between boundaryless careers and their traditional bounded counterparts.
