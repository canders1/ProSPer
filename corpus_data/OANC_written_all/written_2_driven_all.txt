As one consequence, the number of business failures among U.S. apparel manufacturers climbed from 227 in 1975 to a high of 567 in 1993.14 Not surprisingly, employment in the apparel sector during this period declined appreciably. And the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a further reduction in the domestic apparel industry during the period 1996 to 2006 from 864,000 workers to just 714,00015—this from an industry that employed about 1.2 million employees in 1950 and reached a peak of 1.4 million employees in 1973.16<n>The conventional wisdom explains the industry’s decline in this way: Apparel, particularly women’s apparel, is driven by price-based competition among generally small manufacturing and contracting establishments.17 Labor costs represent a significant portion of cost for many garment categories,18 and U.S. wage levels far exceed those of competitors in countries like the People’s Republic of China and Mexico.19 Although the magnitude of these differences varies as exchange rates fluctuate, under any realistic exchange-rate scenario, the labor cost differential is sufficiently high to put U.S. manufacturers at a very significant competitive disadvantage.<n>The manufacture of men’s shirts provides another illustration. Throughout much of the post-World War II era, the majority of men’s shirts sold in the United States were white dress shirts, primarily through department stores. Shirts with stripes, patterns, and uncommon colors constituted less than 30 percent of all dress shirts sold through the 1960s.20 In this environment, low fashion content and limited product variety made demand for individual shirts relatively predictable. Store buyers succeeded by striking deals with apparel manufacturers for large shipments of white shirts at the lowest possible price and with long delivery lead times. Unlike the women’s industry, where style has always mattered more, relatively large men’s apparel manufacturers such as Haggar; Hart, Schaffner, and Marx; Fruit of the Loom; Arrow Shirt Company; and Hathaway Shirt emerged, seeking to capture economies of scale.21<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt
The producer who hesitates to employ new strategies will not likely survive, as expected innovations in technology dramatically alter the nature of clothing manufacture. Garment-making in its current labor-intensive form will eventually be phased out in favor of automated, robotized manufacturing, geared for almost instantaneous transition from one style to another. The difficulty of handling cut fabrics by machines may be resolved in the near future, and the quest for higher operating speeds will then receive more attention, taking production levels to new heights.29<n>Yet here the conventional wisdom misses other significant measures of performance. Managers in well-integrated channels pay attention to inventory costs, inventory replenishment practices, information reliability, and time to market rather than the traditional direct costs of labor and materials alone. In fact, competitive performance is already being driven less by how a company manages its assembly operations and more by how it manages the logistics of its operations as a whole. Our study shows that an apparel manufacturer can still be successful with a traditionally organized sewing room; a firm with innovative and productive assembly operations, on the other hand, may not be competitively viable if it has not invested in information links with retailers and other changes in management practices.<n>Apparel manufacturers are not the only ones learning this lesson the hard way. The emphasis on labor productivity that has preoccupied practitioners and analysts in many industries—such as the total labor minutes required to assemble a car—no longer makes as much sense now that information technology has revolutionized retailing in many product segments. For instance, the current labor costs associated with assembly constitute 40 percent of the final cost of a car. In contrast, distribution-related costs—those associated with the traditional structure of automobile retailing—constitute anywhere between 15 and 34 percent of final cost.30 It is little wonder that car companies are currently in the throes of radically restructuring their method of automobile distribution.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt
Proposition 4:  Instead of fashion as the saving grace of the channel, basic and fashion-basic products will prove critical to its long-term survival.<n>When people consider the U.S. apparel industry, they often think of New York City’s Seventh Avenue, which is driven by new design, constantly changing seasonal offerings, and a willingness by consumers to pay a premium for the cutting edge of fashion. New York City and Los Angeles continue to have a competitive advantage in this area because a large number of designers and manufacturers are located in these cities and can respond quickly to changing demands, as well as shape them. This infrastructure allows for “quick response” on the fashion end of the women’s and, to a more limited extent, men’s markets. Once established, a variety of proponents believe, the experience at the fashion end can be diffused downward to less fashion-oriented products. As a result, some of the fashion-oriented products that had been sourced offshore can then return to the United States.<n>Those with a pessimistic view of domestic apparel manufacturing often assume that the high fashion end of the industry (the “top” of the fashion triangle in Figure 1.1, page 9) may be its best hope because U.S. firms can capitalize on their proximity to market. The highly acclaimed report by the MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity, Made in America, concludes:<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt
Apparel, textile, and fiber firms and retailers have recently joined to launch the Quick Response Program, designed to improve information flow, standardize recording systems, and improve turnaround time throughout the system.... The program could be an important boon to productivity and competitiveness.... Will Quick Response succeed? According to industry experts, that depends on whether it diffuses down to the high-fashion, quick turnaround segments of the industry or, like much new technology in this industry, is adapted to suit the needs of firms still committed to mass production.31<n>Regardless of where Quick Response has succeeded, however, our research indicates that very different time-based competitive demands have emerged in the industry, driven not by voluntary acceptance of policies but by the changing nature of market competition among retailers. Rather than arising in the fashion, “Seventh Avenue” segment of the industry, the new form of retail competition involves basic and fashion-basic products like jeans, intimate apparel, and T-shirts—the bottom of the fashion triangle.<n>Basic and fashion-basic apparel categories now constitute the lion’s share of industry sales, accounting for approximately 72 percent of all shipments.32 This implies that a far larger portion of the industry may be viable in the long run than the part that could be saved by “quick response” at the fashion end.33 Bear in mind, however, that this viability depends on manufacturers using information to plan and execute production in a more sophisticated manner than usual for this and other industries.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt
Alfred Chandler described the last industrial transformation in his well-known book The Visible Hand. The use of everything from railroads to an improved postal service, according to Chandler, created enterprises with internal administrative structures that coordinated the flow of goods from many individual producers to many more consumers. This administrative coordination reduced “the number of transactions involved in the flow of goods, increased the speed and regularity of that flow, and so lowered costs and improved the productivity of the American distribution system.”4<n>The parallels with the information integration now occurring in retail-apparel-textile channels—this time driven by advances in computer and related technologies—are striking. In fact, another industrial transformation is under way, one that rivals the earlier revolution in organizational structure and management. The first three sections of this chapter summarize the emergence of the U.S. retail, apparel, and textile industries over the past century, including a number of human resource issues. The fourth section looks at their channel relations prior to the mid-1980s, before some enterprises started interacting with each other in new ways. This brief historical survey highlights not only the crucial developments that still undergird these industries but also the systems and work practices from an earlier era that no longer match today’s competitive requirements.<n>Retail: From General Stores to Mass Retailers<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
Primary textile manufacturing includes both the spinning of raw cotton and other fibers into yarn and the weaving of yarn into “greige goods,” or unfinished cloth. Although there have been specialized spinning and weaving mills, the great majority of output is produced in enterprises that engage in both operations. In fact, Lowell and his associates established the first incorporated manufacturing operation when they set up an integrated mill, from cotton to finished fabric.33 The cloth produced in weaving mills requires further finishing—such as bleaching, shrinking, dyeing, and printing—before it is ready for sale to the apparel industry, to retail distributors, or to industrial consumers. To undertake such a comprehensive set of activities, of course, requires significant capital investment. From the outset of the Industrial Revolution, spinning, weaving, and finishing have called for substantial investments in plants, power, and equipment.34<n>Because of this capital intensity, the textile industry has been driven by economies of scale. American plants have largely succeeded through making huge runs of a limited range of products and, since the 1950s, technological changes on the floor—much quieter machinery, for example, or removal of the ubiquitous cotton dust (now required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) that used to affect both worker performance and the quality of cloth—have dramatically improved industry performance. Further, the knitting machine has been a key development in manufacturing technology. Knitted goods are an essential and growing segment of the textile industry, a trend that reflects the increasing demand for casual wear. The knitting machine produces cloth as the loom does but uses a different method. The warp knitting machine produces a flat fabric much like woven cloth, while the circular knitting machine creates a tubular fabric. The most important knit goods products are hosiery, knit underwear, and knit outerwear—popular casual wear items like T-shirts, polo shirts, and sweatpants. Knitting mills now account for almost 30 percent of production employees engaged in textile manufacturing.35<n>Continuing integration of the industry also contributed to the rise in productivity. Although small, family-owned and operated companies were the norm in traditional textiles, in the early 1950s leaders like Burlington Industries and Milliken undertook vertical integration to handle textile products from fiber to finishing.36 Historically, finishing operations were often undertaken by separate firms known as converters, which played a large role in the design of finished goods. Companies like Burlington integrated forward by bringing converting operations in-house, while a number of converters extended their operations backward into primary textiles.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
Sixty years after the opening of Wanamaker’s Philadelphia store, another entrepreneur synthesized a set of existing technologies and, along with a number of other retailers, began another revolution in the industry. Sam Walton started small in the 1970s, but Wal-Mart rapidly became the largest retailer in the United States, with total sales in fiscal year 1995 equaling the combined sales volumes of Kmart, Sears Roebuck and Co., and the supermarket chain The Kroger Co., the next three largest American retail organizations. Walton’s successful innovations placed enormous pressure on other mass merchant retailers to alter their practices along similar lines. By the late 1980s, a growing number of retailers had started changing the way they did business.<n>As we have emphasized, the current retail revolution—involving new information technologies, new product labeling, and new methods of distribution—has driven changes in the apparel and textile industries as well. Yet this revolution didn’t happen overnight; nor was it the brainchild of a single entrepreneur. In fact, the retail systems of both Wanamaker and Walton integrated a variety of innovations that had already been pioneered by other retailers. For example, Wanamaker’s “one-price” policy was initially adopted by wholesaler Arthur Tappan in the 1820s and experimented with by Lord & Taylor in 1838 and Rowland Macy in the early 1850s. Similarly, bar codes and electronic scanning—key building blocks of new retailing practices—began in the grocery industry. Kmart became the first major nonfood retailer to employ them as a means of tracking inventory in the early 1980s, several years before Walton made this technology a core building block of his distribution system.<n>This chapter will examine the differences between the traditional re-tail model and lean retailing. We explore how the set of practices that traditional retailers drew on to merchandise and distribute products became increasingly costly. Then we return to why retailers—-Wal-Mart, Kmart, J. C. Penney, Dillard’s Inc., Federated Department Stores, and others—adapted technologies and management practices to handle demand uncertainty, product proliferation, and complex sourcing decisions.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch3.txt
Design changes can be implemented in minutes. For example, if the apparel item is a skirt, the proposed material on the computer image can be changed with a few key strokes. Prints can be scanned into the computer and used as the pattern for the visual image. Entire collections can be created in a day with the selected materials draped on a sketched figure or actual photograph of a model. The colors of the blouse can be changed with a few computer steps. The color and texture of the rest of the garments in the photograph can be changed with equal ease. Computerized design systems collapse the time needed to explore new design ideas into hours of work, rather than the traditional work time of days or weeks. The resulting visual images can be shared with other decision-makers in the company wherever they might be, without the need to wait until everyone is in town for a meeting. Computer images can be viewed on the local area network or even put on the Internet in a secure form.<n>Other development applications allow designers to begin with an actual garment and make appropriate changes to achieve the desired design or construction modifications. In this case, designers pin the garment to a special design table. A computer pen is used to outline a panel of the garment with a sequence of contact points. The computer, on command, then connects the image of the points on its screen with a series of line segments that form the silhouette of the pattern piece. Another computer command adds the seam allowance and, after the desired modifications have been made, a piece of the new design is created. When all the individual pieces of the garment have been modified and entered into the computer system, the final garment pattern is ready to be cut and sewn into a sample garment. Numerically controlled fabric cutters are now available that can rapidly and accurately cut patterns from a single ply of cloth, removing the usual obstacle to sample garment-making. The cutting equipment is driven by the output of a pattern-grading and marker-making program.<n>Note that this entire design sequence can take as little as part of a day, yielding a sample garment hung on a mannequin. Again, the time it takes managers to reach a decision is what determines the length of this process. However, it may take months to produce a sample garment in a desired fabric simply because that fabric takes months to make.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
Simpler spreading machines have no on-board computer, but they do unroll the bolt of cloth “unstressed” and properly aligned with the edge of the ply below. However spreading is done, it is important for the plies to lie directly on top of each other. Misalignment of the edges can ruin many pattern pieces and the final garments for which they were intended. Once a ply is laid down, it is almost impossible to shift it because of the friction between the plies. With simple spreading machines, the operator must look for fabric defect indicators placed in the selvage by the textile manufacturer.<n>After the cloth is spread, it is ready for the appropriate marker to be fit on top and fixed to the lay of fabric. Sometimes staples are driven through the paper into the underlying cloth. If the lay is made by hand, then the cloth is generally cut directly by hand-guided electric knives that slice through the cloth on the table. If computer-controlled cutting is used, the lay of cloth is pulled onto the cutting table by an underlying paper sheet. In either case, the pattern pieces can now be cut.<n>Preassembly: The Cutting Room<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
Some magazine advertisements for upscale men’s dress suits tout hand-cutting by experienced tailors. Occasionally the ads include a drawing of a man with a large pair of scissors. But cloth is rarely cut this way, even when only one ply is cut at a time. An eight- or twelve-inch pair of scissors is an unwieldy instrument, difficult to guide within the 1/32th of an inch of the pattern outline. It is even harder to accurately cut the notches used by sewing operators to align cut parts.<n>Most often, an electrically driven vertical reciprocating knife is used to cut the fabric. The vertical knife oscillates less than three-quarters of an inch but can cut cloth plies a foot or more in thickness. The knife and motor are supported above the base plate by a frame. The frame also gives the cutter a place to grip the machine for hand-guided cutting. The base plate is a smooth cap with a slit to contain the moving end of the knife. The knives have built-in sharpeners that run a stone up and down the blade every few minutes. In such a “hand-cutting” operation, the operator guides the knife along the outlines on the paper marker fixed to the fabric lay. One hand holds the marker on the lay, the other guides the electric knife. When a pattern piece is cut from the lay, the cutter then makes the notch cuts indicated on the marker. These slits should be about one-eighth of an inch cut into the three-eighth-inch sewing margin around the pattern. The chances are high of making the slit too deep or forgetting it entirely. Computer-controlled cutting machines, on the other hand, do not forget.<n>Joseph Gerber solved the major problem in cutting—how to hold the cloth while the knife cuts through the material—by putting the entire lay on a vacuum table. The fabric lay with the marker on top is covered with a thin sheet of clear plastic. When the vacuum pump comes on, five pounds of force per square foot push down on the fabric. The thin plastic sheet effectively cuts off the flow of room air through the fabric. The vacuum holds the cloth firmly and compresses the thickness of the lay, typically by half.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
The investment per worker in a sewing room is quite modest. A simple new commercial sewing machine may cost $2,000 to $3,000, but a rebuilt machine can run as low as five hundred dollars and still provide a good dozen years of production. The average annual capital investment in sewing machines and attachments per operator in our survey was $720 (in 1992 dollars). Some of the machines in an American men’s dress-shirt plant like the one previously described will cost $20,000 or more, but such automated sewing systems are rare. As we have already noted, the general requirement for return on investment forces expensive capital equipment to be operated under more than single-shift conditions, unless it is essential to produce a given item. The automated sewing systems that create the closely spaced regular stitch patterns used as decorative top stitching on men’s dress shirts, collars, cuffs, and pockets are examples of expensive machines operated for a single shift.<n>Because assembly operations are driven more by labor costs than capital-intensive equipment, a typical American sewing factory operates just a single shift a day, with an average of about thirty-seven hours of work per week.11 On the men’s side of the industry, factories of up to several hundred workers are common, but smaller loft shops are typical for women’s apparel. Factories are located where the workforce lives. And the infrastructure needed to support a sewing room is relatively modest. Power in the form of electricity, water—especially if items like jeans are to be washed—and a phone are about all that is required. In some developing countries, workers are brought to the factories, which are generally located at the outer reaches of the local industrial infrastructure. These workers often live in dormitories on the factory compound for a period of a year before returning to their villages or moving into the city. Similar worker dormitory arrangements were part of the men’s suit industry in Japan as recently as fifteen years ago.<n>Apparel Assembly and the Demands of Rapid Replenishment<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
The redemptive impulse leads national courts to place an emphasis on values that resonate against past sins. The German Constitutional Court has made a number of controversial decisions that make sense primarily as efforts to resolve the burden of memory. The court decided to uphold a law abolishing the twenty-year statute of limitations for concentration camp murders.7 It invoked the constitutional “right to life” to strike down a liberal abortion law that permitted abortion on demand in the first trimester.8 And, more recently, the court rejected an East German statutory justification for border guards who shot at their own citizens trying to flee the country for the West.9 All of these decisions brought to the fore fundamental values of protecting life and punishing those with contempt for life. Yet, the particular German emphasis on these values would probably not appeal in the same measure to other European courts.<n>The Germans themselves have coined a unique, hard-to-translate phrase to describe the controversies that have driven their system of justice for the last fifty years. They call it Bewältigung der Vergangenheit—“overcoming” or “coming to grips with” the past. Settling accounts with the past provides a critical perspective on the process of redemption from evil. We cannot avoid the past, for we are all prisoners of it. In real life, we cannot reenact the forty years of wandering in the desert that the Hebrews had to endure before they could shake off their ingrained ways and a new generation could seek redemption under the law. In the world of practical politics, we must act now, and criminal punishment often provides the mechanism for distancing ourselves from the past so that we can start anew.<n>Civil War as the Path<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt
This would, admittedly, be an unconventional way of formulating the demands of the Thirteenth Amendment. The usual commentary on the amendment stresses simply that it omits the requirement of action by state officials that we find in the Bill of Rights and in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Yet, it is clear that the postbellum order sought to declare a fundamental value as the symbol of the new United States. The motive was similar to the impulse of the German drafters seeking to ground their postwar constitution in the humanistic values of human dignity. There may be intriguing and important differences between human dignity and autonomy, and we shall return to these later. For now, it is important to note merely that the postbellum legal order begins with a commitment of all state power to eliminate the evil that had cursed the United States since its founding.<n>Significantly, both human dignity and autonomy, both due process and equality, transcend the limits of the nation. It is not only our nationals who are entitled to these basic human rights. All human beings, all persons, should enjoy the same rights—at least so far as they are within the jurisdiction of the state securing those rights. Our commitment to nationhood generates the reciprocal sympathy that enables us to make the move from particular to universal. We may come to understand the meaning of basic rights in the context of the nation but then we are driven to see that all persons, whether members of the nation or not, are entitled to the same treatment.<n>Alternative Readings<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt
A final preliminary will bring us to our attempted definition of an autonomous agent. This preliminary is based on the distinction, noted above, between spontaneous and nonspontaneous chemical reactions. At equilibrium, the net rate of formation or destruction of each molecular species is zero, aside from small fluctuations that damp out. Thus, if two molecular species, X and Y, interconvert, the equilibrium is attained at that ratio of X and Y concentrations at which Y converts to X as fast as X converts to Y. If the reaction is displaced in one direction, say there is a higher X concentration than the equilibrium ratio, then the spontaneous, or exergonic, reaction proceeds in the direction toward equilibrium that reduces the excess of X concentration (Figure 3.3).<n>All spontaneous chemical reactions, if coupled to no other source of energy, are exergonic. On the other hand, if some other free energy source is coupled to the reaction, the reaction can be driven “beyond equilibrium” by using some of the energy source. Reactions that are driven beyond equilibrium by addition of free energy are called endergonic.

All spontaneous chemical reactions, if coupled to no other source of energy, are exergonic. On the other hand, if some other free energy source is coupled to the reaction, the reaction can be driven “beyond equilibrium” by using some of the energy source. Reactions that are driven beyond equilibrium by addition of free energy are called endergonic. Thus X might convert to Y, and this reaction might be coupled to another source of free energy, such that the steady state concentration of Y is much higher than the normal equilibrium X:Y ratio (Figure 3.3).<n>In the Carnot cycle, completion of the work cycle involved the cylinder piston system doing exergonic work on the external world during the power stroke, then the outside world doing work on the cylinder piston system when you pushed on the piston to recompress the working gas.

This reaction is purely exergonic. The reaction proceeds from the substrate fragments A’ and A’’ to form the product molecule A and approaches the equilibrium ratio of substrates to product. Ghadiri’s autocatalytic system is wonderful, but merely exergonic. It does not achieve a work cycle. In general, autocatalytic and collectively autocatalytic systems can be purely exergonic. In any such case, no work cycle is achieved.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
The first additional system consists in pyrophosphate, PP, a high-energy dimer of monophosphate that breaks down to form two monophosphates, P + P. Like any reaction, the reaction converting PP to P + P has an equilibrium, hence an equilibrium ratio of PP and P. In the presence of excess PP compared to equilibrium, the reaction flows toward equilibrium by the spontaneous cleavage of PP to yield P + P.<n>My purpose in invoking the exergonic conversion of PP to P + P is to utilize the loss of free energy in this exergonic reaction to drive the DNA trimer-hexamer reaction beyond its own equilibrium, leading thereby to an excess synthesis of the 3’CCCGGG5’ hexamer when compared to its equilibrium concentration. Thus, the excess synthesis of the hexamer, which would not occur spontaneously, is driven endergonically by being coupled to the exergonic breakdown of PP to P + P (Figure 3.4). In short, the exergonic breakdown of PP to P + P supplies the free energy to drive the excess buildup of 3’CCCGGG5’ concentration beyond its own equilibrium with respect to its trimer substrates, 5’GGG3’ and 5’CCC3’.<n>The excess synthesis of 3’CCCGGG5’ constitutes excess reproduction of the hexamer autocatalytic reaction product beyond that which would occur without the coupling to the additional PP free energy source. Thus, the system is reproducing “better” with the coupling to PP than without the coupling.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Once the pyrophosphate, PP, is cleaved to form P + P, as this reaction flows toward its own equilibrium ratio of PP to P, that free energy is used up. In order to have a renewed internal supply of the free energy needed to synthesize excess hexamer, it is convenient to resynthesize pyrophosphate from the two monophosphates, P + P. I’ll return below to the meaning of “convenient,” for in a general sense, the convenience reflects the organization of processes that sustains an agent, and that organization is not convenient, it is essential.<n>Resynthesis of PP from P + P requires the addition of free energy. This is true because we used the exergonic breakdown of PP to P + P to drive the excess synthesis of 3’CCCGGG5’. Now we need to add energy to resynthesize PP from P + P. To do so, I invoke an additional source of free energy in the form of an electron, e, which absorbs a photon, hv; is driven endergonically to an excited state, e*, and falls back exergonically to its low-energy state, e, in a reaction that is coupled to the synthesis of PP from P + P.<n>The point of this third reaction-couple is clear: PP is resynthesized from P + P so that PP can continue to drive the excess synthesis of the DNA hexamer, 3’CCCGGG5’. Overall, the total system of linked reactions is exergonic = there is an overall loss of free energy that is ultimately supplied by the incoming photon, hv, plus the 2 substrates, 5’GGG3’, and 5’CCC3’. Thus, we are not cheating the second law.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
The third feature to note is the work cycle performed by the agent. The simplest way of seeing the work cycle here is in the behavior of the PP  P + P reaction. In the Carnot cycle, the working gas cycles from compressed and hot to less compressed and cool, back to compressed and hot. In our hypothetical autonomous agent, there is a macroscopic cycle of matter from PP to P + P via the reaction- forming DNA hexamer and back around to PP via the reaction with the high-energy electron. The macroscopic cycling of matter around this cycle is the engine at work. (I am grateful to Peter Wills for this clarification of the concept of a chemical motor.) In addition, depending upon the details of the kinetic constants, our autonomous agent may literally show an oscillatory concentration cycle in which PP concentration begins high and falls as P + P is formed, then the high PP concentration is reformed by use of the photon-energized exergonic e*  e reaction.<n>Thus, the PP P + P reaction embedded in the autonomous agent constitutes a chemical engine in which there is a macroscopic net flux of matter around the PP  P + P cycle, which is operating displaced from equilibrium as it is driven by addition of energy from the photon, hv, and addition of the two DNA trimers, and as energy is drained oV to drive excess synthesis of the DNA hexamer.<n>The fourth thing to note about the autonomous agent is that, like the Carnot engine, the steam engine, the gas engine, and the electric engine, the autonomous agent works in a cycle. At the end of the cycle the system is poised to cycle again. A repeating organization of process is achieved. And next, just as the Carnot engine run backward is a refrigerator and not a pump, if the reactions of the autonomous agent were run backward the PP  P + P engine would run in the reverse direction. This is because all reaction couples would be displaced from equilibrium the opposite way and the analogue of throwing the gears in reverse, namely reversing in sign the positive and negative activator and inhibitor couplings to the two proper enzymes, would convert the excess energy stored in the above equilibrium concentration of hexamer into production of the two trimers and the resynthesis of PP from P + P. Were the release of the photon, hv, a readily reversible step, the excess of PP would drive emission of a photon by the excited electron, thus returning the electron to the initial unexcited state.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Well, it seems straightforward enough; we all know more or less what it is to make a living. For example, I am currently writing Investigations as part of my own hopefully not-too-solipsistic eVorts to make my own living as a scientist.<n>But natural games are not quite so straightforward. I begin by mentioning again the rather surprising no-free-lunch theorem proved by Bill Macready and David Wolpert as postdoctoral fellows at the Santa Fe Institute a few years ago. Recall that Bill and David were wondering whether there might be some search algorithm for adapting on a fitness landscape that was inherently better than all other algorithms. For example, John Holland, another Santa Fe Institute colleague, is justly well-known for inventing his “genetic algorithm” to optimize hard computational problems. The genetic algorithm, which has been rather widely used in academic and industrial settings, is based on analogy with biological adaptation driven by mutation, recombination, and selection.<n>In eVect, Bill and David were wondering whether biological systems in this biosphere happen to have stumbled on the best possible optimization procedure. Importantly, the answer appears to be no. Macready and Wolpert considered a mathematically well-formulated set of “all possible fitness landscapes” and showed that, averaged over all landscapes, no search algorithm outperforms any other algorithm. No free lunch.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Yet we hardly know how to say what this propagation and elaboration of organization and process is, nor have we a clue about whether there may be general laws that govern such self-constructing nonequilibrium processes. Such a law could be my hoped-for fourth law of thermodynamics for open self-constructing systems.<n>We have begun with autonomous agents. But we are here driven beyond bio-spheres. What are the general conditions that allow such self-constructing nonequilibrium processes to flourish? Are biospheres the only examples? What of the evolution of the geology of a planet, a solar system, a galaxy, the universe as a whole? Are there ways of thinking about the emergence of structures that measure and discover sources of energy in nonequilibrium systems, together with the emergence of structures and processes that couple to sources of energy, do work to construct constraints, and propagate the constrained release of the discovered energy such that more diverse structures, constraints, and processes can arise, de novo, in the adjacent possible of the evolving universe?<n>Is the universe highly diverse, and is our biosphere diverse, because there is some general law or tendency for such nonequilibrium self-constructing systems to diversify? I confess I suspect so. In an intuitive nutshell, in a nonequilibrium setting, the greater the diversity of structures, potential reactions, or other transformations among structures, measurement processes and devices, coupling devices, and constraints that already exist in a ramified web of propagating structures, reactions, work, measurement, constraint and coupling constructions, the easier it is for the total system to generate new kinds of molecules or other structures, processes, measurement devices, couplings, and constraints such that a biosphere or the universe can expand into the newness of its adjacent possible. But those new structures, processes, measuring devices, couplings, and constraints in turn increase the total diversity, hence, enable yet further expansion into the adjacent possible, creating perpetual autocatalytic novelty on timescales that must be vastly longer than the current age of the universe.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
My Rube Goldberg device propagates work; it succeeds in creating a sequence of coordinated macroscopic changes in the physical universe. I do not know a formal definition of “propagating work,” so, in the absence of anything better, I will point at what I mean by Figure .b.<n>We have some clues in place now. Work is the constrained release of energy. Often constraints themselves are the consequence of work. I have tentatively defined an autonomous agent as a self-reproducing system that carries out at least one work cycle. In turn, this led us to note that an autonomous agent is necessarily a nonequilibrium device, therefore, that it stores energy. To think about work cycles, we have been driven to ask about Maxwell’s demon, measurement, when and why measurement pays, thence to what features of a nonequilibrium system are measured such that they constitute a source of energy, thence to how couplings arise that capture the energy source, thence to work and constraints, and now to propagating work due to the occurrence of linked sets of constraints and flows of matter and energy.<n>A next step is to realize that the only well-known autonomous agents, namely real cells such as yeast, bacteria, your cells and mine, do actually carry out linked processes in which spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes are coupled to build constraints on the release of energy. The energy, once released, constitutes work that propagates to carry out more work, building more constraints on the release of energy, which when released constitutes work that propagates further.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
I do get stuck at Gregorian creatures. Even here, the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language, wherever new sentences can be created, is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole. If the conversation we recent two-legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive, so too is the chemical conversation in any full-fledged ecosystem, where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another.<n>I suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere, with its urgent diversity in which, emboldened by all our know-how, we do get on with a very rich conversation, may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks. We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and e-mail, I guess. Smart place, a biosphere, lots to talk about. Four billion years of yammering. Slapstick comedy may have started a long time ago.<n>Ethics<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt
Consider an ecosystem with dierent species of bacteria. Each species may secrete dierent chemical species, S, that impinge on a subset, C, of the other cell species. In Figure . I show a three-dimensional coordinate system. One axis shows the order-chaos axis for a single isolated bacterium, measured by Derrida curve criteria, with order on the left, near the origin, and chaos on the right. The remaining axes show C and S.<n>If a given cell is at the phase transition between order and chaos, and additional molecular inputs, S per cell, come from C dierent types of cells, the total connectivity in the cell is raised from KN to KN + CS. The results will typically drive that cell into the chaotic regime. Indeed, the entire community will be driven into the chaotic regime.<n>Hence, in the coordinate system of Figure ., Igor Yakushin at Bios Group has shown that a hyperbolic surface, as shown, separates the ordered regime from the chaotic regime. Cells can buer themselves from chemical perturbations from other species by retreating deeper into the ordered regime. This can be accomplished by increasing the number of canalyzing inputs per gene. And indeed, as described above, individual eukaryotic cells do appear to lie well within the ordered regime, perhaps as buering for the fact that such cells, like yeast, live in microbial communities or, like human cells, live in tissues where each cell is bombarded with chemical signals from other cells in the same body.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
By the fourth mechanism, if Godzilla’ happens to have a beneficial landscape ruggedness due to its K value, that good landscape ruggedness has now replicated from the initial Godzilla to its copy. So good landscape ruggedness can spread, by natural selection, through the model ecosystem, hence, landscape ruggedness can evolve.<n>The results are shown in Figure .. Indeed, landscape ruggedness does evolve to an intermediate ruggedness. During this evolution, the mean interval between extinction events increases dramatically, hence, the mean number of extinction events decreases. In this sense, all the creatures that remain become fitter due to the coevolutionary tuning of landscape ruggedness. In addition, when Godzilla’ replaces the hapless species that now goes extinct, its econeighbors find themselves interacting with Godzilla’ itself. They may not be as fit interacting with Godzilla’ as with the first species, hence, they too may be invaded and driven extinct in turn.<n>In short, avalanches of extinction events can propagate. Figure . shows that the distribution is a power law, with many small and few large extinction events. Moreover, once a new species comes into existence, say, Godzilla’, it may not fare well in its new niche, hence, may go extinct soon. But if it lasts in its niche, it may be well adapted, hence, resistant to being driven extinct. The results (Figure .a) are a power law distribution of species lifetimes.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt

Recall the Noah’s Vessel experiment, with two of every species ground up in a blender, breaking all cell membranes, comingling the trillion or so proteins of the hundred million species with the thousands of small molecule metabolites. A supracritical explosion of chemical diversity would presumably ensue. As I noted, life has learned to avoid that fate. Cells are subcritical. Were they not, then any new chemical that chanced to enter the cells of Fredricka the fern would unleash a cascade of synthesis of novel molecular species, some of which would presumably kill poor Fredricka. Best defense? Stay subcritical. Why mess with that mess?<n>But recall that a mixed microbial community should be able to be driven to the subcritical-supracritical boundary by increasing the diversity of microbial species present and/or hitting the community with a sucient diversity of novel small molecule species. My argument follows that if the community is supracritical, the novel cascading molecular species will kill o some of the microbial species, thereby lowering the community toward the subcritical regime. On the other hand, mutation and immigration should drive the community toward the supracritical regime. Do mixed microbial communities hover on the subcritical-supracritical boundary? We have seen other reasons that bound a community’s complexity, including Ksat problems noted in this chapter. So a better question is: Can microbial communities be driven supracritical? And if so, are they often near that boundary?<n>Of course, I do not know, but the hypothesis is testable. Increase the diversity of species and test for the diversity of synthesized small molecules, say, by gas chromatography. A colleague and I once devised such an experiment with mixtures of increasingly diverse moss species, planning to measure the molecular diversity of gas species evolved as a function of community diversity and the diversity in gas species introduced to the community. We went skiing instead. I still like the lines of the experiment. It could be carried out directly with mixed microbial communities as well.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
If this view is correct, then diversity of goods and services is a major driver of economic growth. Indeed, I believe that the role of diversity of goods and services is the major unrecognized factor driving economic growth. Jane Jacobs had made the same point in her thoughtful books about the relation between economic growth and economic diversity of cities and their hinterlands. Economist Jose Scheinkman, now chairman of economics at the University of Chicago, and his colleagues studied a number of cities, normalized for total capitalization, and found that economic growth correlated with economic diversity in the city. In a similar spirit, microfinancing of a linked diversity of cottage businesses in the third world and the first world seems to be achieving local economic growth where more massive eorts at education and infrastructure, Aswan dams and power grids, seem to fail.<n>Indeed, in the same way in an ecosystem, organisms create niches for other organisms. I suspect, therefore, that over the past . billion years, the growth of diversity of species is autocatalytic, for the number of possible niches increases more rapidly than the number of species filling niches. And in the linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes, the universe as a whole advances autocatalytically into its adjacent possible, driven by the very increase of diversity by which novel displacements from equilibrium come into existence, are detected, are coupled to, and come to drive the endergonic creation of novel kinds of molecules and other entities. Economic growth is part and parcel of the creativity of the universe as a whole.<n>Think of the Wright brothers’ airplane. It was a recombination between an airfoil, a light gasoline engine, bicycle wheels, and a propeller. The more objects an economy has, the more novel objects can be constructed. When we were working with rough stone in the Lower Paleolithic, we pretty much mastered everything that could be done until pressure flaking came along. Most forms of simple stone tools that could be made were made. Today, the adjacent possible of goods and services is so vast that the economy, stumbling and lunging into the future adjacent possible, will only construct an ever smaller subset of the technologically possible.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
Not only are function and form separate, over their long lives buildings can successfully accommodate a variety of uses. For example, some of the most famous museums (the Louvre, the Hermitage, the Belvedere) started life as royal palaces; the Uffizi in Florence is so named because it originally housed offices; and the Prado in Madrid was designed to be a museum of science, not art. The acclaimed Musée d’Orsay in Paris is housed in a railroad station. Two of my favorite small museums, the Frick Collection in New York City and the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., were built as residences. As historic preservation and adaptive reuse demonstrate, you can shop in a renovated warehouse, do office work in a converted loft, or live in a barn. Assuming, of course, that the warehouse, the loft, and the barn were well built. The material fabric of old buildings—the heavy beams, rough brick walls, and solid woodwork—is one of their chief pleasures. That is why we feel cheated by hollow walls, flimsy doors, and shaky balustrades. Buildings should last and feel as though they will.<n>One might assume that just as the highest-rated cars—Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus—represent the highest standards of automobile technology, the most admired architecture would be the best built. This was generally true in the past, but in the twentieth century, when new materials and new aesthetic theories often have driven architects to cavalier experimentation, even celebrated architects have fallen short in that department. Le Corbusier’s white suburban villas, for example, were crudely finished in cement plaster on top of brick, and since the architect usually ignored (for aesthetic reasons) intrusive metal flashing and coping strips, the crude “machines for living” often aged poorly. Some Frank Lloyd Wright buildings have leaky skylights, sagging overhangs, and defective heating systems. This does not make them any less delightful to visit, but it must make them considerably less delightful to inhabit. Perhaps the most dramatic example of failed experimentation in recent years is the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, which opened in 1977. The building was widely praised for its architectural innovation—the British periodical Architectural Design called it “a seminal building of the Modern Movement.” The architects Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers turned the building literally inside-out. They dramatically hung pipes, ducts, fire stairs, elevators, and escalators from the exterior structure. These previously hidden elements were now exposed in plain sight—and exposed to the elements. The result might have been foreseen: after only twenty years, the French government was obliged to close the building for a two-year renovation. Although the authorities maintained that the renovation was required because of the unexpectedly large number of visitors, according to Le Monde almost half of the $90 million budget was spent on refurbishing the façade.<n>The University of Pennsylvania, where I teach, is the site of Louis I. Kahn’s A. N. Richards Medical Research Laboratory. This structural tour-de-force of precast concrete and brick brought its designer international acclaim. I remember traveling from Montreal to Philadelphia as a student to see the building a few years after it was built. My classmates and I particularly admired the exposed concrete structure and the explicit separation of what Kahn called “servant” and “served” spaces—massive brick ventilation shafts and delicate, glass-enclosed individual laboratories. However, The latter proved to be unpopular with their occupants. The large windows let in too much light (today, most are papered over with aluminum foil), cement dust from the exposed concrete beams falls on the lab tables, and the rigid plan has proved inflexible to changing needs.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch1.txt

Finally, Sparta, with naval help from former foe Persia, blockaded what was then the Hellespont (now the Dardanelles Strait), thus cutting off Athens from its crucial supply of grain. Starvation and heavy naval losses proved too much for Athens, and the Spartans claimed total victory.<n>Sparta attempted to govern the city through a council of 30 men, known as the “Thirty Tyrants,” who spent most of their time persecuting opponents and confiscating property. In less than a year they were driven from the city, and Sparta, embroiled in other conflicts, let Athens re-establish its maritime alliances without resistance.<n>But Athens was never to regain her earlier military or political influence. A new star rose in the north — that of Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great. He advanced the far-sighted scheme of a federation of Greek states, which Athens resisted. Some Athenians even urged the Assembly to declare war on the Macedonian King. (The fiery Philippics, speeches on the subject by master orator Demosthenes, rate among the finest of their kind.) Following defeat at the battle of Chaeronea in 338 b.c., however, the Athenians accepted an alliance with other states and even sent Philip a gold crown as a token of submission.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-History.txt
Prussia — and Napoleon<n>With his ambition of uniting the states of Brandenburg and Prussia, it was the Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm (1640–1688) who prepared Berlin to become a strong capital, and fortified it as a garrison town. The first newcomers were 50 wealthy Jewish families who had been expelled from Vienna in 1671. Then 14 years later 5,600 Huguenot Protestants arrived after being driven out of France by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. At a time when France was considered the cultural master of Europe, these sophisticated merchants and highly skilled craftsmen — among them jewelers, tailors, chefs, and restaurant-owners — brought a new refinement to the town.<n>This was further enhanced by the Great Elector’s son, who in 1701 crowned himself in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) King Friedrich in (not of) Prussia. Prompted by Sophie Charlotte, his wife, the king founded academies for the arts and sciences in Berlin. Baroque master Andreas Schlüter (see page 48) was commissioned to redesign the royal palace, which was knocked down in 1951 to make way for East Germany’s Palast der Republik. Sophie Charlotte’s residence, the grand Schloß Charlottenburg, has survived as a model of the era’s elegance.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt
The British North America Act of 1867 created the Dominion of Canada. John A. Macdonald, an Ontario Tory, was the first Prime Minister. To resist a turbulent United States torn by civil war, Anglo-Canadians wanted a strong central government delegating little more than municipal affairs to the provinces. French-Canadians insisted on a federal system with stronger provincial governments, to protect specific Québécois interests in property and civil rights. Henceforth, national unity always played second fiddle to ethnic, religious, and above all economic regional interests.<n>Only the promise of a transcontinental railway brought Nova Scotia immediately into the Confederation, with British Columbia joining in 1871, and Prince Edward Island in 1873. Rupert’s Land was bought from the H.B.C. in 1869, but incorporating Manitoba was not so easy. Led by Louis Riel, Métis descendants of Indians and French fur traders waged an armed struggle for land rights on the Red River in the face of the expansion-hungry railway builders. An impassioned politician as well as a fiery military leader, Riel won local Anglo-Saxon support for his proposed Manitoba Act guaranteeing equal French and English language rights in school and church. But the execution of a troublemaker from Toronto brought in a retaliatory force of Ontario troops, and Riel fled to the United States. The Métis were driven off their fertile land and back to hunting on the plains.<n>The railway literally created new cities like Winnipeg and Vancouver, which was the western terminus. Against all the experts’ advice, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company’s general manager, William Cornelius Van Horne, built tracks around Lake Superior and west across the Prairies to meet Andrew Onderdonk’s Chinese laborers working their way east through Kicking Horse Pass in the Rockies. The transcontinental dream became reality when the tracks were joined in 1885. But along the way, scores of laborers had died hacking through the mountains, buffalo were exterminated, and Indians and Métis were dispossessed of their lands.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt

Many business people from Toronto have been driven close to apoplexy by the relaxed style of their Vancouver colleagues.<n>In keeping with this easy-going attitude, the city was originally known as Gastown, after saloon-keeper “Gassy Jack” Deighton, who looked after the needs of pioneer lumbermen and sailors in the 1860s. It was only when the town became C.P.R.’s West Coast railway terminus in 1886 that it took on the more dignified name of one of the region’s first European visitors, navigator George Vancouver. A fire in 1886 and property-developers left few traces of the 19th-century town, but bold contemporary architecture downtown and out at the Simon Fraser and University of British Columbia campuses blends beautifully with the mountain and ocean backdrop. Unsightly docklands have been cleaned up, and handsome new housing has been built on the waterfront.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Grijalva’s stories focused Spanish attention on central Mexico, and in 1519 Hernan Cortés landed in Veracruz, to start an expedition that would end in the conquest of Moctezuma and the Aztec Empire. Though he had begun his campaign without the King’s authority, once news of the treasures captured by Cortés reached Madrid, a royal warrant was dispatched to legitimize the victory and create “New Spain” — the latest Spanish colony. However, it was left to Don Francisco de Montejo, “a gentleman of Seville,” following in the great conquistador’s wake, to take possession of the Yucatán in the name of the Spanish king.<n>Arriving on the coast in 1527, Montejo’s forces were hindered by the dense jungle and withering climate, and were met by fierce resistance from the natives. To make matters worse, news of great riches discovered in Peru led many of his men to desert in search of greater rewards. The campaign went so badly that by 1535 the Spaniards had been completely driven out of the Yucatán.<n>In 1537 another force, under the command of Montejo el Mozo (the Younger), Don Francisco’s son, set out to plant the Spanish standard on Yucatecan soil. At first ill fortune dogged them; the dwindling force was besieged in Champotón, on the west coast, for two miserable years. With reinforcements, the Spaniards managed to establish a beachhead. A band of only 57 men, led by Montejo el Mozo’s cousin (yet another Don Francisco), marched inland to take the Mayan village of T’Ho. The Indians gathered their forces for one last great battle, and thousands of them fell upon the Spanish camp, now defended by 200 men. The horses and superior weaponry of the Spaniards gave them the edge, and they slaughtered hundreds of Indian warriors. After the battle, local chiefs made peace with the invaders and, on 6 January 1542, the Montejos founded the Spanish city of Mérida on the site.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt
In 1821, Mexico declared its independence from Spain. Tension had been simmering for decades, fostered by Spain’s treatment of her New Spanish-born colonists, or criollos (deemed to be second-class citizens compared to those born in the homeland). Her trade laws decreed that everything produced in New Spain must first cross the Atlantic to Spain before being traded with a third country so that the proper taxes and tariffs could be collected. The geography of the northern Yucatán region separated it physically from the rest of New Spain, and fewer colonial landowners settled here than the area around the new capital (now Mexico City). Furthermore, this isolation led to the development of a strong independent streak for both colonists and indigenous peoples. The Yucatán declared its independence in 1821 but did not join the fledgling country of Mexico until 1823. In 1840, it changed its mind, and withdrew from the union. This was the catalyst for the oppressed Maya to take up arms against their colonial oppressors.<n>In 1847, a savage uprising known as the Caste War saw Mayan rebels massacre white settlers and take control of nearly two-thirds of the peninsula. By 1850 they had driven the Mexicans back to their strongholds in Mérida and Campeche. However, in an amazing turnaround, the Maya’s ancient beliefs became their undoing. Just when the Mexicans were on the point of surrender, the rains came early and the Indians, obedient to their gods, dropped their weapons and returned to their milpas to plant the sacred corn. The settlers called in reinforcements and wreaked a terrible revenge on the natives. One group of rebels, known as the Chan Santa Cruz, held out in the jungles of Quintana Roo around the city of Tulum, harrying the Mexicans and making the east coast of the Yucatán a dangerous area, off-limits until well into the 20th century.<n>The Henequen Boom<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt
Dubbed “the fairest mountain among the fair mountains of the world,” Mt. Emei reaches an altitude of well over 3,000 m (over 10,000 ft). You don’t have to climb all the way to the summit of Emeishan to appreciate its charm and mystique. But the higher you go, the more chance you’ll have of sighting the rich fauna of the hill forests, from gregarious monkeys to red pandas. This was the traditional Buddhist “Peak of the West,” the mountain shrine to countless pilgrims, emperors included.<n>At the foot of Mt. Emei are the 16th-century Loyalty to Country Temple (Baoguosi) and the Crouching Tiger Temple (Fuhusi), foreshadowing the many temples ahead. There are monasteries and famous scenic spots every few kilometers along the paths to the summit, but this is a climb (for the energetic only) that requires several days. Many tourists have time to spend only a night on the mountain in one of the basic inns, such as those at the Shrine of Limpid Waters (Jinshui), before being driven to the summit before dawn to see the famous sunrise.<n>At sunrise on Golden Peak (Jinding) pilgrims and vacationers alike gather in hopes of seeing an optical phenomenon called “Buddha’s Halo.” Here, each viewer can see his or her shadow perfectly framed inside a bright halo formed when the morning sea of clouds below Suicide Precipice is penetrated by the rising sun.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
