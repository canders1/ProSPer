Chassis Antie will be implemented on a tiny Road Warrior robotic system. [SEP] Behaviors will be coded in Interactive C, for which some pseudocode is included. [SEP] Sensors will include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors. [SEP] Antie be a circular robot, no more than 1cm in diameter (the length of a red harvester ant), with two	driving	wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization. [SEP] A gripper will be located on the front of the robot consisting of two elongated tongs. [SEP] Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors, sonar detectors and chemical emitters, including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging. [SEP] These sacs will be refilled at a filling station each morning as Antie determines that they are getting depleted. [SEP] Antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance. [SEP] For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that Antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day. [SEP] A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached.
