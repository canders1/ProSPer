sense that it came, as I said, on the eve of trial, when we knew that there was	going	to be an issue with respect to their testimony at trial. [SEP] It was an attempt to bring this to a head. It was	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2

And approximately when was that? [SEP] In October, I believe it was, in '04. [SEP] It was in the newspaper that they were	going	to be teaching their intelligent design from Of Pandas and People. [SEP] And did you attend that board meeting?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2
And did you learn anything else from reading the newspapers at that time? [SEP] Well, that they were	going	to read the statement in the classroom, yes. [SEP] Okay. [SEP] Now, I'd like to ask you to take a look in the notebook at what's been marked as P127.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2
Can you tell us what it is? [SEP] It's the newsletter that came to the house in the mail that told -- that had the statement included that they were	going	to be teaching in the biology class. [SEP] Now, do you know approximately when you received this?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2
And can you tell us what harm you believe that it has caused you? [SEP] Late in '04 my daughter came home from school, and I was discussing kind of what was	going	on in the district with her. [SEP] And she looked at me and she said, Well, Mom, evolution is a lie, what kind of Christian are you, anyway, which I found to be very upsetting. [SEP] Did you ask her why she said that?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2
Did you ask her why she said that? [SEP] Yeah, I asked her why she said that, and she said in school what they had been talking about or amongst her friends and what's	going	on. [SEP] She seemed to be under the impression that as a Christian, she could not believe that evolution was a science that, you know, was true. [SEP] And how did that harm you?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2
I didn't ask you that question. [SEP] I asked you, in 2003, did you attend a board meeting? [SEP] I'm	going	to say I don't remember which board meetings I attended. [SEP] In --	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2

"This newsletter has been produced to help explain the changes in the biology curriculum. Unfortunately, a great deal of misinformation has been spread regarding this policy. We hope this publication will help those interested better understand the substance of the policy while eliminating any misconceptions some may have about the curriculum change. We sincerely appreciate your understanding on this matter." [SEP] Thank you. [SEP] It was through this policy that you first learned about the statement that was	going	to be read. [SEP] Is that correct? [SEP] No, I believe -- no, I heard about it before.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2
I don't think so. [SEP] So this was the first time that you saw the statement that was	going	to be read to the students in the ninth-grade biology class. [SEP] Is that correct? [SEP] I believe so.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2
As far as I can tell. [SEP] And so this newsletter was actually providing information to the residents of Dover as to what the actual newsletter was -- excuse me, what the actual statement was	going	to say. [SEP] Is that correct? [SEP] Yes.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2
it's common sense. [SEP] Now I think we're	going	afield. [SEP] I'll sustain the objection. [SEP] We're now clearly outside the scope of direct, the	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2

Do you recall any other board members saying anything during the course of any discussion about the biology textbook? [SEP] Well, like I said, I was reentering the room from the bathroom, so I was sort of in the doorway. [SEP] And I obviously didn't know what Max had said to the board but that he had spoken to the board. [SEP] So the comments that were coming back were, I assume, directed at him. [SEP] But there were comments from Bill Buckingham about brainwashing, and I remember hearing that, the whole thing about brainwashing, because it dealt with	going	to college and getting this education and students who go to college become brainwashed. [SEP] And I was very upset by that because I attended college and I don't feel as if I were brainwashed. [SEP] And also I recall Alan Bonsell making a comment about, you know, there are only two theories, there's this theory evolution and there's this theory creation, and if you're teaching only those two theories, then there's not a problem. [SEP] Do you recall anything else Mr. Bonsell said?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2
Yes, I do recall Bill Buckingham making comments about, you know, the apes and monkeys -coming from apes and monkeys. [SEP] And I also -- Your Honor, again, objection.

To my students taking a PSSA test, well, you know, I -- being an educator, I'm not in love with PSSA tests or standardized tests. [SEP] But if you're asking me if I object to my daughter taking a standardized test with that information on it, of course not. [SEP] I would hope that they would provide lots of academic information on those tests. [SEP] And is it your understanding that because Dover is a standards-driven district, that they're	going	to focus their class time on preparing students to achieve proficiency on those standard-based assessments? [SEP] I'm sorry, can you repeat that?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2
I'm sorry, can you repeat that? [SEP] Yes. [SEP] Is it your understanding that because Dover is a standard-based district, the class instruction is	going	to focus on preparing students to achieve proficiency on those standard-based tests that we were just describing? [SEP] Not only is that my understanding, but that is what I would expect.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2
Is it your understanding that some of these additional books that were put in the library are actually critical of intelligent design? [SEP] Actually, I am, because I recall them -- an organization actually sending the library those books, because there was controversy in those books being put in there, too. [SEP] And there were many members of the community who had called to see whether those books had actually gotten there or not, into the library, because we weren't certain that those books were	going	to be allowed in the library, permitted in the library. [SEP] They're in the library?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2

It looks to me to be a copy of a letter to the editor that I wrote. [SEP] And I'm	going	to ask you to read this letter into the record. [SEP] Okay.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	2

 peaceful is in our nation's interests. [SEP] Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest. [SEP] I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president. [SEP] I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy. [SEP] I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night. [SEP] He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him. [SEP] He's man of solid judgment and he's	going	to be a person to stand by my side. [SEP] One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people. [SEP] I've been able to set clear goals. [SEP] The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals. [SEP] That's what a Chief Executive Officer does. [SEP] So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.

Let's go through some of the specifics now. [SEP] New question. [SEP] Vice President Gore, the governor mentioned the Middle East. [SEP] Here we're talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have. [SEP] What do you think the United States should do right now to resolve that conflict over there? [SEP] The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there. [SEP] We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured. [SEP] We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been	going	on. [SEP] I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there. [SEP] The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now. [SEP] It's a very tense situation there. [SEP] But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there. [SEP] It's too much to hope that this is	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
Governor? [SEP] Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions. [SEP] Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. [SEP] I think credibility is	going	to be very important in the future in the Middle East. [SEP] I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
You agree with that, Governor? [SEP] I do. [SEP] I do think this, though. [SEP] When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place. [SEP] It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis. [SEP] Secondly, any lasting peace is	going	to have to be a peace that's good for both sides. [SEP] And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense. [SEP] This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table. [SEP] I will try to do the same thing. [SEP] But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East. [SEP] People watching here tonight are very interested in Middle East policy, and they are so interested they want to base their vote on differences between the two of you as president how you would handle Middle East policy. [SEP] Is there any difference?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
Saddam Hussein, you mean, get him out of there? [SEP] I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well. [SEP] We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be. [SEP] He is a danger. [SEP] We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East. [SEP] And it's	going	to be hard, it's	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2

[SEP] I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked. [SEP] The administration deserves credit for having made it work. [SEP] It is important for NATO to have it work. [SEP] It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe. [SEP] And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is	going	to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.

Vice President Gore, do you agree with the governor's views on nation building, the use of military, our military, for nation building as he described and defined it? [SEP] I don't think we agree on that. [SEP] I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas. [SEP] I think we have to be very reticent about that. [SEP] But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly. [SEP] The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together. [SEP] Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world. [SEP] All these other countries are looking to us. [SEP] Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from	going	in anywhere. [SEP] Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. [SEP] This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II. [SEP] During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. [SEP] The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. [SEP] And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. [SEP] We got intimately i	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
The use of the military, there -- some people are now suggesting that if you don't want to use the military to maintain the peace, to do the civil thing, is it time to consider a civil force of some kind that comes in after the military that builds nations or all of that? Is that on your radar screen? I don't think so. I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations. Maybe I'm missing something here. I mean, we're	going	to have kind of a nation building core from America? Absolutely not. Our military is meant to fight and win war. That's what it's meant to do. And when it gets overextended, morale drops. I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability.

[SEP] The governor mentioned it earlier. [SEP] I've worked on this issue. [SEP] It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.

First, a couple of follow-ups from the vice presidential debate last week. [SEP] Vice President Gore, would you support or sign, as president, a federal law banning racial profiling by police and other authorities at all levels of government? [SEP] Yes, I would. [SEP] The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing. [SEP] I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem. I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there. And I know it's been	going	on a long time. In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2

Would you support a national hate crimes law? [SEP] I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version. [SEP] But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books. [SEP] That bill did -- there was another bill that did die in committee. [SEP] But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're	going	to go after all crime. [SEP] And we're	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
New subject, new question. [SEP] Another vice presidential debate follow-up. [SEP] Governor, both Senator Lieberman and Secretary Cheney said they were sympathetically rethinking their views on same sex relationships. [SEP] What's your position on that? [SEP] I'm not for gay marriage. [SEP] I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman. [SEP] And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act. [SEP] I presume the Vice President supported it when the President signed that bill and supports it now. [SEP] But I think marriage is a sacred institution. [SEP] I'm	going	to be respectful for people who may disagree with me. [SEP] I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas. [SEP] I've been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other people's points of view. [SEP] But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman. [SEP] Vice President Gore?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
Well, but it's a logical response. [SEP] Well, I have no idea. [SEP] I mean, he can throw out all kinds -- I don't know the particulars of this law. I will tell you I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation. As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further. I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life. [SEP] And I think that's a private matter. [SEP] And I think that's the way it ought to be. [SEP] But I'm	going	to be respectful for people, I'll tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people. [SEP] Special rights, how does that affect gays and lesbians?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
Governor? [SEP] Well, it starts with enforcing law. [SEP] When you say loud and clear to somebody if you're	going	to carry a gun illegally, we're	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
All right. [SEP] Who would issue the -- The state. The state. I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns. There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records. [SEP] And the "Los Angeles Times" spent a lot of ink	going	into that. [SEP] But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns. [SEP] I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now. [SEP] Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people. [SEP] The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns. [SEP] That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy. [SEP] Back to the question about the differences on gun control. [SEP] What are they, Governor, from your point of view, between you and the Vice Pres	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life? [SEP] So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs. [SEP] Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you. [SEP] So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong. [SEP] And we can enforce law. [SEP] But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law. But there's a larger law. Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. And that's where our society must head if we're	going	to be a peaceful and prosperous society. I also believe in the Golden Rule. And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said. We do have a serious problem in our culture. Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children. She's worked on it longer than I have. But I feel very strongly about that. And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that. But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting. [SEP] But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns. [SEP] I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. [SEP] And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
t's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. [SEP] And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands. [SEP] Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law. [SEP] Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun. What matters is something in this person's head says there is not	going	to be a consequence. So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws. We added beds. We're tough. We believe in tough love. We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained. And that's what needs to happen. We've got laws. If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important. New question. As I was saying. Both of you -- Governor, both of you have talked much about Medicare and health care for seniors. [SEP] What about the more than 40 million younger Americans who do not have health insurance right now? [SEP] What would you do about that?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
Let's let the governor respond to that. [SEP] Are those numbers correct? [SEP] Are his charges correct? [SEP] If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong. [SEP] We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people. [SEP] And they get health care. [SEP] Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care. [SEP] But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased. [SEP] He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population. [SEP] And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're	going	to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd. [SEP] Let me just tell you who the jury is. [SEP] The people of Texas. [SEP] There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me. [SEP] And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person. [SEP] So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around. [SEP] I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right. [SEP] We come together both Republicans and Democrats. [SEP] Let me put that directly to you, Vice President Gore. [SEP] The reason you brought this up, is it -- are you suggesting tha	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
What is not true, Governor? [SEP] That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending. The top -- let's talk about my tax plan. [SEP] The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes. [SEP] And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. [SEP] That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is	going	to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief. [SEP] We just have a different point of view. [SEP] It's a totally different point of view. [SEP] He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. [SEP] I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. [SEP] Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute. [SEP] We pay 4.7 billion. [SEP] I can't emphasize to you how much. [SEP] I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place. [SEP] The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session. [SEP] We're working hard to sign up children. [SEP] We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state. [SEP] We're making really good progress. [SEP] And our state cares a lot about our children. [SEP] My priority is	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
Explain what a brown field is to those who don't follow this. [SEP] A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers. [SEP] And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit. [SEP] I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met. [SEP] The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment. And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now. I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money	going	to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality. [SEP] I think we need to have clean coal technologies. [SEP] I propose $2 billion worth. [SEP] By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area. And it was a smart move because there's gas reserves up there. We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down. Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that's what we did in Texas.

I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with. But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming. I think that we do. It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this.

New question. [SEP] Last question. [SEP] For you, Governor. [SEP] And this flows somewhat out of the Boston debate. [SEP] You, your running mate, your campaign officials have charged that Vice President Gore exaggerates, embellishes and stretches the facts, etcetera. [SEP] Are you -- do you believe these are serious issues? This is a serious issue that the voters should use in deciding which one of you two men to vote for on November 7? Well, we all make mistakes. I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself, you know, if you know what I mean. I think credibility is important. It is	going	to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations. And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider. This isn't something new. I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims.

[SEP] It's time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage. [SEP] I want to do something about Social Security. [SEP] It's an important priority, because now is the time to act and we're	going	to say to our seniors, our promises we've made to you will be promises kept. [SEP] But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money. [SEP] And finally, I do believe in tax relief. [SEP] I believe we can set our priorities. [SEP] I don't believe, like the vice president does, in huge government. [SEP] I believe in limited government. [SEP] By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills. [SEP] I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can.

All right. [SEP] Senator Kerry, a new question. [SEP] Let's talk about economic security. [SEP] You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. [SEP] But the price of everything is	going	up, and we all know it. [SEP] Health-care costs, as you are talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war. [SEP] My question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2

There is a tax gap. [SEP] And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? [SEP] The middle class. [SEP] I propose a detailed budget, Bob. [SEP] I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're	going	to reduce the deficit in half by five years. [SEP] It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress. [SEP] Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. [SEP] Two minutes. [SEP] And let's continue on jobs.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
They've cut the training money. [SEP] They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed. [SEP] I'm	going	to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect. [SEP] New question to you, Senator Kerry, two minutes. [SEP] And it's still on jobs. [SEP] You know, many experts say that a president really doesn't have much control over jobs. [SEP] For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress.

What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.

[SEP] Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered. [SEP] And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.

[SEP] We all know that Social Security is running out of money, and it has to be fixed. [SEP] You have proposed to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts.

The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut. [SEP] Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut. [SEP] I don't. [SEP] I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year. [SEP] And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're	going	to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country. [SEP] Now, we can do that.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has. [SEP] I have a plan to put America back to work. [SEP] And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're	going	to fix Social Security. [SEP] Mr. President?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
And we'll continue to do so over the next four years. [SEP] It's a subject I'm very familiar with. [SEP] After all, I was a border governor for a while. [SEP] Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons. [SEP] They're coming here to work. [SEP] If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5. [SEP] 15, you're	going	to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families. [SEP] And that's what's happening. [SEP] And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. [SEP] It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families. [SEP] See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it. [SEP] It also means it takes pressure off the border. [SEP] If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not	going	to have to sneak across the border. [SEP] It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job. [SEP] Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty. [SEP] I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior. [SEP] There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen. [SEP] And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11. [SEP] The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will. [SEP] Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it's all we have, it's not	going	to solve the problem. [SEP] The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring. [SEP] It's against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2

Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces. [SEP] Our military is overextended. [SEP] Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq,	going	to Iraq or have come back from Iraq. [SEP] One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it. [SEP] Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support. [SEP] In addition, I'm	going	to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve. [SEP] And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country. [SEP] There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security. [SEP] We ought to be doing that. [SEP] And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure. [SEP] But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing. [SEP] We'll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year. [SEP] I remember	going	on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia. [SEP] Some of them had been there before. [SEP] The people I talked to their spirits were high. [SEP] They didn't view their service as a back-door draft. [SEP] They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
You said that if Congress would vote to extend the ban on assault weapons, that you'd sign the legislation, but you did nothing to encourage the Congress to extend it. [SEP] Why not? [SEP] Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear. [SEP] I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never	going	to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties. [SEP] I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun. [SEP] I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them. [SEP] But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. [SEP] And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. [SEP] And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
So I believe America's less safe. [SEP] If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, "Sorry, we don't have the votes," I'd have said, "Then we're	going	to have a fight. " And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen.

[SEP] If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we	going	to get over those barriers?

Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college?

[SEP] I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	2
