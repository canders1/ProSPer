Mass retailers displaced wholesale-jobbers as soon as they were able to exploit a market as large as that covered by the wholesalers. [SEP] By building comparable purchasing organizations they could buy directly from manufacturers and develop a higher stock-turn than the jobbers. [SEP] Their administrative networks were more effective because they were in direct contact with the customers and because they eliminated one major set of middlemen.6 [SEP] Other factors	drove	the development of mass retail as well. [SEP] The rapid growth of urban cities and access to their downtown areas, initially with horse-drawn streetcars, encouraged mass retailers. [SEP] Department stores, with a wide range of goods arranged in “departments,” provided one-stop shopping, both novel and appealing to consumers of the period. [SEP] The increase in women seeking ready-made clothing and home furnishings also contributed to the rise of the department store as did newspaper advertising. [SEP] Although small specialty shops were limited to a few items, such as those found in a traditional dressmaker or milliner’s shop, department stores offered fixed prices and the convenience of returning purchases for exchange or cash. [SEP] They sold goods at a lower markup than specialty stores 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	3
Two days a week, Kevin leaves his office 45 minutes early to take charge of his 2-year-old daughter, Sophie, while her mother, a university professor, teaches a late class. [SEP] One balmy spring afternoon, Kevin retrieved Sophie at her child-care center and	drove	the 15-minute route home. [SEP] Invited to look in on Sophie’s play, I met the pair at the front door and nestled into a rocking chair from which to observe unobtrusively. [SEP] After downing the last bite of her snack, Sophie grabbed Kevin’s hand and led him across the family room to a rug lined on two sides by shelves ﬁlled with books, stuffed animals, and other play props. [SEP] Sophie moved a toy horse and cow inside a small, enclosed fence that she and Kevin had put together the day before. [SEP] Then she turned the animals on their sides and moved them toward each other.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	3
itution, the implications run through all relationships that may come into being. [SEP] This “third-party effect” means that private individuals are bound to respect the human dignity in each other, precisely as they are bound not to subject each other to relationships of involuntary servitude or, during Prohibition, not to sell each other alcoholic beverages. [SEP] Today, men and women must avoid sexual harassment on the job, even though in this case the “third-party” effect arises not directly from the Constitution but from federal legislation. [SEP] An activist tripartite conception of government requires funding. [SEP] Fighting a major military campaign to suppress the Southern insurrection required a stronger financial base than the government had needed up to that time. [SEP] The war	drove	up spending from the customary 2 percent of the gross national product to 15 percent. [SEP] (By comparison, in the early 1990s, government spending represented 20 percent of the GNP.)5 With no place left to turn, a Republican Congress approved the first income tax in 1862. [SEP] By 1865, the income tax generated over 20 percent of federal revenue, the balance coming from tariffs and reintroduced excise taxes. [SEP] The Civil War income tax lapsed in 1872, and when the direct tax against income returned to the national agenda in the 1890s, the times were different. [SEP] The disputes took on the tones of class struggle. [SEP] This time, it was the Democrats who favored the tax as a measure of social justice.

nt to the national government, as opposed to states, or to the national territory as opposed to local geographical units. [SEP] In this limited sense, the “nation” is constituted by a federal government in Washington or by a physical space staked out on maps and recognized by other countries. [SEP] The nation is then equivalent to the Union or the federal government. [SEP] But the issue is not the authority of the “national” government in contrast to states’ rights. [SEP] The derivative sense of nationhood as denoting “unified at a federal level” is surely present as a subsidiary meaning in Lincoln’s invocation of the term, but this could not possibly be all that he meant to say. [SEP] The American nation, as it existed in 1863, was a nation in the European sense. [SEP] The assumption that	drove	the movements of national unification on the continent was that each nation should be able to govern itself. [SEP] And self-government requires that each nation should be able to constitute itself as a state. [SEP] If this was the thrust of mid-century European history, the same was to be expected of the immigrant nation of the United States. [SEP] . . . a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. [SEP] Thus ends the remarkable first sentence of the address. [SEP] The nation of which we speak is immediately qualified. [SEP] This is not simply a nation of common lineage—an extension of tribal identity. [SEP] We are indeed different from the European nations, for our nation is born of an idea.

 toward the Confederate men in arms who, in Lincoln’s view, never ceased to be part of the American nation. [SEP] This was a war between brothers. [SEP] It was necessary to settle the inevitable family quarrel about the kind of nation the United States would become. [SEP] As American history took its course in the decades that followed the “war for the nation,” we managed to betray the inner meaning of the great sacrifice that Lincoln sought to consecrate at Gettysburg. [SEP] We absorbed the war into the preexisting political and legal vocabulary. [SEP] We could have celebrated a new vocabulary of politics—a vocabulary we shared with Europeans who were then moving toward nation-states of internal solidarity. [SEP] And, yet, we ignored the appeal of the new for the sake of the old. [SEP] We	drove	the solidarity of Gettysburg underground. [SEP] We converted the ideas that should have become our new activist national charter into our passive Secret Constitution. [SEP] The issues that concerned postbellum America were not the ideas of solidarity and reconciliation that Lincoln managed to articulate both at Gettysburg and in his second inaugural address. [SEP] With the assassination in April 1865 of the man who had preached a new order of ideas, the United States became a country obsessed with power. [SEP] The great issues of the postbellum period breathed the tensions of institutional conflict.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	3
Equality And equality—that glaring omission from our original Constitution? [SEP] How did the Fourteenth Amendment’s attempt to rectify the sins of 1787 fare in the grip of the antebellum intuitions that	drove	the Miller court? [SEP] The five majority justices could have applied the “equal protection” clause and achieved the same result that Justice Field had engineered under his construction of the dual tracks of citizenship: the butchers rendered dependent on the Crescent City Company were subject, they could easily have concluded, to impermissible discrimination. [SEP] That would not have been a particularly radical result, and it would have established an enduring commitment to equality under the postbellum constitution. [SEP] But no, the Court turned away from the larger issue of principle for the sake of overcoming a narrow historical injustice. [SEP] The “evil to be remedied by this [equal protection] clause,” the Court writes, was “the existence of laws in the States where the newly emanc	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	3
ationhood and the commitment to equality into constitutional discourse, the Civil Rights Cases completed the process of driving Lincoln’s vision into the deep structure of our constitutional thought. [SEP] The Court generated a surface discourse to camouflage the Secret Constitution. [SEP] It bequeathed to us a narrow conception of state action that we are still struggling to overcome. [SEP] And, more to the point, by undermining federal authority to remove the incidents and marks of slavery, the Court facilitated segregation in American society. [SEP] It would be a mere dozen or so years until the Supreme Court upheld the idea that public facilities, including schools, might be “separate but equal”—thus institutionalizing apartheid for generations.53 [SEP] At the same time that the courts	drove	the postbellum legal order underground, concerted action by the children of slave owners organized to frustrate the purposes of the Fifteenth Amendment. [SEP] Various measures, including poll taxes, literacy tests, and organized violence, were used to prevent African Americans from realizing their right to vote. [SEP] The Democratic Party gained the loyalty of white Southern voters and remained in power for more than half a century, largely on the basis of segregationist principles.54 [SEP] Yet, there is an important difference between the courts’ betraying the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments and the people’s frustrating the purposes of the Fifteenth Amendment.

You see the analogy to chemistry. [SEP] The transformation of the lisp expression to a new lisp expression is rather like a chemical reaction. [SEP] The operating lisp expression that does the transformation is rather like an enzyme catalyzing a reaction. [SEP] So Walter let loose a pot full of 10,000 lisp expressions in a computer. [SEP] These merrily bumped into one another creating new lisp expressions. [SEP] Walter, as a good theoretical chemist from the Eigen-Schuster tradition, imagined his algorithmic chemistry in a “chemostat” that would hold the total number of lisp expressions at a constant 10,000. [SEP] So if extra lisp expressions	drove	the total above 10,000, Walter randomly chose enough lisp expressions to eliminate from the pot to keep the total at 10,000. [SEP] This pruning back to a total of 10,000 provides a selection pressure for lisp expressions that are formed more often than average. [SEP] Walter let loose the floodgates of his alchemical world. [SEP] A torrent of ever new lisp expressions, then, stunningly, a few, then more often, one sees an enlarging population of a subset of already-seen lisp expressions.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	3
 the persistent coming into existence of new goods and services and extinction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. [SEP] In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. [SEP] We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. [SEP] We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. [SEP] And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera. [SEP] But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. [SEP] Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile	drove	the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. [SEP] With the horse went the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. [SEP] With the car came paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. [SEP] The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. [SEP] One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. [SEP] More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? [SEP] Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes.

Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral in Scranton, Pennsylvania, but he never explained what broke the spell and led him to a more abstract style. [SEP] Like any successful architect, Hood had a strong sense of his changing time. [SEP] It is easy to misunderstand the nature of that change. [SEP] The abstraction that characterizes the Daily News Building and the RCA Building has little to do with new technology or changing functions. [SEP] Those buildings are not any more “modern” than the Chicago Tribune tower, which had gargoyles and flying buttresses but was an advanced building in terms of planning and technology. [SEP] Indeed, Hood’s Gothic design was more functionally advanced than Eliel Saarinen’s stylistically progressive second-place entry. [SEP] It was not commodity and firmness that	drove	the changing aesthetic, but fashion. [SEP] The public had a taste for simpler, forward-looking design, of which the International Style was but one expression. [SEP] Art Deco, streamlined modern, and stripped Classicism were evidence of the same changing taste. [SEP] Many industrial products of the 1930s displayed the same chic simplicity: Raymond Loewy’s curvilinear Coldspot refrigerator, Walter Dorwin Teague’s popular Kodak Brownie camera, Henry Dreyfuss’ Bell telephone, Loewy’s redesigned Coca-Cola bottle and the sleek Zippo cigarette lighter. [SEP] The medieval inventors of the Gothic style were likewise influenced by fashion.
