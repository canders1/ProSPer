Sequels: none Noir and I	arrived	one day later, the day before Alice was to turn 13, at the orders of the Queen of Midnight to escort her heir to the Night Palace. [SEP] Unfortunately, there were complications that we didn’t anticipate, such as the fact that her parents weren’t thrilled at having their daughter as the heir to one of the Nights. [SEP] They had already petitioned Noon about the decision, and even though Noon had said that there was absolutely nothing they could do about it, that still didn’t stop her mother from slamming the door in our faces as soon as she saw our Raven wings. [SEP] For a while there was the sound of yelling and doors slamming, and then an entourage of hansom cabs drove up the road, containing Noon and his escort. [SEP] They were quickly admitted to the house, while Noir and I had the pleas	#ficlets#	ficlets_1401.txt	arrive	written	masc_written	3
Sequels: 45835 “Its gonna be just fine, hun,” my mother insited on the way to my new school. [SEP] I bet you heard this a million times before, i just came to a new town, blah blah, new school, no friends, but i felt like the town of Marzark was way different than the others. [SEP] After I	arrived	to my dreadful destination I was quickly settled in and rushed into my homeroom. [SEP] “Is he the new kid?”... “He’s cute.” ... “Oh, new kid.” [SEP] Is all I heard while sitting and all eyes were on me. [SEP] But who’s complaining? [SEP] “Hi, I’m Jared.” [SEP] He stretched out his arm, apparently wanting me to shake it. [SEP] I just looked at him, and we both laughed. [SEP] Who shakes hands? [SEP] Its too formal. [SEP] After that everything else went great. [SEP] Jared introduced me to a lot of new friends and some really cool people. [SEP] I was actually starting to love school! [SEP] Well, so far anyway. [SEP] I kept looking for some flaw, but nothing seemed to come up. [SEP] This school was just too perfect!

Sequels: 45855 “I’ll be right back,” I said softly to the injured angel. [SEP] The Bonesetter would know what to do. [SEP] I stood and ran briskly across the field to the road. [SEP] The Bonesetter lived not far away from my house, in a once-colorful gypsy caravan where he did his work. [SEP] As a child, I had been terrified of the caravan, partly because the Bonesetter growled and snapped at the village children, but also because of the blood-curdling screams that came from inside when people were having their broken bones set, so they would heal properly. [SEP] Breathless, I	arrived	at the caravan door, and knocked sharply upon it. [SEP] I knew that the Bonesetter would not answer unless it was an emergency, so I kept knocking until he opened the door and snarled, “What is it you want that you must make such a racket on my door?” “You must come,” I said, gasping. [SEP] “It’s hurt.” “I don’t treat animals,” he said, starting to close the door. [SEP] I put my foot in the way. [SEP] “It’s not an animal,” I said. [SEP] “It’s an angel.” [SEP] Awakening	#ficlets#	ficlets_1403.txt	arrive	written	masc_written	3

Alice smiled. [SEP] "I'm going hunting with you!" [SEP] Jake, though he had many reservations about this, reluctantly decided to take her along. [SEP] Later they	arrived	at the hunting site. [SEP] Jake set his wife safely up in the tree stand and told her, "If you see a deer, take careful aim and I'll come running back as soon as I hear the shot." [SEP] Jake walked away with a smile on his face knowing that Alice couldn't bag an elephant, much less a deer. [SEP] Not 10 minutes passed when he was startled as he heard an array of gunshots.	#jokes#	jokes_jokes15.txt	arrive	written	masc_written	3
