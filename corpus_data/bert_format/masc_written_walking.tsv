Sequels: 45734 “I trust you had a safe flight, dismal as the airline was?” [SEP] I nodded. [SEP] “How can you tell that?” “I could tell the moment you walked in. Not only was the dust on your shoes suggestive, but you smell faintly of jet fuel & inferior peanuts. That, & your boarding pass is sticking out of your pocket with the airline’s name facing out.” [SEP] I laughed. [SEP] “Was it really that easy?” “Of course.” “Can you tell anything else?” [SEP] She studied me intently once more. [SEP] I’d have to get used to that. [SEP] “Well, you’ve been well off; have been	walking	a great deal as of late; are a frequent writer and are a lefty. That’s all I can tell.” [SEP] I nearly fell out of my chair. [SEP] “How...?” “Not many ‘lower’ people, including myself, going around wearing a Rolex like that. I could see your shoes have been worn a few milimeters, but the canvas is fairly new. As far as the writing goes, you’ve a considerable amout of ink & graphite on the side of your left hand.” “You’re a genius!” [SEP] I cried. [SEP] She shook her head & smiled.

ss, but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared. [SEP] I walked across what had been the dance floor. [SEP] The church was completely different now: sunlight fell through the stained glass, catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry, healthy warmth into the edges of the room, through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights. [SEP] I realized that Rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and I had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up – which, if she were in a situation where I should be doing something, would probably be never. [SEP] Standing in the center of the church, I took out my cell phone and called the police. [SEP] “I need to file a missing persons report. …Rachel Frieze. Last night,	walking	on West 2nd street around – maybe eleven or twelve o’clock. What? …But, sir, this is an unusual situation. She didn’t come home last night, none of her friends have seen her. …Sir, if she’s in any danger, it will probably be too late to help her by that time. My girlfriend has disappeared, I don’t even know where to start looking, and I need help! …Yes, sir. I understand.” [SEP] The police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight. [SEP] I closed the phone. [SEP] Walking out of the church, a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise. [SEP] A cold front must have hit while I was inside. [SEP] Glancing down the street, I realized that I didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time, and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran. [SEP] I pulled my T-shi	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	walk	written	masc_written	2
“Just ignore that,” he told me. [SEP] “You’ll be used to the sensation in a moment.” [SEP] That just unnerved me more. [SEP] As we kept driving, the anxiety grew more pronounced. [SEP] I noticed that there were some people on the street, people the same color as the soiled buildings. [SEP] Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes. [SEP] “Okay, this is the spot,” said my driver, pulling over. [SEP] He parked and got out. [SEP] “Is it really safe to leave the car …” he was already	walking	toward the squat, brick-windowed building we were parked next to. [SEP] Glancing back at that gleaming glare, I decided that it might be safer to follow the driver than to wait with the car. [SEP] I hopped out, ran after him, and reached him just as he was knocking on the door. [SEP] Someone opened it a crack, then ushered us in. [SEP] Inside, the building opened up. [SEP] The ceiling was high and wooden, and I could see part of a DJ’s booth down the hall. [SEP] It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub. [SEP] Then I looked down and saw what had let us in. [SEP] “Nepthys, my man! What up?” [SEP] The hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap. [SEP] “Nice, my man,” he said as they clasped hands. [SEP] “Who’s the freak?”	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	walk	written	masc_written	2
n we parked. [SEP] I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through – people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them, and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail. [SEP] The yellow of this sky wasn’t just smog: it had a leeching, heavy dimness. [SEP] I saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light. [SEP] A corpulent, batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle. [SEP] Leaning from the rough-hewn window of one building on our right was something with long, green hair draped across the seven gangly arms hanging from its windowsill. [SEP] Thirty-five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed. [SEP] I noticed when my back hit the wall that I was	walking	backwards. [SEP] “We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,” said my driver. [SEP] I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills. [SEP] “We interact with humans, take advantage of them, grant them boons, sometimes even become their friends, but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction. [SEP] At this point, we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional.	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	walk	written	masc_written	2
Holding Dvorov’s directions, Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway. [SEP] I started wondering again how reliable my guide’s credentials were. [SEP] Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other, he did not inspire confidence. [SEP] “Just at this corner,” he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east. East is that way.” [SEP] He pointed at the wall to our right. [SEP] “Don’t let the sun fool you. Then I’m going to shed a little blood, but don’t worry, none of yours.” [SEP] I blinked at him, but he just kept	walking	until we reached the corner. [SEP] “Okay, you might feel silly, but just turn three times to your left. Try to keep in time with me.” [SEP] We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust. [SEP] The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back. [SEP] When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner. [SEP] Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening the door. [SEP] “Are you coming?” [SEP] We slipped through the door and came out, not inside the building, but on a busy street in a completely different part of town. [SEP] The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere th	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	walk	written	masc_written	2

Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant, then all went numb. [SEP] Taste, hearing and touch became a single blur, and I do not know if my eyes were open. [SEP] My mind began to dissipate, but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said, “This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking.” [SEP] Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack. [SEP] I must have fallen to the floor then. [SEP] I could perceive Nepthys’ sword flashing over me, and I heard steel crack, then bone. [SEP] I thought I heard Rachel’s voice blearily calling for me. [SEP] Then one set of footsteps began	walking	toward the altar. [SEP] I was content to let myself drift away, and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral’s hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek. [SEP] A girl’s voice, soft and almost recognizable, spoke, “Nathan.” [SEP] I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected. [SEP] Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me the hammer and stake.	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	walk	written	masc_written	2

[SEP] I stood and turned toward the altar. [SEP] The vampire was	walking	just steps ahead of me. I stepped up behind him and raised my hands, which almost seemed to be glowing. [SEP] Then the stake came down into his back and one, two, three strikes with the hammer drove it in. [SEP] The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth. [SEP] Behind me, Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys, whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug. [SEP] I pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar.	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	walk	written	masc_written	2
It was evening, and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last. [SEP] Passionate, fiery colors filled the western sky before him, though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead. [SEP] As Allan drew closer, he distinguished a new cloud, a pillar rising directly ahead; a road of smoke ascended in the west, its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door. [SEP] Allan's thoughts fled as one, scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume. [SEP] He ran the last distance, crested the hill puffing to reveal Arthur below,	walking	to the carriage parked before Allan's house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto the vehicle's roof. [SEP] Arthur paused in the door, looking up at Allan for a moment; then he turned and shut the door behind him. [SEP] The driver snapped the reins and set the horses on. [SEP] As they trotted forth, Allan's eyes remained trapped by the carriage, following it up the hillock and past himself. [SEP] The heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows. [SEP] He watched as the carriage drew still more distant, the horses' hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway. [SEP] When they had gone, he remained, stunned, until the scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself.

The word zoot was known within the urban jazz culture of Harlem, and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style. [SEP] Many African Americans wore an extravagant style of clothing, the baggy pegged pants and jackets with padded shoulders, that later became known as the zoot suit. [SEP] In the novel Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison, he describes the zoot--suiters’ style, “	walking	slowly, their shoulders swaying, their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles; their coats long and hip-tight with shoulders far too broad to be those of natural western men” (1947, 380). [SEP] In the late-night jazz scenes of Harlem this style was “a killer-diller coat with a drape-shape, reat-pleats and shoulders padded like a lunatic’s cell” (380). [SEP] Tyler makes the point that the zoot suit was an extremely symbolic costume, which gave the wearer the look of a child in adult clothing. [SEP] The broad square shoulders gave a macho look to the youth, and the finger-tipped coat was made for fun and leisure. [SEP] The long baggy pants were made for dancing, especially the jitterbug, and the wide Panama hats were another 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_chZ.txt	walk	written	masc_written	2
