The competition was required to move for 2011 because of the ongoing rehabilitation of the Mall. As a result, getting to the Solar Decathlon will take a bit more planning this year. Organizers will run a shuttle from the Smithsonian Metro stop every 15 minutes between 9:30 am and 3:30 pm on weekdays and from 9:30 am and 6:30 pm on weekends. Be warned however, that it will be crowded! Alternatively, you could	walk	the approximately 1.3 miles from the Smithsonian Metro Station or 1.5 miles from the Farragut West Metro Station (each way). But, don't even think about driving!	natural	natural	natural	CORE; Other; Best way to get to the Solar Decathlon: On a Bike!; http://www.waba.org/blog/2011/09/best-way-to-get-to-the-solar-decathlon-on-a-bike/	1	none	listener	West Potomac Park
