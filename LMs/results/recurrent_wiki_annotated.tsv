The discovery alerted authorities to an ancient mound that had been flattened by millennia of plowing, and which was subsequently excavated by the Canterbury Archaeological Trust.

Seeing it on the mannequin, I ’ d had a visual image of myself lying on my back with the coat ’ s sleeves crossed over my chest like a sarcophagus. Envisioning it had made me totally peaceful.	annotated	natural	natural	COCA; 2018; Vol. 126, Iss. 4, Cass and Charlene	1	think	speaker	out
