After class, I tell Edwin I'll catch him at home because I'm staying after. He says okay and then kisses my cheek quickly. I felt nothing, as if he were a grandma who has kissed my cheek a thousand times.<n>Seconds after Edwin was out of sight, Chris walks up. He smiles that million dollar smile of his and I feel my insides melt. Immediately warning bells go off in my head. It is not good that Edwin does nothing for me with a kiss and Chris does everything with just a smile.<n>"Ready to go?"? He asks. I can't remember how to talk so I just kind of stare at him.

The girl says before leaving."This is amazing guys!"? Amber gushes."Fer sure!"? I say."It's just a little something."? Ashton replies, looking a little embarrassed. Just then a very professional looking waiter walks up to our table. I stifle a laugh as I see a white napkin draped over his arm."Hello."?
