C's and D's, you know, and that's just not me. I wish if I could do it all over again I would stay home and study instead of	going	out with my friends, which has really hurt me a lot. [SEP] Do you think that's what it was?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Yeah. [SEP] So you're just	going	to work a lot harder? [SEP] Work a lot harder, um, take some classes that I think are	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So you're just	going	to work a lot harder? [SEP] Work a lot harder, um, take some classes that I think are	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
That's pretty much it. [SEP] I'm just	going	to tell everybody that they need to study! [SEP] Definitely study!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
OK. [SEP] Um, we're	going	to talk about today childhood stories and what I'm wondering is what are the stories you remember as children? [SEP] I recall, a number of stories.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
But I think the story that was, was a favorite was one that my mother made up herself, utilizing characters from, you know, like Bugs Bunny and, and Thumper and Bambi and all that. [SEP] And ah, she, she made it up, a story about a, me and my cousin Phil, ah,	going	on this trip to the Canadian Northwest to hunt and meeting these little characters, uh, while we were there. [SEP] Of course it can't be published because all those things are copyrighted, but my mother made up the story and I thought it was very nice and I still have it, uh, handwritten, uh, in our file here.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Go ahead. [SEP] Well, I'm	going	to ask a final question that, um, I mean, you're my parents, and you imparted a lot of, uh, a lot of the love of reading to me. [SEP] Uh, how important it was to read and we're all English majors, I think that has something to do with it; my brother, sister and I are all, we're all English majors in college.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Uh, how important it was to read and we're all English majors, I think that has something to do with it; my brother, sister and I are all, we're all English majors in college. [SEP] So, what I am	going	to ask you is what was your philosophy behind that? [SEP] Why is reading so important?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
At about, about three weeks later, then arrived a group of about four, at my brother's house, and told him, that they were coming to, to be, that is to take control of the place, where we lived. [SEP] Well, but that they weren't	going	to steal, they weren't	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Then when, well, since I lived alone, only with my son, they, would seek me out because, I always had, everything, because I had all kinds of animals, including doves from Castile, uh, turkeys, ducks, hens, pigs, cows, all kinds of animals. [SEP] So they would, they would always come to me, and they told me, "Ma'am, sell us milk, sell us yogurt, sell us cheese, or sell us a, a hog, a plump hog, well I had to sell them, and I am	going	to sell," he'd said, "if you sell them to everyone else, sell to us, too." [SEP] I say to him, "OK."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So, he, he came looking for, yogurt, I don't know what he came looking for, for me to sell him. [SEP] And when I was giving it to him, he said to me, "There's	going	to be, a meeting now." "When?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
"In Piedras de Sal," that was, like a, pretty, level, place where, they gathered. [SEP] And I said to him, "I'm not	going	to be able to go." "Why?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I said to him, "But you know, I'm your friend, tell me why." [SEP] Then he said to me that, "they're	going	to set up a board," he said to me, "where they're	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And I said to him, "And what is that for?" "Because they're	going	to set up a committee," he said to me, "so that when those big battalions," he said to me, "of guerrillas arrive, these people attend, for example, the president is	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
"Yes," he said. [SEP] So, I said, "No," I said, "I'm not	going	to be able to go." [SEP] He said, "But, don't you ever tell, that I told you, because-," he said.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He said, "But, don't you ever tell, that I told you, because-," he said. [SEP] He motioned to me as if they were	going	to cut off his head. [SEP] I said, "No, I'm not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

So, the next day, I left early in the morning for San Miguel, to see my daughter, and when I was coming back, I went by my brother's, which was a place in, a town called Chapeltique, and I arrived at his place, and I said, his name is Salomon, and I said, "Brother, I am here to see if you'll give me posada (lodging)," we call it, like you give someone a place to live in your own house. [SEP] And he said, "What's	going	on?" [SEP] I said, "Nothing, it's just that, I don't want to be there any longer," I said, "Look, it's just that I have lots of problems with the animals, I don't even have a pasture."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
"Nothing," he said, "Why?" "I was	going	to bother you," I said (), "so you come with me," I say, "I want you to do me a favor." "Uh-huh?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
You suggest something. [SEP] " "OK," he said, "Let me, wait for me here, I'm	going	to let dad know, and Cristobal's neighbors' friends. [SEP] " And he left, and that's how it was.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And he left, and that's how it was. [SEP] When he came back, he said, "Yes," so, he said, "I'm	going	to leave here," he said, "from your house for Chapeltique at four in the morning with the livestock." [SEP] And that's how it was, he left, at dawn, and he said, "See you there," and he left with the, with the livestock, with the, and the, the others who were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
When he came back, he said, "Yes," so, he said, "I'm	going	to leave here," he said, "from your house for Chapeltique at four in the morning with the livestock."

They hid and, the soldiers came to the house. [SEP] It was, when the first one arrived, the first soldier, and he said, "Er, ma'am, make," he said, "some four, six rations," he said, "because plenty of soldiers have come, and I'm	going	to inform the other houses." [SEP] I stayed, making the rations of food when a group of soldiers arrives, and when I was, fixing the food, in the kitchen, because of the sun, because of the reflection of the sun, I saw, a weapon pointing at me, so that was when I said to him, "What happened?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And then the soldiers would pass through just the same. [SEP] So you couldn't tell what kind, at night, what kind of people were	going	by, but you could hear clatter, because even beasts full of weapons, with, everything, you know? [SEP] So that time, that I told you about when the, the soldiers came, my son escaped, dying, from fear, when I go that they had me at gunpoint, and they surrounded the house, but it passed, they didn't do anything.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
The next time the soldiers, came through, the guerrillas were in front of the house, in the road, there's one, of those huge rocks, that you can sit on, and when they were eating. [SEP] When all of a sudden, a girl went by, I was washing (clothes), a girl went by, and she told me she was	going	to here mom's, her name is Victoria. [SEP] And when, the guerrillas, ah, well, the girl went by and very shortly she came back.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Red-faced, tired, and red-faced, the man, and on the other side, the other end of the house, there were two others, shooting, so that, also, also stretched out on the ground. [SEP] Then I said, "Dear Lord," I said, "what are we	going	to do about this?" [SEP] Well, they went through, they broke a soldier's leg, you could hear his moaning.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And that's the way it stayed, the firefights there, in that place, and the firefights. [SEP] Well, one day, I sai, I was	going	from San Miguel, uh, to Carolina, my brother lived, my brother was the principal of that, of that school there, in Carolina. [SEP] He worked, he's a teacher, and at that time he worked as the principal of that school, of that school, because it was a, like a high school, there was, from first (grade) to high school.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He worked, he's a teacher, and at that time he worked as the principal of that school, of that school, because it was a, like a high school, there was, from first (grade) to high school. [SEP] So, early that morning, that afternoon, I came down from San Miguel, and I told him, "I'm	going	to go." [SEP] He says, "Don't go.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
They're making trincheras," they call them trincheras, where they're putting mounds of stones near the houses, so that the bullets there. He says, "And it's	going	to be very dangerous and it's very late. [SEP] " So, I said to him, "Oh, well, I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He says, "And it's	going	to be very dangerous and it's very late." [SEP] So, I said to him, "Oh, well, I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Well, he milked the cow every morning, but that day, he couldn't milk her, because the gunfire was so heavy, and because everything was falling near the house. [SEP] So, my brother said, "I'm	going	to cut her rope, I'm not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So, my brother said, "I'm	going	to cut her rope, I'm not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Only Luis Alonso had gone out. [SEP] Well, nobody noticed my brother until he said, "Vieja (Old lady)," he said, because that's how they talked to each other, "Vieja," he said, "I may be	going	to die," and we turned him around to see what the, the. [SEP] He had a pillow, one of those big pillows, and it looked red, all of it with blood and swollen like this	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
she said to them, to the guerrillas, "Bastards!" she said to them, "because of you we're	going	to die too, through no fault of our own!" she said.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
They didn't answer. [SEP] She closed the door, and Ines said to me, "What are we	going	to do with Luis Alonso?" [SEP] Now we, now we didn't, we didn't pay attention to the kids, we had forgotten about the kids, we were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

I've come to see Luis Alonso," he says. Because, well, no, Ines was putting up an argument that-, when he told her, "No," he said, e, Luis Alonso, "I may be	going	to die," he said, "because so much blood loss," he said. "No," he said, "I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

And they put out the, the word that yes, they had killed him. [SEP] So, and if another, another person did that, they were	going	to kill him too. [SEP] Because, there were a lot more things.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
When, um, I was little, I lived more, near Lake Norman side of Charlotte. [SEP] If you're not from Charlotte, you're not	going	to know where that's at, but, um, it was really far away from everybody and behind the airport and stuff like that. [SEP] And, um, my junior year of high sch, high school, we moved into like the city, the west side of Charlotte, and I went to West Meck, and that was a, um, culture experience, \\ I guess \\.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Because like he saw that like, I think he saw that I was like him before I would admit that I was like him. [SEP] Because he knew that I was	going	to do what I wanted to do without disrespecting my parents or do anything like that because I was still like not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And `cause I was really involved in theater and stuff in high school and everything like that. [SEP] And kind of like coming in to college or whatever, he kind of convinced me that what else am I	going	to do? [SEP] Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Uh-huh. [SEP] If I, he's like, "You're not	going	to do anything, da-da-da." [SEP] He wasn't real supportive about it at all.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Then they got the whole schedule thing for the next year with the tuition bill on it and everything like that and my mom was reading it and it said, "Major THEA," and she was like, "What is this?" [SEP] She knew I was	going	to do it, but Dad was pretty irate. [SEP] Then I started paying him half the tuition bill.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
That's probably why I'm a theater major so I can kind of, you know, do what plays I want and then move on. [SEP] Do you think they've become more ex, do you think they've accepted more what you've decided to do or that's	going	to take a while? [SEP] Or if they ever will at all?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
To have something to fall back on and everything like that. [SEP] And I'm like, I'm trying to convince him to, you know, if I don't make it and there's a strong possibility I won't, I know that, I'm not stupid, I'm nor	going	to go to L.A. and make five million or more than that-- Right.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Right. [SEP] And do all that, and I mean, if I don't make it, my life's not	going	to be over or something, like I can't go back to school. [SEP] So you'll go back to school if that doesn't work out?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And stuff like that. [SEP] I'm kind of	going	to do what I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I love it! [SEP] I do, but it gets to a point where like I feel like if I fail, it's just	going	to be like way too much for everybody. [SEP] And, I don't know, it's like my grandparents, I'm the youngest one.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Uh-huh. [SEP] So nobody knows what they're	going	to be yet and considering Chris is raising them, that doesn't, you know, say too much for them two little girls. [SEP] Whose girls?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

You can't go into it and be like, "Oh! I'm	going	to be a big movie star one day!" and everything like that, because the people like that are the ones that are disappointed the most and then like end up nowhere.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
That's a good attitude! [SEP] Well, I definitely think you're	going	to do something with it and I want to thank you for talking to us. [SEP] No problem!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Do you think there'll be a very big culture shock? [SEP] I don't know that it will be a very big culture shock, because I've grown up	going	to Boston all the time. [SEP] So it's almost like a second home.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, I'll definitely be ready for the change. [SEP] I've been	going	up as a progress in school, so I, it will be a good change for me. [SEP] So you'll stay here for the four years and then move, or would you transfer schools?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Although I do enjoy Spring and March here. [SEP] How was it	going	to high school in Charlotte? [SEP] Do you feel like, do you think it would have been different if you had gone to school in Boston or someplace else up north?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
For North Carolina? [SEP] They say we're	going	up in the mountains to find some snow. [SEP] Really?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeIII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

We'd basically coasted down into town and got about 50 gallons of kerosene and pumped it in the fuel tank so that so that the fuel would actually run through the fuel lines and the bus would run.

[SEP] Chased him all the way up to the upstairs, I don't think the bird ever even pooped in the house not that we found--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And um, Grandma, my grandmother, their mother, was walking with them that night. [SEP] She was	going	to watch TV. [SEP] And uh, it was dark, they really couldn't see.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BranchElbert.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Umm, go ahead and tell me about a story. [SEP] Well I can remember as a small child probably between the ages of three and seven	going	to Asheville and visiting my grandmother umm and my grandfather but he died when I was fairly young so I mostly remember visiting my grandmother. [SEP] She lived in a small house in Asheville.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CaseCullen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I don't know those are the, the sort of stick out in my mind about visiting Asheville. [SEP] Um we always tended to stop somewhere scenic either	going	to or coming from. [SEP] We went to Chimney Rock on a number of occasions.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CaseCullen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And uh mostly because my dad, my dad's side of the family were Southern Baptists from the mountains of North Carolina, my mom was a Catholic from California which, oh, just scared everybody right there. [SEP] So, before she even had the opportunity to meet my mom she had already decided that she was this, this evil heathen creature that was	going	to corrupt her beautiful boy um and even wrote her a nasty letter to that effect. [SEP] Um, she pretty much showed a lot of disinterest at best and, and outright hostility at worst towards my mom until we the kids came along.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CaseCullen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
You're not	going	to hear yourself on the tape. [SEP] ( ) OK go ahead.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
( ) OK go ahead. [SEP] OK Adam is now	going	to talk about the music industry.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So I was able to get out into the actual music industry the recording industry and, unfortunately, one aspect of the recording industry, when you get started, a lot of times you have to do either very low-paying or non-paying internships to get into the recording studio. [SEP] Specifically, I mean, if you want to work at, work at one of these places, they, they, uh, generally have a lot of free help, so, uh, you're not	going	to make a whole lot of money doing this and they expect you to put in a full time schedule so you really can't work another job. [SEP] But at any rate, I had this, this freedom and, um, the girl had come into my life to, to go and pursue this dream, so, um, I started working at place called D&D Studios, which was known for doing, um, a lot of hip hop music, kind of stuff similar to what I was interested in and I was hoping I'd be able to make some, some connections at least, maybe do a little bit of networking there, and, uh, I met some pretty cool people, did some really kind of really interesting projects, um, but--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It was really dirty and had a reputation as being such, um, kind of a grungy atmosphere, environment, but where you could do what you wanted to do and get stuff done and what have you. [SEP] From there that was kind of frustrating me a little bit,	going	into, um, sessions every day or every night and having 15 people around me smoking fat blunts, drinking forties of Old English, and really not getting a whole lot of stuff done that was, it was, it was just depressing. [SEP] And, uh, seeing people with no real creative potential getting paid to do music wasn't very encouraging or inspiring to me.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
, you know, basically crossing paths on the way out as, as Kim was coming in and get to work stay at work until five a.m. come home as Kim was getting up and getting ready for work, go to sleep, she goes to work, I wake up, eat, shower and all that good stuff, and then, uh, she's coming home and I'm	going	out again. [SEP] After doing that for a couple of weeks it's kind of like, "Damn," you know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
OK. [SEP] What stories do you tell yourself to keep	going	through hard times? [SEP] Funny, sad, whatever.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Uh, we hadn't been married long and, and we were driving down the road one day. [SEP] I saw a box in the middle of the road, you know, and I looked over at him and, you know, men always automatically, you can just see them lining up like they're	going	to hit that, you know? [SEP] Yep.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
' And he said, "I couldn't, it was like interstate and I couldn't, could not move over either way. I knew I was	going	to run over it." [SEP] And he said, "I thought, `Now just wait and see if it does anything.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He, um, we were in CA, and we had been in San Francisco for about three days and this is my first trip to CA. [SEP] And I was just fascinated with the big city: San Francisco life, so many cars and, and the day that we were	going	the shuttle bus was taking us back to um, the airport: LAX. [SEP] We were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And I was just fascinated with the big city: San Francisco life, so many cars and, and the day that we were	going	the shuttle bus was taking us back to um, the airport: LAX. [SEP] We were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Everything, you know? [SEP] Because you'd hear furniture crashing, but I can remember we went straight over to the window and we still had power, but we went straight to the window and it was just, I honestly, I think, thought we were	going	to die. [SEP] All right, you could see transformers popping everywhere!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I'd see film clips on TV where like a policeman got killed. [SEP] He was	going	across the bridge and, you know, it was so foggy he didn't know the bridge was out and it was just there, you know, and the entire surrounding area around us was like that. [SEP] There were bridges out, just, and not necessarily just a bridge.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
There were bridges out, just, and not necessarily just a bridge. [SEP] Just, all of a sudden there would be a sinkhole in the middle of the highway and cars were just	going	down into it, you know, that didn't know that it was there. [SEP] So if it hadn't been for that guy and that radio, we would never have made it to the airport.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
That's right. [SEP] And I thought, "No security patrol's	going	to be out here." [SEP] But uh, you know, my and, and, when I got out there to where the little dock was at for the paper, I could see my van.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
But uh, you know, my and, and, when I got out there to where the little dock was at for the paper, I could see my van. [SEP] I parked right beside this great big tree, and all that while I worried about my van, but not enough to where I was	going	to go out there and move it. [SEP] You know?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I'm like, "Nice try, Richard but my van is fine. I've been	going	over there all night long." [SEP] Been checking.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
"Get under the bed!" [SEP] Mike	going	to say, "Get under the bed!" [SEP] Right.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And we'd sit there and just watch. [SEP] But now I wasn't stupid or nothing when the lights were	going	`shz, shz,' you know, but she's, "Get under the bed!" in her bedroom.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
in her bedroom. [SEP] She's got one of those tall four-poster beds, like that w as	going	to save us, but we had to get under there a lot when I was growing up, bad storms-- Yeah.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Absolutely. [SEP] And I'm afraid that all of them are	going	to be like him in the area. [SEP] I mean, at least it's not, nobody likes to read like I do.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And if she reads a one-point book and takes a test on it, she misses a question, she gets point-nine. [SEP] The reading another one point book, she's	going	to get, say she gets a 100 on it, she's still only got one-point-nine and she had to have two points. [SEP] So, every week it seems like I have to go to the library and get these little point-five books as, I call them "fillers," just to fill in.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He said, "I promise you that I could stand outside in this yard and look across the harbor where you can see the whole bay area," and he said, "If it was quiet enough, you could swear you could hear champagne glasses clinking together." [SEP] Your, I guess your imagination, you know, what all	going	on there, you know. [SEP] Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um-hum. [SEP] But it's always something	going	on. [SEP] And, you know, it's just the culture and I'm always thinking, you know, it's not, at least they're not expecting, they are providing you some type of entertainment; they're doing something, you know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
That's neat. [SEP] Yeah, just, it's just really nice to see all those things	going	on. [SEP] I can remember this guy standing there and he had this little dog.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Things that you do not see every day! [SEP] It's almost like	going	to Carowinds or someplace and seeing all these little, special little things, you know. [SEP] But they're all over the place.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
"Forget it!" [SEP] But, no, he um, one time put, he said, "I'm	going	to marinate these salmon steaks." [SEP] Neither one of us had had it in our whole married life.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
"Uh-huh, that would be nice." [SEP] He's	going	to marinate it and cook it later, you know. [SEP] And it ended up--, and oh God!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It was awful! [SEP] "I'm not	going	to do that again!" [SEP] On salmon steak, I know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Well, because it was really interesting stuff. [SEP] It was about the same time when all the space program was getting started off and I was in the first grade when the United States launched the first satellite and I was in the second grade when the first manned space capsule was sent up and because of what was	going	on at the time it was real interesting. [SEP] The book just tied right into it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CheezemBurt.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I think it's important because it's the real link you have to your past and heritage and it's also declining for the same reasons you mentioned. [SEP] People just don't have the time or take the time to keep the traditions	going	they just get too busy or too lazy.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CheezemBurt.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Certainly. [SEP] I have some motorcycle stories	going	back two to three generations actually. [SEP] And now that I know your own son is considering purchasing a motorcycle those stories hopefully can help him make // a wise decision //.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CheezemBurt.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
All right, now what? [SEP] Oh I know what I was	going	to tell you. [SEP] Um, another thing my mother read to us was poetry and she also had books that had songs in it, children's songs and so not only did she teach us the words to all those things, but we sang them too.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
But as they get older, I think children are so involved in other things. [SEP] They're	going	to lessons for this and that, and sports, and they're playing interactive games with their computer and, uh, watching TV, and I think, really, they're not reading on their own, like maybe we did when I was that age because we didn't have all those other things to do. [SEP] So I think maybe, reading for young people, is not as important.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I think it probably does, because they're just not reading as much. [SEP] Um, the good students, the ones who do well academically, they're	going	to do OK anyway, but the ones, um, there are some that would really benefit from continuing their reading, either being read to or reading on their own, for pleasure-- Right.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
OK, well , um,	going	back to you, do you think, uh, are there any other ways you can see that reading and listening to stories, and literacy, um, being exposed to literacy, has um, affected you in your life? [SEP] Hmm, well	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um. [SEP] This is a story that my dad told me when I was small, a long time ago that, there was a girl that, she was very young, she was	going	to go visit her parents. [SEP] And she was like driving on a curve.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CorderoRosalinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And she was like driving on a curve. [SEP] And she was, she was	going	very, too fast, and she crashed and then she, um, she goes there, um, every year she comes out at night and then one time a guy passed through that curve and saw her and he stopped there and picked her up and she told him that if she can, if he can take her home to her parents house.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CorderoRosalinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And uh, we were all spending the night at Craig's house and uh, we decided we wanted to sneak out of the house. [SEP] Well, it was about 1:00 in the morning and uh, Craig was scared we were	going	to wake his parents up or his mom up. [SEP] And uh, you know after a little while we ended up talking him into it and uh, so we all snuck out his window in his bedroom and um, we proceeded to uh, go over to uh,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So we thought we were being sneaky, but uh, found out the whole time we were being watched. [SEP] And uh, so after that, uh, the, uh, old man that we burned his mailbox down, uh, told us that, uh, he was	going	to, he would press charges unless we replaced and fixed his mailbox. [SEP] So uh, that whole day I think we put up two newspaper mailboxes, uh, one complete wood frame and plastic mailbox and that was cemented in the ground.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
, I live out on Moss Lake, it is in Shelby, North Carolina, Cherryville actually, uh , me and a buddy of mine from way back in elementary school, we were best friends back then, uh, I invited him over to my house and we were	going	to go out onto the lake. [SEP] I have a jet ski and he's got one too and, uh, so we, we went out there and started drinking a couple of beers.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And uh, we ended up drinking more then	going	out in the water and, uh, we were out in the water and, uh, we come up and we were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And, uh, at one point in time he actually runs into me on my jet ski and, uh, bends the handle bars and runs up on my legs and I got a big bruise on my legs, but I'm not feeling it then, I'm pretty well gone by this time. [SEP] And, uh, it's getting late in the afternoon and he says he has to get home, and he doesn't live on the lake so we load up his jet ski and, uh, put it on the trailer on the back of my truck and uh, we're	going	to go back to his house to take it back. [SEP] So, uh, we get it back on the trailer and we find out that, uh, we bent the handlebar on it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
We're like, "Yeah, yeah we're fine," you know. [SEP] And uh, they're like, "All right," but they, they didn't have any idea that we were, uh, that we were leaving and we were	going	to take the, uh, jet ski back to his house. [SEP] They thought we were just	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And uh, they're like, "All right," but they, they didn't have any idea that we were, uh, that we were leaving and we were	going	to take the, uh, jet ski back to his house. [SEP] They thought we were just	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And I was in the truck, I didn't know what was wrong. [SEP] And I swerved and uh, luckily enough the truck hit the front fender somehow and I bounced off the telephone pole, and it was still	going	and, uh, I had no, I mean I was just totally in shock.

Um, I don't know how much I'd be into reading to just, you know, like a, a program of just reading to children kind of thing. [SEP] But when I do have children, I'm	going	make sure that either, um, you know, my wife reads to them or that, you know, or make it a point that I read to them `cause I think it's, it's really important. [SEP] And actually, uh, my sister has two young children and, um, she's constantly reading to, to her child and, who's two years old now.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And she just seems like a pretty bright, intelligent kid compared to some other two year olds that I've, that I've encountered. [SEP] Are there any personal stories about your past and history and growing up that you're	going	to tell your children? [SEP] Um, yeah.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, yeah. [SEP] I'm sure that there's	going	be stories that I'll, I'll tell them about. [SEP] Um, to tell you the truth, I'll definitely tell my kids, you know, things about, you know, stories about when I was growing up and maybe some things that, you know, you should or shouldn't do.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, in particular I could, I could think of a few things. [SEP] Um, I know when I was really younger, I'll tell them this story, about never	going	near, uh, a frozen pond because when I was really young, um, the lake by my house had frozen over, actually it was just a pond, but it was a pretty big one, um, and we always use to play ice hockey and what not on it. [SEP] And it started to um, get warmer outside, but there was still a layer of ice on top of it, and a bunch of my friends had gone out on to the, the dock.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I remember general things, I remember one time, we were at the shore, my fam, my grandfather had a house in Stone Harbor and there was a hurricane and I remember, um, you know, we moved all the furniture inside for the hurri, hurricane and we went out and he had an awning over his porch and, you know, and we, we double-tied the awning down. [SEP] During the hurricane we'd go out and check to make sure that uh, uh, you know, all the strings were still tied and the awning wasn't	going	to blow away, but I don't remember, you now, I don't think we'd sit around and telling that story I mean, I occasionally mention that. [SEP] "Do you remember?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichDavid.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It seemed like it. [SEP] This was before, this was when my grandfather and her weren't married so we would go over and read it with me I was not even sure what was	going	on, but um, , but I just remember having to read that and that was it um, with her.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichMegan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I was living, uh, right outside of St. Louis, between Jefferson City and St. Louis, MO. [SEP] Um, my parents had a small house on a very friendly suburban street and, ah, one summer day I remember	going	out to the back of our yard, which seemed really big then. [SEP] Uh, I reached into my parents small garden, it had quite a few tomatoes in it, and I just started lobbing the tomatoes over the fence, and I kept lobbing the tomatoes over the fence, and then my next door neighbor, who was probably about four, my playmate at the time, he rode his Big Wheel down the, down the hill there and came and started throwing the tomatoes with me and we were just having a great time not thinking about anything, laughing having a lot of fun	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He came, he opened the door and I remember looking back and seeing the expression on his face, and I could tell that he was disappointed. [SEP] He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't, I wasn't really sure if what I had done was really, really wrong I just knew that he wasn't very happy about what was	going	on by the way he opened the door and by the way he told me I needed to come into the house, and I, I came over there and I stepped up and I didn't even say, "Bye," to my friend and was probably not into that kind of thing I didn't really notice at that time probably I just went into the house. [SEP] And Dad said he had noticed, he had seen me throwing tomatoes in Mrs. Faulk's yard, so he told me that I was in trouble and I was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't, I wasn't really sure if what I had done was really, really wrong I just knew that he wasn't very happy about what was	going	on by the way he opened the door and by the way he told me I needed to come into the house, and I, I came over there and I stepped up and I didn't even say, "Bye," to my friend and was probably not into that kind of thing I didn't really notice at that time probably I just went into the house.

I remember, yeah I remember that based on later conversations that I ( ) with him about it, but at the time I guess I really wasn't sure what it was about, but I knew that when it all came down to the bottom of it, I knew that what I had done was the wrong thing to do and he told me that I'm	going	to probably have to go down there and help Mrs. Faulk pick up the tomatoes when it's all said and done, and I remember being a little bit nervous about that. [SEP] I didn't really know Mrs. Faulk very well she was about 80 and, ah, she was a nice person I had seen her a few times but I was really nervous about that.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
There was a, ah, a rose garden back there and my sister, it's ironic her middle name is Rose. [SEP] Her name is Christy Rose Farrow, and she was back there with me and we're	going	back and seeing these roses and Christy was smelling the roses and she started to put the petals up her nose, and I remember watching her put the petals up there, and I remember watching her put the petals up her nose, and I wasn't really sure why she was doing it. [SEP] I didn't really ask any questions I just thought it was interesting that she was putting the petals up her nose, and it kind of became fun to kind of cheer her into keep doing it, so I was like keeping	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I think she was most unhappy with me because, you know, ah, ah, Christy was only one or one and a half or two and I was the big brother so from there I guess I remembered mom being upset with me because ah Christy had all those petals up her nose and it took a long time to take them out there was a lot of them up there, but, ah, later on, as I grew older, we moved around a lot when I was a kid I remember the first day I woke up and there was a moving truck. [SEP] One day I woke up and there was a moving truck in my, in my yard and I woke up to this sound of that and I looked out the window and there's this moving truck and there's people moving stuff in and I got up and I said, "Mom they're taking our stuff," and I was, and she was like, "Yes, we're moving today," and I was about four	going	on five at the time and so they're taking our stuff out so anyway we moved and they took all our stuff out and moved and she said, you know, "I told you we're moving. You must have forgot," and I must have because it totally took me by surprise, and we ended up at a new place and I remember this, this new house that we were at and, ah, in a pretty area and it had a much bigger yard than the one.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I can't remember what it was but I suddenly got really nervous that I was about to go to school for the first time and that was probably the most stressful day of my life.

Um, when I was young we used to go on a lot of yearly vacations. [SEP] Every year we'd go from, whether it be MO to IL or IO to IL or KS to IL, the whole time I was growing up because in IL that's where my grandparents lived and every year we'd go up there and spend about a week with them in the summer, and we'd also go down there for Christmas too, but mostly I remember	going	down there every year, um, for the summer and it was, ah, a lot of arguing in the car, and I remember sitting next to my, uh, I had two sisters, so the middle one was always in the middle, for some reason.

Um, um another memory with my family that I have is that we had a lot of weddings, ah, and these weddings were always really big weddings, and I've always been told the reason why they're so big is because basically it's Polish, you know. [SEP] Half of my family's Polish, so Polish, we have big weddings and I remember at my cousin's wedding I was like 12 years old	going	to it and I had a my cousin Tim and he was about 10, and, ah we went to this wedding and it has like 200 people. [SEP] My uncle, he's a great guy.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and the reason it was bottoms up was because, was, they serve champagne to everybody in these weddings that's something I can never figure out and if you're a kid you get champagne, if you're an adult you get champagne. [SEP] Everybody gets champagne and some people don't drink it so what's left the kids drink so we were	going	around drinking all this champagne. [SEP] And before you know it it's time for the kids Hula Hoop contest and they've got a stage of course there they do it's one of those huge areas and ah we get up there and they're playing this tune I can't remember what it was and Tim and I were up there and Tim my 10 year old cousin is really drunk and he fell completely off the stage I remember that being somewhat embarrassing but looking back on it I think it's really pretty funny, um, it was uh it was a really neat experience.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So anyhow, I think I spoke to Ramona again. [SEP] No, it was just that one time in the morning, and she said that she was	going	to come back to the office. [SEP] Well, I wasn't even thinking about that, but I was so frustrated, and, I ended up talking to him again.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He didn't say a time again, so he just got me over there stressing out, and I really don't even know when it's needed. [SEP] But I was like, forget it, I'm	going	to eat lunch I was hungry. [SEP] Usually you feel like you have to work through, like you just have to keep working because he needs it even though it wasn't your fault that he gave it to you at the very last minute, you know, I was like ( ), and then Lana calls me in the kitchen telling me Ramona had gotten here and I didn't even know she was coming for sure.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And then I heard him leave, so I'm still finishing what I had to do. [SEP] And here I am thinking he's	going	come in there and be like, you know, just have it out with me, you know, just tell me off like how could I not have this done. [SEP] Even though I don't see how he could have expected me to have it done.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And I was like, "I'm almost done." [SEP] He was like, "All right, well I'm	going	go out and run some errands, and um, just put it up on my shelf, and um, if I have any review notes I'll give them to you in the morning. And I was like "OK," and that was it!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Is it like that all the time? [SEP] Yep whenever he there, um, which he's not there he's there most of the time but he is gone a lot but whenever he is there, and especially if he gives you something to do it's like you don't even want it because you know it's	going	to be that way and it's like other people hesitate to come through because they don't want to have said something wrong and then you go back to him well like, you know, such and such helped me and it's not like you're ratting anybody out you're just saying you know such and such helped me and that's how I got to this number but it's like people are hesitating basically and it's really frustrating. [SEP] So what is it that they wanted you to do?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
We were doing, um , we were doing today it was, um projections it was financial statement like balance sheet and income statement projections for a company that, um, this guy was looking to buy, well he gave us the information that he had projected numbers for 2002- 2003 and we had to put those numbers into financial statements, basically saying they are	going	to have this much, um, this many assets and liabilities at the end of 2002	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
This is Fannie Flono, and she grew up in Ag-- Augusta, GA, and she is	going	to talk about some stories from her childhood.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And you know, they were a close family and they loved each other and all that kind of stuff, but it was just down the road, you know, so they said fine, and, and you, you know, he came back on Sundays and he was with the family at church and all that sort of thing. [SEP] Um, but, ah, one day he didn't show up, on Sunday, uh, for church and so they wondered what was	going	on and they went to this house, ah, down the road and the cousins had packed up and left. [SEP] They had just gone.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He didn't know how to get in touch with them, and he said, you know, you know, as he grew up, you know, he kept thinking about them, and he said he wanted to come back home but he didn't have any way, he didn't have any money. [SEP] And he said finally he know, you know, once he got grown and started working, he saved up his money and he said he was determined to come back and find them, and he didn't even know if they were	going	to be in the same place\\. [SEP] Wow.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Wow. [SEP] But he said he was	going	to find them, and he came all the way back. [SEP] Do you have an idea what year that would be?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Her sister could pass for white, and in fact did pass for white. [SEP] And Granny used to tell the story about how her sister and her sister's husband decided that they were	going	to move to the city, to Augusta, and pass for white. [SEP] And they moved downtown--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And they found this house or this apartment building or whatever it was that they could live in, and it was right on the edge of Broad Street. [SEP] And, uh, they kind of actually stopped visiting the family because they were just, just determined that they were	going	to be white. [SEP] They just didn't like what it was like being black in those days, and that was, you know, I guess, that, that was probably, you know, in the early 1930s, uh, when they did that.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Than the ones who were lighter. [SEP] And actually when we, we kind of began to understand what was	going	on because my cousins were a little lighter, well they were somewhat lighter than we were, and she would not treat them well and we couldn't figure it out, what, what was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
, he was a minister's son, so he had, they had property, and stuff, and they were very well-connected in the community and very, held in high esteem. [SEP] His father was like, uh, the guy who had been pastor of this big church for a long period of time and, and, and so I think her family, the Tates, really wanted to connect with the Keenes for that reason, and so they just really just told her she was	going	to be marrying him. [SEP] And, she didn't really understand.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
This is Chief Master Sergeant Clem Francis, retired from the US Air Force. [SEP] Today he is	going	to talk to us about the Third SS, the U2 Quick and the Blackbird. [SEP] Go ahead Mr. Francis.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
The rest of us after, uh, after we got the trigger out, why we, uh, would bale out of the aircraft, regardless whether if it was water, over land, air or what, but the bottom did go in. [SEP] I want to say that there wasn't any danger of	going	in with the bomb because it would not explode, regardless of how hard it hit the ground. [SEP] Even if the aircraft was on fire, why it, it would uh, burn and it would melt through a lead component for the radiation to leak out.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It's a little screw which set an injection but the, the breathing pressure tube to the pilot and counter pressure. [SEP] Each pilot has a different breathing capacity and we would have to, uh, uh, bend then individual over in the pressure suit uh, uh, I'd have to have to set it for, uh, a second, or which was	going	through school. [SEP] Then he'd dress me, and, uh, he'd set the injection on me and you, uh, uh, we'd have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then we'd come up breathing as hard as we could, and you better if uh, the, the, the top portion of your helmet surged, which you had rubber around the neck and the visor closed.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Then he'd dress me, and, uh, he'd set the injection on me and you, uh, uh, we'd have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then we'd come up breathing as hard as we could, and you better if uh, the, the, the top portion of your helmet surged, which you had rubber around the neck and the visor closed. [SEP] And, uh, if it surged and just kept surging it would go 'whish,' and, like it was	going	to pull your head off. [SEP] You'd better get the little screw turned down a little bit because you could damage and individual's lungs very easily.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And, uh, but, uh, I would think, at night I couldn't sleep. [SEP] I would think, "Well, I'm, I'm	going	to let somebody else go," but then I would think, "My God! [SEP] They've, they chosen me over about 15 individuals there, to go to through that school and I'm not, I'm not.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
This was the first time that, that had happened in 75 years, that TX legislature had voted a military unit being TX Ambassadors, so, needed TX Ambassadors. [SEP] Late 1962, uh, I got orders to go to Washington, D.C. I didn't know what I was	going	for or anything, so was to report to a designated place in Washington. [SEP] Uh, I went ahead up and it was highly classified, even my orders were classified.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I, I just didn't I was just puzzled. [SEP] Of course I came back, after a week, to Laughlin Air Force base, and then shortly thereafter I got orders I could bring my family and everything to Las Vegas, NV and I couldn't tell my wife or anything about why I was	going	there because I didn't know. [SEP] And so, we moved to Las Vegas, NV, and I reported, just like I did in Washington, to a certain address in downtown Las Vegas.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
They told me that, uh, that I would be called in a guy at the end for me to meet. [SEP] It was another GI and said I would go with him on Monday morning to a certain location, and we never was for many, many years, we could not even mention the location, but now I have the declassification of it, Roadrunner's International right there in it's authorized, and it tells all about the A-12 Blackbird crew that I was	going	to in early 1963 and I guess it was the most classified thing that there was at that time in the United States but when I got out and gone out found out what was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Where, I didn't know what the code was, but, of course, I'd take it and turn it in to individuals back at life support but I know that I have measured them and they told me he had 300 degrees on the top of his head. [SEP] But you have to remember, he had a tremendous cooling system	going	in to his full pressure suit and	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
All of our pilots flew on radio silence, period. [SEP] And, of course, they were	going	so fast they couldn't move up and down but evidently they got, uh, word back real quickly by mashing the scrambler, a button on the inside of the aircraft. [SEP] I don't know that; I never was told that, but CIA got the word quick like that, but they never could shoot him down anyway, and they have never, never.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Well, Alex, the youngest, of course he's just so sick of being in this truck, he says, "Get me out of here," you know, just, "Let me out!" [SEP] I say, "OK, everybody, we're	going	to get out of the truck, we're	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
we, you know, they're just saying, "Well what are we doing? We're just	going	to get in the truck and then go back? Let's just at least look at the lake."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
You guys can go, go down to the lake, just be careful. [SEP] " And, uh, so they kind of walked over to the hill, kind of started walking down, and at a point they just had to sit on their butts and kind of slide down, and the trees were all cut, so they'd grab trees as they were	going	down. [SEP] And, um, I was just watching them, and I was up at the top, and then, I started down, I'd figured, let them go first, then I'd, I'd go kind of behind them.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I mean, the hill's, no human being could catch that kind of momentum without gravity pulling him down, and he starts running, and he's running, and you could just see, it was like, there's no way he's	going	to recover from this.

You were passed out half the time. [SEP] Right, they had to go through wondering for three days whether or not I was	going	to live.

And I never worked in a nursing home again after that. [SEP] I kept telling that I was	going	to come back. [SEP] They didn't want the Outbreak monkey to come back.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GavinJeff.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

Yeah you know she fought it the whole time. [SEP] She never thought she was	going	to die. [SEP] OK good, good.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GavinJeff.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
She never gave up and, you know, she went through all the treatments, and then, well, then a funny thing relates to that story like, well then the whole story is not funny. [SEP] But we had, the two or three weeks before, we wound up,	going	to the hospital a lot, we knew her time was short. [SEP] And then, every time I wound up driving into Manhattan, you know, we lived on Staten Island, so I was driving into Manhattan, and every time I would park on the street, I would get a parking ticket.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GavinJeff.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I was dating a guy that lived in the apartment beside Steve. [SEP] And Steve would see me	going	up there to visit him or see us	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And then, um, a neighbor that lived across the street from me, her husband was a member of the Jump Club; Steve was "jumping" then, and she had a cookout one night, invited some people over, and I went over there and, um, I think I was the youngest one there. [SEP] They were all	going	out to a club or something and I wasn't old enough to get in, but I went with the rest of them. [SEP] I think I was kind of at the end of the line and I snuck in anyway and Steve thought I was really cute.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And all my aunts and uncles and cousins came up to help move in and work on the house.

He talks about being in the Depression and they were very poor, and they had to get coal. [SEP] They had to uh, heat their house and there was a place where the trains had to slow down on this hill as they climbed with, with coal	going	to New York City and the kids would get on this train with big sacks, big heavy sacks called burlap sacks and they would steal coal from the train, put it in these big bags, throw the bags off jump off before the train got rolling fast again to go down the hill. [SEP] And that's how they kept warm in the winter, and the winters were very severe.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoedekeThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And I would walk along the road to school and convoys of young men would, uh, ride by in the backs of trucks and I would wave at them and it was not a sexual thing in those days. [SEP] It was just a friendly thing that these were young men that were	going	off to war all of them, most of them, well all of them enlisted men or draftees. [SEP] I can remember one time specifically that, um, my dad, we had two, had a three bedroom home with one bath.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I wish I'd kept them. [SEP] Another experience that I remember very clearly was riding on the train from, we were	going	down to see my grandparents at Bradenton, Palmetto, FL actually below Tampa.

And there's one last little thing. [SEP] Sunday morning we're picking up all our grandkids and we're all	going	out at 4:30 a.m. to watch the meteor shower.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

So he raced back to the house to get my mom and get the car. [SEP] Well, they came and got me and took me back to the house, and my mom, I, I was shaking and stuff, my mom was afraid I was	going	in shock, so she put a blanket around me, and she was like, "Kevin are you OK?" and I was like, "Yeah I'm OK Mom.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
She was like, she was like, "OK you got to go to the hospital." [SEP] So I started	going	nuts .	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Just flipped his bike. [SEP] So they took me to the hospital room, and I'm	going	nuts people are having to hold me down while they pull as, asphalt out of my chin-- Oh gross.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Did they put you to sleep? [SEP] Nah, well like that night they told me they'd let me go home and stuff from the hospital, and my, I mean my, before I went to bed my dad was like, "Well you got to go see a specialist tomorrow," and I was like "Wh, what's he	going	to do?" and he was like, "Well he'll just tell you you're	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

Yeah I did too, actually. [SEP] Well Doctor Trevez was like, "Well, we are	going	to have to wire your mouth shut," and I had never heard of this. [SEP] This freaked me out	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And what scared me the most was when he said before he put the I.V. in my arm, before he did, say before he did surgery, before he was	going	to do the surgery, he said, "OK uh, let's have a word of prayer." [SEP] Yeah I was like OK, please.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I was like, "Wooh." [SEP] You thought you were	going	under. [SEP] So I, so I did, I never heard him finish the prayer though.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
In fact, I, um, when I got to high school, which was in VA, I, um, I remember beginning in the biography section and just starting with "A".

Um, my husband and I both tend to be very critical when it comes to story lines and stuff like that. [SEP] And while we're watching something, I'll say, "OK honey, what's	going	to happen next?"

I really don't want to, um, watch that show any more! [SEP] So it basically, uh, turns you from the, um, plot instead of	going	with the plot. [SEP] It just turns you away from it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And my family is chomping-at-the-bit ready for me! [SEP] "When are you	going	to publish?" [SEP] And when it's ready, it'll be ready, and I really can't rush that.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I wasn't so much even, I, I did not even know how to, I wish I could put my hands on it. [SEP] If I had of thought about it, I had no clue that we were even	going	to talk about him. [SEP] I think, where in the world do I have that?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
For the most part I think it's pretty clean and that's something else I really appreciate, is, when I don't have to do deal with a lot of profanity or unwholesomeness. [SEP] You know, there is so much that you can write about that's good and wholesome and intriguing without	going	into the areas that are unprofitable that, um, and I don't, I haven't read The Foundation again in, like, probably the last five years, but, um, periodically I'll feel like, "I've got to visit this book again!" [SEP] So, you don't mind re-reading?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
But, um, it's, um, and I'm trying to think the theater uh, other than Fiddler on the Roof, of course I haven't seen a lot of different things, but, um, has not had the same level of impact, I guess. [SEP] Uh, uh,	going	to see The Fiddler on the Roof, of course, as a violinist, that, you know, was part of our, our class, um, project, and that was part of our appreciation. [SEP] They also had a full orchestra.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
"That's not how it should have ended!" [SEP] Not that everything has to have a happy ending, it just has to have a, a Bible solution of, one of the things	going	back to The Foundation Trilogy, in their closing chap, chapters, well, it's like two chapters that end the book. [SEP] The chapter before the last chapter is, is titled, "The Answer That Satisfies".	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I appreciate not having to deal with vulgarity. [SEP] I mean, you can, you can be realistic without	going	into great detail. [SEP] I think about the ugliness of life.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So I'm familiar with that particular book. [SEP] Um, in your high school years, you're	going	back to that time period and your librarian was one that you said who encouraged you and you had some challenges between each other in writing poetry-- Um-hum.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And so, um, I found it kind of like being the librarian helper because I was there all the time. [SEP] And, uh, I, as a matter of fact at one point I was	going	to go into Library Science. [SEP] I was just about to ask you!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um-hum. [SEP] And I'm, I'm now with Ron's collection and mine, I'm starting to go into his area and pulling off the shelves, books that he's collected and	going	to read those. [SEP] Ooh!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
But, I think, about the time I started first grade he stopped traveling, and my little grandmother Tina, who ruled everyone with an iron hand, had been living in what we called "the big house." [SEP] I'm, I'm	going	on too much.

That Anne and I split up when she died. [SEP] She didn't specify who would get what, and when she died and the time came to settle up stuff, Mom said, "Ok, how are you and Anne	going	to do this?" [SEP] And so we said, "We'll flip a coin and see who goes first."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Because I know my Granny grew up in Cabarrus County on a farm and was one of three or four kids, and she inherited her father's mother for a season out of every year. [SEP] Poor old woman would come all wrapped up in layers of clothes, and my mother told me this not long before she died, but she said when she was little she remembered her granny showing up and her mother saying, "The first thing I'm	going	to do is unwrap this cocoon." [SEP] She wouldn't have changed her clothes since the last time Granny had seen her probably--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
they all had stories of their own. [SEP] I don't, now, let's see which one was it, I'll tell you this one last story because it's a great story	going	back to the Civil War.

They presumed dead, the war ended, he never came back, they never learned what happened to him, and so she took up with this, I guess he was a traveling salesman, with a wagon and a mule. [SEP] And she put her two children, Maryann and her little brother, Maryann was about 12 and her brother was about eight at this point, and they took, they moved down, or were	going	to move down to Georgia. [SEP] But he, what happened?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And she took in laundry and raised her family as best she could. [SEP] My grandmother Tina was like the youngest of these kids and she was, I guess, eight or nine when this happened, but they, everybody, I mean the Indians were part of the community, although they kind of kept to themselves, but they knew what was	going	on and they would have dealings with the settlers. [SEP] Well, my grandmother Tina, who was a little girl, got sick with some fever, and her mother was staying up with her night and day and was just exhausted.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

This is Candace Walton. [SEP] I'm interviewing Debra Hicks on November 24, 1999, and she is	going	to tell us a story that she remembers from her childhood. [SEP] The story I'm about to tell is about this little girl.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HicksDebra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, she had very big dreams of wanting to become a lawyer one day. [SEP] Um, she, was, at the time, there was a lot of racial tension that was	going	on, so she felt like she wouldn't be able to make it. [SEP] She was kind of confused of what background she wanted to u-, what ethnic background she wanted to use, so she decided to use her black heritage, um background.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HicksDebra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And so she moved to New York and she went to school there, she made it through school and she did become a attorney. [SEP] She later was	going	through problems because they found out that she was a black ethnic and not white, so they would, she could no longer work with the firm.

Okay, this is Paul Martini. [SEP] Ah, it's ah April 14th at about six o'clock on Friday and we're here with Sam Hodges and he's	going	to tell us a story he heard ah when you were a child, is that right? [SEP] Yeah, basically when I was a child.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HodgesSamuel.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Now picture this. [SEP] There's about six or seven of us, little kids, eight-years old, this is a man that's	going	to be giving a good story. [SEP] Right.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HodgesSamuel.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He's got his arm and uh he's trying to put it on his body and it didn't fit and it's too short and it didn't look like his arm so he throws it aside and goes on. [SEP] Um, this happens all throughout history and he was telling us how it keeps	going	on and on. [SEP] And you know as an adult it's not, it's, you know, he, it's a good story but as an eight-year-old kid you're worried about your arm.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HodgesSamuel.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, some remembrances of growing up in the Charlotte area. [SEP] Um, I'm	going	to share a few little stories I remember, uh, happened at Christmas time. [SEP] I remember my dad telling a funny story about my brother, my oldest brother, and they had purchased this huge like little general store type thing that had all these, um, boxes and cartons and stuff that you would put together, and, um, it was actually like a little store-front thing.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
or something. [SEP] And, um, so, of course, a three-year-old is not	going	to stay right anywhere and I just kind of, you know, wandered down the aisle looking at something else or I may have turned the corner, I don't remember. [SEP] And, of course, you know, after whatever it was lost interest for me I looked up.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
before I would go anywhere with my dad again ever. [SEP] I mean I was just convinced he was	going	to lose me and every time he would ask me to go somewhere I would be like, "No you're	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Testing, one, two, three, four. [SEP] I'm here with Sean Jamieson he's	going	to be the third subject and I'm just making sure this recorder's working good.

And only a minority, I guess, are Southerners and uh my friends here are, tend to be people from other places as well and rather than, rather than, ah, Southerners or Charlotteans, so I don't, ah, I'm not although when I'm in the store and when I'm out and about in other places yeah I hear the Southern accent but I don't I think my speech patterns are probably pretty much set at this point and, and I don't think I'm picking anything up. [SEP] OK, so and we're talking, we're talking about, um, I guess	going	back to Chicago and um your, you want to talk about your family [SEP] //um on your dad's side. //	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Every year, yeah we do a reunion every year. [SEP] And it was, was my, my aunt who owned my Aunt Pat who had the, ah, my grandparents' old house, who was instrumental in getting these started and keeping them	going	because she realized she told me this just within the last couple of years that she thought it was very important to have the reunions every year so the family would stay in touch with each other cause otherwise I would never have known my cousins because the only things we might have gotten together for would be maybe at weddings and funerals which are not good opportunities to do much mixing and mingling because there are other things on the agenda. [SEP] At a wedding or a funeral it's really hard to catch up with people.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So my aunt had been, had been real smart about, about scheduling those every year and trying to get as many people there as possible so that we all, ah, kept in touch and we all know who our cousins and our relatives were. [SEP] So who's	going	to, ah, start doing that, who's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So who's	going	to, ah, start doing that, who's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Ah, one of my cousins apparently is, well, two of my cousins are, are keeping it	going	in fact. [SEP] I just had a phone message tonight from my dad saying that the date has been set for this August on the reunion and, ah, it's not clear who's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I just had a phone message tonight from my dad saying that the date has been set for this August on the reunion and, ah, it's not clear who's	going	to host it but, ah, there's still quite a large group of family members in this city of Guelph and somebody is	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Ah, the reason that, one of the reasons my Aunt Pat was always good at being the hostess for it is that the family had, there are two small houses on four big lots on this dead-end street, so there was a lot of room for everybody to kind of spread out, put up a couple of tents or shelters or whatever, have barbecue grills out there, and, uh, a couple of houses to run in and use the bathroom, whatever, so there's just a lot of room and, uh, but it's not clear if that house is	going	to be sold or not now that my aunt has, ah, passed away. [SEP] Apparently in her will she said that the house should be sold and the money given to a, ah, couple of my aunts and it's not clear if a family member is	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Uh-huh. [SEP] And then, ah, I guess the family reunion is, when is the next one you're	going	to go to? [SEP] It's August 12th of this year, August 12th of 2000, and, uh, don't know, don't know too many more details about it and don't know if I'll be able to go.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It sounds simple breaking your hip but you just, it is, I, I'm sure, you know, older people who've had that happen to them, you get into the hospital and you end up catching an infection or something like that from somebody else and your immune system is kind of weakened and she just, um, um, didn't make it unfortunately. [SEP] It sounds like a big loss for the community just because there was so many people and she organized the family reunions but you know at least you know you've got somebody that's	going	to take over and start putting that back together there. [SEP] Yeah but Aunt Pat was definitely the matriarch of the family.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
The bumper cars were a blast. [SEP] We kept stalling and bumping and	going	around in circles, and we just had a wonderful time on the bumper cars .	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
The kids had a blast. [SEP] Everybody was	going	crazy. [SEP] It was a fun Fourth of July.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It was a fun Fourth of July. [SEP] I was afraid I was	going	to step on a hot firecracker because they were all over the place. [SEP] People weren't even looking where they were shooting them off.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So, we went back to the room and we all fell asleep. [SEP] We were	going	to have to leave the next day, so the next day we decided to play on the beach until late in the afternoon and late in the afternoon we decided that we had better get on the road.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And, and we, we're still headed outbound, we cross over, um, we cross over Idlewild and, um, no actually, no this is right prior to Idlewild and he's running 60 miles an hour.

So I try to get in, get on the, the radio with Charlotte. [SEP] And as I'm	going	down the road 65 miles an hour I see the Charlotte police officer on the right hand side sitting in front of, uh, um, that shopping area right, right prior to Conference. [SEP] Is that where the Harris-Teeter's at?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I don't feel comfortable anymore. [SEP] I'm	going	to go ahead and 22 the chase. [SEP] " 10-22 is `Disregard the Chase,' you know, go ahead and, and let back.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
We get to the Petro, we get to the Petro, now the BP station at Idlewild and 51, he makes a right heading towards Union County. [SEP] And, uh, so we start heading down that way and, uh, we're	going	on down Idlewild Rd, keep right on	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Not really, but, uh, they're better at chases; they've had training in chases. [SEP] And, um, so we start	going	over some hills down Idlewild Rd and Brian Rich loses me. [SEP] Um, or I should say, both of us lost him.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Her name was Crystal. [SEP] And so, um, we met in FL, and in Boca Raton and we stayed with my grandparents, and we would stay with my grandparents for at least one night, uh Boca Raton, and then the rest of the week we spent in Fort Lauderdale because my grandfather owned a hotel called The Sanddollar in a place called Lauderdale by the Sea, um, in Fort Lauderdale, and it was fantastic time and when we had the chance to spend time together and just go out on the beach and at night we would go out to dinner I remember	going	to a Benihana Japanese steakhouse, and we just felt like we had freedom, and then we weren't yet 21 so we weren't allowed to go to clubs in Fort Lauderdale, so we basically spent our time, uh, watching movies in the hotel room or just walking along the strip and I remember	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
The meager looking pieces. [SEP] So my mother use to sit back in her chair in the den and talk about how one Saturday Granny, uh, had decided she was	going	to go to town and you know back then, you're talking, oh probably 1930s, early 1930s, uh, my mother would've been 10 or 12, somewhere around there, and Granny, uh, went to the train track to get on the little trolley train, whatever they had at that time to come downtown. [SEP] Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LeakJeffrey.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Now bear in mind that I told you Granny moved in with us, um, towards the later years of her life, and when she moved in with us I was in the 10th grade, so I was just starting high school. [SEP] Um, you know,	going	through puberty and dating and playing basketball and stuff like that.

And it's Sunday morning, we're on our way to church. [SEP] I'm like, "Well," I'm speechless, what am I	going	to say, they already convicted me now, my mother and my sister.

[SEP] Um, I guess I miss	going	to church together because you know we were always in the same youth group.

Well, we played tennis the next week. [SEP] The first time we played was Thursday, then we played again the next Monday, and low and behold there he was again, although he wasn't on the court right next to me, but I noticed him, and I noticed he kept looking over at our court, but I wasn't	going	to make eye contact because that was flirtatious and I was way too shy to be flirtatious. [SEP] So we finished playing and I watched him walk behind our court and onto the common area and speak to someone.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

[SEP] So here I stand at the tennis court with this man, looking oh-so-cute dressed all in white with a little white vest, who I've never met, and we're talking like two little magpies, and I said, "We have a problem."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Ha, ha, but I know he'll say the same thing. [SEP] Anyway we decided we weren't	going	to lose the match, so we settled down and we played and won and had a good time, and I thought, "Well cool. [SEP] I bet we go out to eat now.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

Miami, Florida was almost too much for six people in a car to be together for a 10-day period.

[SEP] So there comes the little man.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It's almost to break, and my manager said, `do not do it, do not do it, do not do it,' so I put your tires back on and I am not	going	to rotate your tires. [SEP] I am very frustrated with this lug. [SEP] "	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He's got the lug. [SEP] Yeah so he goes, "I'm	going	to break it, if I try to put back in I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And I said, "OK." [SEP] He said, "I'm	going	to try. I'm just telling you, you tell your father that I did not break this it was already broken."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Ten minutes later, I mean I was there for like an hour or so. [SEP] He said, oh I said, "How long is it	going	to take, because I wanted to get my book out of the car if I need to take to read." "Oh no, not long at all.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So I put it in my pocketbook. [SEP] I'm like, so I'm just	going	to drive without a lug in my tire. [SEP] He's like, "You have five other ones, you'll be fine.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I pull this out I said, "So when I called the other day," I said, "they told me 25.99, if you want the free tire rotation, 18.99, if you don't, you just get the oil change." [SEP] I said, "First of all," I said, "I wasn't	going	to get a free oil, free tire rotation to begin with, so I shouldn't have been charged, and not even 25.99, 27.99." [SEP] I said, "I shouldn't have even been charged that to begin with."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I said, "Then, he didn't get my lug nut back on," I said, "so I didn't get the tire rotation and I have a broken lug nut." [SEP] I said, "And then, you're still	going	to charge me 26.99?" [SEP] I said, "No way."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I said, "No way." [SEP] I said, "What is	going	on here, I don't you know. I'm not happy with what's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I said, "What is	going	on here, I don't you know. I'm not happy with what's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

"What do we need the money for? How is it	going	to be spent?" [SEP] She genuinely--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
She was a voter. [SEP] Although she was 92 or 93 at the time, she was	going	to get in her car and go vote one way or the other. [SEP] And so, I would try to explain to her how it was very important, with all the growth we were experiencing in Cabarrus County, to keep the, uh, the number of kids in the classrooms to less than 30 if we could, and we weren't meeting that with the growth.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Matthew Purdie. [SEP] I've been asked to recount the story of how I first came to be	going	out with my present girlfriend, who, more than likely, I will end up marrying in year and a half or so. [SEP] Well the story goes something like this: Late November, early December, don't remember which, 1990, 1990 I had a dream.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And, we discussed it, and he said, "Wow!" [SEP] And I said, "Jeffrey, I'm probably	going	to marry this girl." [SEP] And, well, that was like nine years ago.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And we had a very, very, we went to the prom together. [SEP] Then, sometime in June or July, after we graduated, we had a really long talk about what we were	going	to do because we were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Then, sometime in June or July, after we graduated, we had a really long talk about what we were	going	to do because we were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Well, low and behold, that never happened for either one of us. [SEP] And we made it, all through six years of college, together, discussing quite often whether or not we were	going	to end up marrying each other. [SEP] And while, she ended up taking a job in Atlanta, which was a little bit further from Charlotte than Winston-Salem was, and she wanted me to move down there.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
She thought that. [SEP] But anyway, she, is probably	going	to move back here and we will probably get married, and have kids, and live the happily ever after Cinderella little story because I am Prince Charming and she is, the Princess. [SEP] What other story shall I tell?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, and you look at other kinds of things and I think Charlotte, and maybe it's typical of the South, but I think that, uh, maybe there hasn't been as much growth here before and when you have growth and you have people coming in, who, looking for services. [SEP] And you, and you also have a, a government, um, who are, are really ready to take that challenge as opposed to just deciding that, "Hey, listen we're gonna do things the way we've done it for the last, you know, 100 years, whether new people come or need services or ask for amenities or not, we're	going	to keep things the way they are." [SEP] In fact, the town of Matthews, I think, um, at least my understanding is, is that when Providence Plantation, uh, reached a certain point in population they, they wanted to be annexed to the town of Matthews because they thought maybe that the city of Charlotte would annex them and so they wanted to, that they petitioned the town of Matthews to annex.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
My father lives in Queens, NY, off of Throgs Neck Bridge in Bayside, and my mother lives in the Poconos, which is known as Stroudsburg, PA. [SEP] I've been down here now, I would say, oh about seven, seven years now,	going	on eight years. [SEP] I came down here originally on a, to play baseball in the Charlotte area at, uh, one of the colleges here in Charlotte.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Well, at least for a while I was. [SEP] I'm presently	going	to be	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
She's a religious background, religious background upbringing, which I cannot say I've been a part of. [SEP] And, um, she's	going	to calm me down a lot I think and, uh, instill a lot of, instill a lot of positive aspects of my life that have thus far been deferred. [SEP] How did you meet her?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It's getting brighter and brighter, it seems, every day. [SEP] And, um, it's	going	to be a new adventure for us	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So, uh, yeah. [SEP] I'll definitely want them to pursue baseball, but, by all means, it's probably	going	to be whatever they want to do. [SEP] I don't want to force them or anything so--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So, it seemed like a really good place to come to, and so far I really like it. [SEP] Um, I'm	going	to tell you a story about a trip I took with my sisters. [SEP] Um, I have four sisters and we're all about a year and a half apart and we're	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, I'm	going	to tell you a story about a trip I took with my sisters. [SEP] Um, I have four sisters and we're all about a year and a half apart and we're	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
this guy was crazy, this cop, he said that we were in a really bad section of where people were like murdered and killed and like thrown like behind like the rest stop. [SEP] So my sisters are sitting on the curb thinking, "Oh, my God, we're	going	to die, right?" [SEP] And not to mention it's getting later in the day and it was about, I think it was late March, early April, it had to be.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And not to mention it's getting later in the day and it was about, I think it was late March, early April, it had to be. [SEP] But anyways, so the sun had started descending,	going	down. [SEP] Anyways, this guy comes and he fix, he must have left about four times, I don't know where he was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Anyways, we got in the car and it got us to Savannah, GA. [SEP] And we arrived in Savannah, um, it was Mardi Gras, was it Mar, no it was St. Patrick's Day and let me tell you there were some crazy things	going	on. [SEP] The woman, the desk attendant, the hotel we checked in well, first we couldn't find any hotels, because it was booked, apparently Savannah is like really crazy around St. Patrick's Day.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, and then we went to, let's see For, I want to say it's Fort Myers Beach I think, the beach is on the West Coast, we went down, it's about an hour from my grandma's and uh, it's a really nice beach, it's uh, was pretty warm that day. [SEP] I think, we all got some color, but they were having an epidemic of red tide and so all the fish were washing up on the shore and um, luck be it, since we were having such a good time um, Allison, Nancy, and I decide we are	going	to take a walk along the beach and there were fish strewn everywhere so we were careful not to step on them. [SEP] However, Allison wasn't paying attention and she stepped on a fish and it got a barb, which is one of it's defense mechanisms, stuck in her foot, so it was really painful and her foot swelled up and everything.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
What's his favorite? [SEP] Um, he doesn't really have a favorite; he picks whichever one is	going	that night. [SEP] He just got a book it's called, um, Eagle Boy, and it's about a, um, a Indian tribe on the CA coast, who does, uh, they run out of food in the area where they are.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Just anything to get out of doing my job. [SEP] So after she noticed that I was	going	to be just a little stubborn and not follow, do what she tell told me to do, she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family. [SEP] So she began to tell this story.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I don't feel good. [SEP] " The little girl disappointed her mother so badly, but her mother said, "How in the world am I ever	going	to get her to wash these dishes?" [SEP] So she said, [SEP] "Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

It's always been my dream that my children all go to school. [SEP] But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're	going	to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money. [SEP] " At that time my dad was in prison at the time, so it made it really hard for my mom.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Yes, my brother went to school. [SEP] He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and	going	to school too. [SEP] So he graduated from, um, Johnson C. Smith, here in Charlotte.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I think that was the last class I took. [SEP] My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was	going	to school. [SEP] But you would have been able to be a, a teacher if you had continued?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband. [SEP] After all of this was, after I, I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of	going	back to school. [SEP] I just got to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never went back.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
My name is Bonnie Rindner and I was born in San Antonio, TX, and the story I'm	going	to tell is about my mother. [SEP] Um, a little background first.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RindnerBonnie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
She is Japanese-American. [SEP] She has lived in the Charlotte area for 13 years, and she is	going	to talk about growing up Japanese-American in West Virginia. [SEP] Um, when I grew up in West Virginia, um, it was like it was backwards compared to the Charlotte area.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And, uh, she looked up and could see the bombs and everything. [SEP] And she remembers being scared and thinking that she was	going	to die, and she said it was just one of the hardest times of her life. [SEP] That, but, uh, they made it through that, and um, she really never showed any bitterness or anything towards American people, but, uh, she was always just grateful for her life.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
How did your parents meet? [SEP] They met, my, my mother was	going	to Tokyo University in Tokyo and working part-time at a china factory, and my father had gone there to buy some china for his mother, and, uh, he met my mother and just fell head over heels in love. [SEP] And she thought he was a crazy	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Not, um, right off. [SEP] I know the story he tells about, well he's always telling about	going	to play music and how they'd play when he was young. [SEP] So can you think of a story?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He's always got a story to tell, regardless if he sees you or if it's a family gathering. [SEP] He's got, you know, he's	going	to be the one that's got, the one who is keeping the crowd up, or, or, you know, just being himself. [SEP] What about you?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So I think I'd probably be a little bit of him, yet a little bit of everybody else, and I'm not really one to steal the, steal the show at gatherings or what have you. [SEP] If you were	going	to tell a story to your kids about your childhood, what story would you tell? [SEP] It would probably all be sports related stories, um, because sports to me has been such a big factor in my life whether it teaches you the value of competition or the value of sportsmanship or the learning from mistakes of, um, in sports you are sometimes forced to make quick decisions and sometimes those decisions are not necessarily the right ones.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
The team from the northern part of our county, North Stokes and we were the southern part, South Stokes. [SEP] And, uh, they had one pitcher in particular who didn't like us and he was scheduled to pitch that night and after I had been hit the third time and my best friend had been hit the second time, we kind of decided that we were	going	take it upon ourselves to hit back. [SEP] Only not with baseballs but with fists, so we charged the mound.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, so, you know, things like that are learning experiences where you learn to grow up and mature. [SEP] So what you	going	to tell your kid if someone from away hits them three times with a baseball? [SEP] Charge the mound?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, I was decent I guess. [SEP] So is that	going	to be the sport you push on our kid? [SEP] I'm probably not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So is that	going	to be the sport you push on our kid? [SEP] I'm probably not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I'm probably not	going	to push any sport on our kid, my kid, although I have always said when I was in college and, right after I gave up my sports career, I always said my kid, I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Especially when we first started dating and you didn't necessarily have the most reliable car of the people in NC. [SEP] Your little wrecked `84 Honda Accord wasn't necessarily the thing you were	going	to drive two hours away, especially two hours to come and see me. [SEP] But, um, one of the things I remember was you putting it, putting yourself getting in trouble, and really probably wasn't one of the wisest things we have ever done.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I just remember you coming up and that was one of the best times we have had. [SEP] And of course one of the things I remember most was	going	out to the Farmhouse which was our first official, unofficial date. [SEP] And by our first official, unofficial date, should I go into that, too?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Morgy! [SEP] And, um, so we ended up	going	out but I didn't have any idea that you did have a boyfriend! [SEP] But I told them to tell!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And during the summer when we were home from school, and I was five or six years old when they were both still home. [SEP] She was responsible for making sure the house got clean and the chores got done and to make sure we played a part in that, and of course she was	going	to make sure we did our part. [SEP] So she was the biggest slave driver I've ever seen, and my brother was always the rebel, and I, you know, as a five or six year old, I did what I could and she didn't really have a lot of trouble with me, but with my brother being, when she was 16 he was 12 so you can imagine what kind of battles they had.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, because I ended up making a lot of good friends and, um, really loving the part of town that I moved to and really adapting to, um, my community there, um, and getting involved. [SEP] And actually, the friends that I made there are the ones I ended up	going	to college with and not the ones from my first high school. [SEP] Right.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
They didn't like me at first `cause I was the new girl and where, you know, most of the guys, if a new girl comes in, of course they're	going	to be friendly just because it's new blood or whatever.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And one of them was that one time I wanted something on top of the bed that couldn't reach and so you said, my mom said to get, to find a way to get it, and so I don't remember what I grabbed, but I grabbed something and I climbed on top of the bed and I grabbed the thing that I wanted and I think they were like surprised because they didn't think that I would actually do it. [SEP] Another one was when I think I was younger than that I was trying to climb up on a couch and my grandfather was like watching me behind me and he kept saying to everybody, "she's	going	to fall, she's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaCaroline.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
My mom told me stories. [SEP] She would make up stories for us, my sister and I, at bedtime when we lived in Miami and she would tell us stories like, including like characters that were like us but we had different names and stuff, or we would be animals and they would have morals to them at the end and, or we would read books at night before	going	to bed. [SEP] So this was in your bedroom?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaIvonne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Uh, the books were always available to them. [SEP] I read to them at bedtime uh, in their beds, other times they sat in my lap during the day, um, like	going	over the pictures, the sounds and the tone of voice, uh, through me, um, as to what the character was feeling, scared, happy, angry. [SEP] When I felt like it um, it would be effective and my children's behavior said, "They were really into this story," at that point then I would add my own words and make up more of what had caught their interest.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SmithPatricia.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Um, my very favorite book is God on a Harley. [SEP] Um, it, through that book it was me	going	through all the same experiences as the author and I saw more clearly what I needed to do. [SEP] OK, well thanks Pat.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SmithPatricia.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So, um, there was, at the end of the sports season, the fall sport season and the spring sport season, at South Mecklenburg there was always, a what they called, a banquet and they didn't serve any food, but for some reason they called it a banquet. [SEP] They had all the children, the students from the fall sports up on the stage to be introduced, get whatever recognition were appropriate, and, um, there was	going	to be one in early December of 1995.

So we're talking some more, and I said, "I went and got a Christmas tree." [SEP] He said, "What are you	going	to do this evening?" [SEP] I said, "I'll probably put the Christmas tree up."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So Michaela came home and I said, "Guess what? I'm	going	to McAdenville." [SEP] And she said, "Oh my God!"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
She called Shelle , Shelle was at the house in five minutes! [SEP] "I can't believe it she's	going	out with him again! You're	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

You're	going	out with him again!" [SEP] So we went out again and we went out the next Friday and Saturday and the next Friday and Saturday and the next Friday and Saturday, and meanwhile, all the kids at school are in absolute shock that we liked each other and we were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And one friend of Ryan's, Brandon said to Michaela one day, "Wouldn't it be weird if your mom and Mr. Speckman got married? And like, you moved into that house and you were taking a shower and Ryan, Ryan's your stepbrother and he's	going	to knock on the ba-, how weird would that be?" [SEP] Michaela told me that and I said, "That is so weird."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
OK. [SEP] My name's Carmen Stack and I'm just	going	to tell a little bit about myself. [SEP] Um, I was born in Charlotte, NC and I moved to Monroe, um, which is about forty-five minutes east of Charlotte, um, when I was about three.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
She's in high school. [SEP] Her name is Ivy and she's	going	to turn seventeen in a couple weeks. [SEP] And my grandmother lives next door and my grandfather works across the street from where we live so, we're all really close and pretty tight and, um, I'm real, I'm closer with my grandmother, um, which is my mom's mother, and, um, we do a lot of stuff together, go shopping, and go to lunch, and stuff everyday.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And, um, when I was probably about eight years old my mom and I, um, well we had two dogs, one was a Russian Wolfhound and one was just a little mutt-dog. [SEP] But, um, we left them there by themselves with, uh, well like a bowl of food out, which usually we don't do, but we were	going	to go get some lunch and, um, we were gone for probably about twenty minutes. [SEP] And we came back and, Mongoose was the little one and Tanya was the bigger dog, uh, but when we came back, we saw that Mongoose, uh, was bleeding from her eyes.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
What was your favorite place? [SEP] Well, we would all, well our favorite place, I mean we were pretty young, so our favorite place was like the Pavilion or	going	to walk on the strip or something. [SEP] But, um, we, you know, during the day it was always the beach,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

She just always wants everything to be at her house and kind of be centered around her. [SEP] So after she's gone I don't really know what we're	going	to do. [SEP] It'll be kind of hard for us.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It'll be kind of hard for us. [SEP] But, ah, she's 74 and she's still	going	strong but actually yesterday she had a small stroke but she's, she's OK. [SEP] She's better today.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
She'll tell you like it is and if you don't like it then that's just too bad. [SEP] But we've come to realize that's her and that's just the way it's	going	to have to be. [SEP] But, um, um, so my next story, I guess I want to talk about, uh, I guess I'll move on to kind of high school era.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And, uh, you know, I just kind of, it was Andy's truck and he was driving. [SEP] And, um, we were	going	to Lake Twitty, and I kind of just got volunteered into	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

And then, and then it was always like an adventure though because then all of a sudden, toward the end, like the parents are coming back. [SEP] And we all know that if we don't have everything cleaned up you're	going	to get punished. [SEP] And so it was like, "Can they do it?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Can they get cleaned up in time? [SEP] Are they	going	to make it?" [SEP] So it's like having a blast and	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Are they	going	to make it?" [SEP] So it's like having a blast and	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
-which usually meant that they weren't being careful. [SEP] But anyway their stories would go on and on about	going	one mile an hour up a hill taking forever to get somewhere driving getting up, a head up steam in the winter and Bucking snowdrifts is what they called it. [SEP] The snowdrifts would come out into the streets into the road and, uh, this was in rural MN, so half the time you couldn't see where the road was anyway but they would go plowing these snowdrifts, you know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And, uh, also the story of Paul, and, in particular, it's in, I think, it's in the Book of Romans, Romans 8:28 where he says, "All things work for good for those who love the Lord." [SEP] Uh, and Paul, Paul's life is like a Indiana Jones movie, where, at one time, there's 40, 40 Jews, uh, Jewish scholars or whatever had taken the vow of hunger; until they caught him they weren't	going	to eat. [SEP] So there's 40 guys who hadn't eaten in 30 days chasing them.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So there's 40 guys who hadn't eaten in 30 days chasing them. [SEP] So you reckon at least one of them is	going	to catch them somehow but he, he managed to elude them all. [SEP] And then of course he spent the rest of his life you know on shipwrecks and in jail and being beat up, and, uh, I'm sure verbally abused and just you name it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
The freedom that we had as children is unheard of today. [SEP] There was nowhere in town that you couldn't ride on a bicycle or walk, as long as you told your mother where you were	going	and you were home by dark. [SEP] I wish that my children, growing up in a different age where they didn't have this kind of safety and where everybody in the town didn't look out for them, could have had this experience of this much freedom.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
They went to the same church we went to, First Methodist, and they sat on a certain pew and woe be unto the person who sat, that chose to sit on the Lann twins' pew. [SEP] They watched everybody's coming and	going	when we, we kids on the street became teenagers. [SEP] They could tell you who everyone was dating and, if you were a girl, whether or not you got a goodnight kiss under the porch light and probably reported it at every bridge table they sat at for the next several weeks.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
The first thing one of them asked was, "Kitty's age was not in the newspaper, how old was she?" [SEP] I said, "Kitty didn't tell her age when she was alive and I just don't think we're	going	to start now." [SEP] They were not even put off and did not even slow down.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
They were not even put off and did not even slow down. [SEP] The next thing they wanted to know was I	going	to sell the things in mother's house and how much did I want for the mirror above the fireplace. [SEP] It, I guess it was somewhat reassuring even then, that it didn't matter that they didn't express sympathy, but that some things never change and always stay the same.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
My great grandmother, who was in a big wooden wheelchair, paralyzed with arthritis, would go on this camping trip for the whole summer also. [SEP] Mother and her sister spent their days playing in the woods, wading in the creek, swimming on the scuppernong vines and sometimes picking berries and	going	fishing. [SEP] When the rain came my grandfather would tell Mother not to touch the tent with her finger because then the tent would leak so of course Mother would lay on her cot looking up at the tent close to her and touch it with her finger a slow drip would come and Mother would be in trouble but not as much trouble as when she was playing on the muddy creek bank and lost her shoe the only pair she had.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasKay.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Growing up, almost everybody went to church and students went with them and it sure didn't make them perfect, but it seem to uh, place some fear in their minds, some people today I think have no fear, even fear of death. [SEP] They think they're	going	to come back, it's some temporary vacation and they don't realize when they use violence or they when they overdose how permanent it is. [SEP] So if we don't, people have different tendency of churches and religions, Judaism, Hinduism, ( ), Christianity and then you have Atheist.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It's the home of West Virginia Wesleyan College and that was my playground, that was my own, the place where I spent so much of my childhood playtime and, uh, running through the different buildings and structures of the campus. [SEP] Uh, having a free reign,	going	and coming as I pleased almost, because my grandfather was the Dean of the College. [SEP] And, and everybody knew me so nobody really tried uh, to uh corral me, so I was sort of free to go and do what I wanted, you know when the buildings were open.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Someplace like that, that is more south. [SEP] But, I enjoy WV and I enjoy	going	back and meeting friends and uh, stirring up memories.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
But uh, with my last two interviews, but I digress, anyway. [SEP] ( ) Dad, Dad, um, do you remember	going	to Audra State Park a lot when you were a younger teenager, and if so, what kinds of things would you do there, including snake hunting, drinking of alcohol, etc? [SEP] Jess, I never hunted snakes because I don't like snakes.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
revolutionary proportions, but why do you identify so much with the Jewish plight portrayed in Fiddler on the Roof?

\\ Do you like computers? [SEP] I mean you're	going	to, you are opening a new business-- \\ \\ I am computer illiterate, so I don't have a like or dislike for them because I don't know what they can do for me.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

As a child I loved it, but as I grew up there just really wasn't a whole lot that Buckhannon had to offer other than the fact that, you know, was where my memories of childhood are and my parents. [SEP] And I like	going	home to visit my parents and seeing my friends but as far as wanting to live there, I wouldn't. [SEP] OK, I think y'all have a phone call.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
They left out of NY and went to Scotland. [SEP] And, um, he said you would look out if you were up on deck and the waves, the swells were way up higher than, than the boat itself and looked like you were	going	to drown. [SEP] But the Queen Mary was right beside to them.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I wanted to be a ballerina. [SEP] The ballerina part never came about, but I, I did go on to college and I, um, transferred a lot and ended up	going	to a lot of different colleges which was kind of fun. [SEP] I went to Marshall University, and I went to University of Pittsburgh, and I ended up graduating from West Virginia University with a major in printmaking and a minor in art history and English literature.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Especially the anti-religious art. [SEP] Um-hmm, well art has always been controversial and has always reflected what is	going	on in the world. [SEP] You know, and, um, so, you know, having studied art history, that doesn't, it doesn't shock me or surprise me that much.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And I, you know, I don't like it, personally, because, you know, it does offend me, what, what I have seen, and I don't like the idea that we are giving the money to create extremely offensive art, but, um, again, that, that's, you know, is, art reflects what's	going	on and art is, is very spiritual regardless of whether its content says, you know, something about God or not, there, there has a very spiritual quality about it. [SEP] It's very powerful	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I've always been interested. [SEP] It's a, it was a good way to find out what was	going	on outside the world that I was living in. [SEP] So do you remember any particular ones that you really liked, or anyone?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WerthChristopher.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So maybe, you know, it was just, you know, you know, when I would physically see her for a while, it was like once a year. [SEP] But there was never any storytelling	going	on. [SEP] Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WerthChristopher.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And she started, started pulling me or something, I don't remember exactly, so the dogs circled her and snarled and growled at her and she got, backed back into the house. [SEP] And I wouldn't come in because I knew I was	going	to get a whipping for climbing up in that tree. [SEP] And later, I guess I forgot and she knew I would.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

Yep. [SEP] She's probably	going	to be my best teacher. [SEP] She is?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteJustin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So, she kept trying and got pregnant with me, and carried me to full term and so, since she was, and my dad were both much older, I was a terribly spoiled brat. [SEP] Because I was their only child and they knew I was	going	to be their only child and, within reason, I got just about anything I wanted that they could afford, I got. [SEP] Oh wow!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
But when I was, I think one of my earliest recollections, was when I was three years old, Mama and Daddy and I went down to, to FL. [SEP] And I remember,	going	through the lobby of the hotel where we stayed at with my bathing suit on and with one of those God-awful swim caps that everybody that you see when you look in the 40s movies and it felt like I was in a vacuum when I was walking! [SEP] I could hear my feet in my ears!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
But it still got wet. [SEP] But that's one of the memories I have of walking across the lobby of the hotel and	going	clunk, clunk, clunk as I was walking across and then	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And my mother would say to me, "Frances Jeanette! If you get any darker, they're	going	to make you sit in the back of the bus!" [SEP] Oh my gosh!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So, um, we lived on Fort Bragg Rd, which, at that point, was the only road between Fayetteville and Fort Bragg. [SEP] And with all the added construction and all that, from six in the morning until nine, it was bumper-to-bumper traffic on this little two-lane road	going	to Fort Bragg. [SEP] Wow.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And I remember all the headlights on all the cars were painted black for the first half, the first, the top semi-circle was black so that when if you went out at night, the light would shine just down on the road and not straight ahead. [SEP] Everybody had window shades, you didn't have blinds back then, but everybody had window shades that were blackout shades and you had to pull them down at night before you turned on any of the lights, because everyone was deathly afraid that the Germans or the Japanese were	going	to come bomb us. [SEP] Not that they ever did or--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
\\ \\ --I don't think \\ they ever planned on it, but everyone was quite sure that that was	going	to happen. [SEP] Looking back it almost seems silly.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And she'd put me up on the piano bench and would know for at least 30 or 45 minutes exactly where I was because I was sitting there playing the piano. [SEP] So when I was four, all my little friends were	going	take, ballet and tap dance lessons and I wanted to, but they encouraged me to play take piano lessons because the piano teacher lived right around the corner and the dance teacher was all the way on the other side of town, where her dance studio was.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
She always kept him in the backyard, so I never went in the backyard. [SEP] I'd always go in the front door there instead of	going	around to the back. [SEP] I hadn't thought about that until just now, for a long time.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Oh, I bet. [SEP] And then coming back, we came back through Roanoke, VA and then were on the Skyline Drive, and Daddy said, "We're	going	to go to Roanoke and there's Roanoke Mountain there." [SEP] Or Roan Mountain, anyway, there's supposed to be a mountain right in the middle of Roanoke.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Or Roan Mountain, anyway, there's supposed to be a mountain right in the middle of Roanoke. [SEP] So I was thinking, having looked at all my books, school books, that it was	going	to be like the Rockies.

On the left was a living room with a fireplace. [SEP] On the right was a dining room and there were stairs	going	upstairs between that. [SEP] And behind the dining room was a little, small room that they called a breakfast room, which was just because they had a wall between that and the kitchen.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And, well, each, each of the bedrooms had the separate stove and refrigerator and they shared a bath. [SEP] And we would rent them to couples who were just	going	to be there while their husbands were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It was! [SEP] It was necessary because the guys were	going	off to war and the, their wives didn't know when or if they would ever see them again. [SEP] Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
She came down and stayed usually a couple of months, all summer. [SEP] And she and Leola, Leola brought her over to see Daddy for a condolence call, and sparks flew and they started	going	out and that's when they decided to get married and she became my stepmom. [SEP] Wow.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And I mean it was scandalous! [SEP] So she had a lot of talk	going	on about her when she married Daddy and came down to Fayetteville. [SEP] And, um, cried a lot about it because some people were very spiteful to her.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So yeah, I learned how to drive at a very early age and needless to say my first car was a straight drive and no one, um, in that town really waited until they were 15 or 16 to drive. [SEP] We all were driving pretty early because who's	going	to know about that far out that we didn't have a license so here's related, um, to driving.

I don't want to have anything more to do with the tractor. [SEP] " Well my dad said, "Get back on it your	going	driving.

yeah i can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in DC are like controlling things for the the Midwest and uh it doesn't matter who they put in office they're	going	to fall subject to uh um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2073-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you know maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing you know that's uh with the economy	going	the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2073-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the at the booths they they say that these older voters that uh you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country so they they don't come out turn out to vote and they're the ones that uh you know really know what's	going	on have the experience and have seen you know how politicians can you know screw up or whatever um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2073-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

sure and if you get one of those false negative reportings and and you're fired from your job that's	going	to carryover into other jobs um no matter um you know if it's truth or not so yeah it can stick with you for a long time yeah uh according to uh to the way that that our test is set up apparently everyone is supposed to be tested within a five year period	#telephone#	telephone_sw2096-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right and uh they they do it on a random basis i'm not sure how they can guarantee that everybody is	going	to be tested within five years if it really is random um-hum um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2096-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you know it's just a hangover i guess from uh from that particular generation and uh but yeah they're they're just adamant that they're not	going	to be you know tested and they're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2096-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum oh yeah yeah yeah because you'd be strongly into denial  it's just like well we know you take it we've got the positive test results and you're	going	i don't i don't right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2096-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right and so we we have really enjoyed that and it's really nice not to be running out some of the video rentals can be expensive and yeah well	going	to the movie can be unbelievable and	#telephone#	telephone_sw2101-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and um-hum right	going	and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something so we i have and it's so convenient at home and you can do it anytime you you take the notion yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2101-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
but uh TV is something that we try to not um deliberately try not to get hung up on it like you say yeah we do too it too many other things to do and too much	going	on um-hum and we don't want our kids to to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your spare time	#telephone#	telephone_sw2101-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh and then i like the they have a new one now the Star Trek the Next Generation which it's an all new cast but kind of the same idea	going	out to new places and and doing new things and right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2102-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
when i when i started thinking about this that those are some of my favorite shows McGyver because it's it's only one person there more than uh you know instead of a cast of people but he's always	going	out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and you know pieces of baling wire and uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2102-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
some of the little things yeah and uh i just decided i had to do that i think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it i mean i could just sit mindlessly in front of a TV set for hours and i just realized i was sort of like an alcoholic if i didn't get the booze out of the house i was	going	to drink uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2102-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
huh it kind of kept you guessing on on uh what was	going	to happen next right right you	#telephone#	telephone_sw2102-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right right you how they're	going	get out of their latest scrape yeah i do remember that and uh i remember as a kid my parents watching the Ed Sullivan Show that was really the big deal in our household	#telephone#	telephone_sw2102-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
let's see the more that we do that we do or that we can do to help them become self sufficient is	going	to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming a you know a reality  i know that uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2104-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
somewhat sleep a guy woke me up and uh said you'd better get out of the the tent they're they're liable to come down several of the others had already come down blown down they hadn't blown away but they had flattened and i said okay i didn't you know was kind of groggy didn't know what was	going	on and crawled out of that tent and uh sure enough uh shortly after that they blew down so we're out here in the pitch dark in this wind and it starts to rain naturally	#telephone#	telephone_sw2108-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah a couple of generations of you know being around people and boy there's nothing left of them as far as wildness goes well that's true and and it's sad because now they they're so used to people they're	going	into the towns and raiding garbage cans and stuff and that presents a threat to the people living there and now they're having to shoot them huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2108-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
that's right there goes his battery it doesn't take much but uh we got him all back	going	and packed up and came on back uh let's see i i had another another camp out that wasn't uh near as bad in fact it had some really good good points to it i'm trying to think of exactly where we were	#telephone#	telephone_sw2108-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i wonder how truthful all of that was or whether that was fictional yeah i i i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the FBI uh	going	i guess yeah well they keep it rather secretive yes	#telephone#	telephone_sw2109-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah yeah yeah well because that's the way they they might seem outwardly but boy there's a lots	going	on in there that's right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2109-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
because actually when you when you do uh service overseas you end up learning something usually that's that's really useful plumbing or farming or or something like that so you're really learning a skill yeah and you know all these old people they would get out of this right all the ones that are already retired so what could we could do is take all the retired people that are	going	around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country i'm just teasing	#telephone#	telephone_sw2110-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh okay real pretty like a swamp oh yeah yeah oh okay yeah i been uh i got uh talked to someone else before that was a uh a Texan but i guess that's uh that's what we're	going	to have this is uh a TI experiment to see how talk Texans talk to other people i don't know where are you from	#telephone#	telephone_sw2110-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

and that's real discouraging thinking you're sitting there working to separate it and then they and someone else isn't	going	to take the time to put it in two separate bags right right so they're they're really trying to start keeping an eye out for those you know talking to the people again about	#telephone#	telephone_sw2111-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah and uh i don't think that's	going	to die very quickly he is getting some support there were a lot of people that are uh that were skeptical and the Cowboys are coming back and they have a pretty good team Troy Aikman looks like to be looks like he's got the star qualities for a quarterback hum yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah if they'll just give him some protection and don't kill him before h e yeah well i was surprised at the the way they drafted last year they didn't really didn't go for the uh big offensive lineman or the defensive lineman they're	going	for the skilled positions so quarterbacks they really yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
wins uh in the long run you can have the best half back there is or the best quarterback but if they don't have any blocking maybe they can't do anything yeah they've got an awful lot of good draft picks coming up it's	going	to be interesting to see what they do with them yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah yeah it really does the only way they can get any information is through someone who's so crazy and bizarre it's hard to tell what he's	going	to do next so yeah so it was a good movie uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2141-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah i i'm wondering though they're not	going	to do it that's my biggest problem is even if you give them the death penalty they appeal it and appeal it and appeal it and there's you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah and i do agree that they keep people that we spend too much money keeping people in prison the jails are overcrowded if they're	going	to do well you know let's do it uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah they're not they don't know when they	going	to die they know they got the death penalty but that don't mean nothing not anymore well i i assume that you live in do you live in Texas	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

my mom would probably kill us but but uh you know it's something that has to be done to me if they bring kids into it because now kids are killing and so they	going	to have to do something with the death penalty or to scare these people i think that's the whole thing they're not scared they know they're not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i'll pull the switch i'll even do you know to me if if that person can forgive them fine but what is that man	going	to do next is he	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

so but i know many people who have changed majors several times in uh college uh in fact very few people finish in four years now do you think it do you think it's well worth	going	to uh uh bigger school or more well-known school uh i really don't think it makes that much difference what size of the school college or university one chooses as long as they have a decent program and they're uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah that was a good thing to look out for i looked into	going	to Marquette also and had a chance to get a scholarship there but it would have only covered uh about a quarter of the cost of the first uh year which uh wasn't enough of a motivation to uh to go there to commit to to four years well we're still writing checks for the loans for Notre Dame	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
but i think there's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us and like you said save the commentaries because i'm	going	to listen to the the news and draw my own opinions i don't really need their help to do that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2154-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah if you follow the scriptural principals it's	going	to work out because those are that's the best way to do it you know but the thing is is that then God gets the glory not a president not a king and i think that's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory	#telephone#	telephone_sw2232-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and i know people that have done that i mean i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes and just say i bind you in Jesus name your  i just and rebuke any enemy because i believe it's a spiritual war that's	going	on and it's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home illegally that's not normal	#telephone#	telephone_sw2232-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

in well i think i think my long-term sense of of budget concerns is that we're	going	is a lot of others government's spending goes on goes towards this uh health care and things like that and a lot of causes of poor health or need for health care are	#telephone#	telephone_sw2246-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
somehow we still i guess believed that the countries that we were helping were were eventually	going	to pay us back and that hasn't happened	#telephone#	telephone_sw2246-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so it's a sort of like this is uh  i see a i don't know there's if there's a metaphor	going	on who are we loaning the money to and people can disagree about who that money is being loaned to yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2246-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah yeah in some in some cases it uh i think it's actually	going	to you know the people that it's intended for in other cases uh and and this is all based and this is all up to actually the government that's in control now in some cases the the money actually does filter down to the to where it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2246-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

it's a lot easier then well i know my parents like to camp a lot and they uh they've been	going	to Gulf Shores Alabama oh uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2248-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh you know like if we're just	going	through and they camp one night and then head on right right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2248-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

well that would be a help i wish they would do that here we have got so little landfill space left that we're	going	to run out before the end of this decade and it's really	#telephone#	telephone_sw2249-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

right uh because otherwise uh you know they're not	going	to go house to house collecting it and you're not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2249-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
they should last a while well let us hope that everybody's	going	to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because i believe we are i i do believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening	#telephone#	telephone_sw2249-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i think they will as long as they can but the problem obviously is the cost of health care as you know it's just	going	completely out of sight right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
it is very much so it's a billion dollar problem you know every year uh our company had it doesn't apply to me thank goodness it applies to you know to the younger employees that they're having to pick up you know more of the uh health insurance cost you know themselves the deductibles are	going	up and the co-payments are	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage uh-huh i guess it also depends on how many how many times you're	going	to use it now we	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and if you yeah if you want to so at least you you know you wouldn't have any surprises you can order any type of you know service you want but you stand a good chance you know having to pick up at least part of the bill yourself um-hum so the so i guess that if when i get a job and i and i look into the health insurance that they're	going	to pay for then i should really look really really deep into the policy um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum but i would really check that out because i'm concerned in coming years it's	going	to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger folks what i'm really scared about and you know i'm i don't know firsthand but i it seems to me that like you were saying earlier that the deductibles are getting bigger and bigger	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
that uh they should vote it one way or the other so maybe it is worth having that extra little or	going	to the the very	#telephone#	telephone_sw2251-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know we're we're ashamed we're not	going	to do that anymore and uh yeah exactly	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do on it have  have not been world powers so it's easier for us to say you know to an Iraq you know uh you can't do this get back you know or we're	going	to force you whereas you know if the Soviet Union would've i don't know	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah or or we can do something about it yeah who knows what taking over Mongolia or or something like that who is really will we've been more just rhetoric uh rather than	going	in there officially uh or you know physically and try to to remove them um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum but i don't believe that he in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is	going	to be allowed to get away with it either yeah well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward you know just some some pretty hard by the socialism and uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

and that was the whole idea of why they had so many buffers and maybe you know more and more people are seeing or countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isn't	going	to help you you can like i guess like with uh Israel is a perfect example the reason they have the Angolan Heights and the yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

um-hum that's true well i was thinking too um we usually think of the Peace Corps as	going	overseas to do something but if they required this where you stay in the US and you know benefit the people here and perhaps too the fact that we have more elderly people now	#telephone#	telephone_sw2272-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well and probably too even those who might initially be opposed once they got into it then they you know would see that hey this this is giving me some benefit as well i mean they they might not express it in words so much but just sort of get in step with with uh what's	going	on and and really enjoy it um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2272-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

okay Jim um can you tell me a little bit about your opinions on capital punishment uh the bottom line that i after four years of working with the state prison system i've come to the conclusion if you're	going	to give the man the death sentence go ahead and fulfill the sentence understandably the Supreme Court says any time you hand down a death sentence to somebody they get a one appeal once that appeal fails within thirty days execute sentence	#telephone#	telephone_sw2294-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
go ahead and fulfill the sentence understandably the Supreme Court says any time you hand down a death sentence to somebody they get a one appeal once that appeal fails within thirty days execute sentence if you're	going	to give the man the death sentence don't keep the guy on death row for eight nine ten years and make him worry about it yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2294-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
now um what do you think about about the death penalty itself do you think that we should have a death penalty absolutely and i wish they would exercise it more thoroughly let the punishment fit the crime in this state we've got a very weird situation	going	on we're under federal supervision and i agree to a point i agree with how the system works in some respects in other ways i don't for first time offenders everybody's entitled to screw up once we'll give them the early release credits we'll give them the good time credits we'll give them the early parole	#telephone#	telephone_sw2294-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
but yet you get some of the jury trials and and it comes down to the nitty gritty when people are ready to condemn a person they always kind of forgive him a little bit nobody wants to put the finger on somebody and say well that's it you know we're	going	to kill you so it's got to be up to the judges i think we need we have to put into place judges that are stricter than the ones that are in there now	#telephone#	telephone_sw2294-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah um i i suspect the apathy is is due to something like people just feeling that that their vote doesn't count anyway i mean why why bother voting if um if your vote won't make a difference so for instance in um the last presidential election i'm sure a lot of people thought oh Bush is	going	to win either way why bother voting why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter that's right i think that's and and the other side of the coin is um people saying well if i really like the underdog candidate i still think they're not	going	to win so some are saying Dukakis is certainly not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i think on the local elections it's actually um i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because they feel like well you know the country's real important and you know if i elect if we help elect a president who's	going	to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know um and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah that that's possible i still think that that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference though as well i think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i'm just a little nobody my vote's not	going	to count anyway you know and i think that's probably a portion of the population that's massively under represented i i i would guess	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and their vote didn't count that's right but but it's the thought they all got out but you wonder if you know if if now the next election they have if only half of them are actually	going	to show up or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in Russia or any one shows up	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels or yeah it was i just took grades one through six i thought i was	going	to be smart and get the good kids wrong um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

um-hum and you don't know if you were reaching them or not but we felt like you know maybe just	going	ahead and try to teaching them was better trying to teach them was better than have them taken out yeah because uh that just that doesn't do a lot for them i mean it alleviates your problem but it doesn't do anything for them	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum and then at the end of the of a certain time period you spitted everything back out and the better uh memorizer you are the better your grades	going	to be yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

maybe on smaller smaller scales well i don't know i uh as much as i didn't like school when i was	going	through it from my perspective now i can see that it's a lot better	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

what is that what is it because of because of expense is that the uh costs are just	going	out of sight and and uh you know it's either increase the premiums or try to uh everybody work together to try to curtail the cost that's the way i see it	#telephone#	telephone_sw2363-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
huh the logical thing would have been had to go had it go to the the employee number so that's the one you're	going	to do the next action on the change you know and there's a lot of little things like that in there	#telephone#	telephone_sw2363-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

so well you're you're you're you you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose i suppose i do because i've seen a lot of those changes the the changes that women have had in the last generation well you know not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years	going	from well uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

and uh we'll see how the generations go huh but uh a really good day care is probably	going	to cost more than you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
also with uh with work for like three months and and so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer you know the technicians work the eight to five job and and know when they're	going	to be there yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah but uh if you're	going	to be more professional professional oriented then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah and so it was in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once um-hum so you figure one of these days you're	going	to go back to being an engineer is that what you think well actually i've found out that i'm not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

and i need it for the break  so yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and	going	out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah yeah i think that's the thing that were	going	to see well i think the biggest thing we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah i think that's the thing that were	going	to see well i think the biggest thing we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah so jobs have to i guess become more flexible i think they're really	going	to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah it's	going	to have to be both well so so that's another thing that has to adapt is you know the the the father's attitudes about you know whose whose job is this	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and uh and i think that's that's	going	to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls it's not they're not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah needed to be done they're	going	to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be cleaned um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah that's the thing if woman's role like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too and a lot of it's for the better some of the some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things	going	back to work and i want	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

oh there you go you can do much better i'm glad you're you're taking care of it yourself i i think trading it in they just use that as additional they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you're buying but they just are	going	to give you that much less for your trade in well that's fact	#telephone#	telephone_sw2439-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

um and maybe and i knew i wanted to be in engineering so i was looking for a good engineering school so i ended up	going	to Tech in Lubbock oh okay	#telephone#	telephone_sw2443-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh and it's and she's pretty happy i mean she's here she's finishing up her freshman year and she's pretty happy and likes Austin and i got a son though who is a senior at Berkner he is not academically inclined at all he's very uh kind of unacademically inclined he wants badly to go to Tech because that's where all all his friends in the neighborhood are	going	um	#telephone#	telephone_sw2443-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

right and that kind of thing i would i would if if you know what you're	going	to do i think that would be important to deal with too because when you then when you do try and get your foot in the door at the various companies the companies that you would possibly want to work for tend to interview more heavily at those locations because they know that that particular school had a good department	#telephone#	telephone_sw2443-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah i i i i think that's exactly right and you know a lot of girls that go into engineering know what they want to do uh you know i've got two daughters that started off	going	well well well my oldest thought she wanted to major in psychology and she's carried through on that uh uh Tracy is what in April of her freshman year and she's gone from political science to international studies to bilingual education to elementary education and fortunately as a as a freshman everything she's taken has has been uh is applicable	#telephone#	telephone_sw2443-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
will transfer so that's good yeah yeah it's it's it's applicable to those degrees and and and those are strong degrees all of them in in the school that she's	going	um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2443-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

but uh our policies seem to be pretty much one of uh you know trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource anyway that Salvador had  plenty of and that was people we didn't seem to be	going	in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's it's labor right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2446-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh of course we kind of concentrate on there wasn't much to take out of the country i felt like we're	going	in and taken all their um their gold or oil or bananas or coffee or anything like that because uh it just um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2446-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and have been back and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things and of course the savings and loan program um that was that you know that that just continued to grow in fact after my group i mean we were just a very small specialized group too to get that	going	and spread and then of course Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's uh uh something that nationalized very quickly and the same with the coops	#telephone#	telephone_sw2446-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

well i think it during this in this evolutionary theory that i have here that men will eventually evolve around to where they participate more in the home because when it gets to the point to where that the house is dirty and the kids are dirty and and mom's not home she's at work men are	going	to gradually learn how to do those kinds of things yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2453-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you know i really resent that in that i don't have that choice to be able to stay home with my child but uh i guess as long as you are single you have to support yourself nobody else is	going	to do it for you yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2453-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

uh-huh think that's	going	to happen in the next twenty years but uh you know i think that there's progress and i'm not very political so i don't really know you know any i don't know any statistics on you know how many women run for public office and how often they're defeated	#telephone#	telephone_sw2453-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah i don't know any statistics either but it's it's probably	going	to be the same type of situation that that uh the black people have gone through it took them well black men long time to to get up to the pay scales of the white man and now i think it it's feasible for a black man to be president	#telephone#	telephone_sw2453-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah that's true that's true that's what scares me when you get into that type of situation you know if you are	going	to change it watch out for the person that's changing it they may put another loophole in that um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2454-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
wasn't even there to begin with yeah and and and people like us never hear about about what's really	going	on and what they what they're really doing and i think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of time because they're there to sell newspapers that's the problem with the news both the on television and the paper	#telephone#	telephone_sw2454-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

right job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know they may be	going	to school or may have elderly parents or you know all sorts of other things yeah it it seems too me like though women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore the women are spreading themselves thinner	#telephone#	telephone_sw2455-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

what they were you know what they were looking for in other words if if in Spring crain training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do um then it really doesn't give you any indication but if they were uh playing the people that they're	going	to play then that might be pretty good indication so you know it's it's it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just you know come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring craning training and then gone on a you know fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season so	#telephone#	telephone_sw2460-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something i mean that's the only thing that i can figure out because i've heard so many people say well i'm not	going	on voting on that one you know i i'm	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
absolutely and and they are doing that in a number of schools however probably not enough of them uh country wide but it's	going	to take at least a whole generation of people uh to get across the idea of voting uh just like it's taking a whole generation of people to finally uh realize the harmfulness of drugs	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

it's uh it's just a sad situation and uh i do think more needs to be done along that line to help to uh teach the people uh uh everyone uh more about what is	going	on with voting and with non voting so that uh we can make some start making some more intelligent decisions and it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

really wow that's amazing because i would have thought that it would be better to wait a little bit nah so it's sort of an old wife or common folk tales about you know if you're	going	to have a cat spayed let it go through heat first not true because when they go into heat their uh genetic parts swell up and expand and everything and then once you do take them into surgery it's a little more difficult easier to have them spayed before they even go into heat	#telephone#	telephone_sw2517-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yes i definitely agree  there's no doubt about that i uh i i mean i can relate to that because i'm i'm	going	to college right now and i feel like i mean i'm taking this history class and i mean it's so boring and i just hate it  and i think why do they make us take this stuff i mean what does this have to do with getting you know a computer science degree or whatever you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw2589-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
but a lot of kids i mean if a child has uh claustrophobia i mean that's just	going	to terrify him you know and if if the isolation concept really works that good why are our prisons overcrowded	#telephone#	telephone_sw2589-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
when i was brought brought up if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough you were	going	to get spanked well then the extreme came in and now we can no longer spank them so we now isolate them right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2589-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

well see to me that's positive reinforcement is much better much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids because they're	going	to be good and try and earn those things you know to get the positive part of it i mean they'd rather much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked so they're definitely	#telephone#	telephone_sw2589-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

oh yeah yeah i think the government is it's own worst enemy about the time it was all	going	on they were trying to run a loose monetary policy anyhow to stimulate the economy and plus they had cut back on the way of government regulators to even investigate or keep a watchdog on the whole industry and uh i think the whole economic situation was set up to uh put the savings and loans in the position they were in and they mainly the banks too	#telephone#	telephone_sw2591-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh monitoring in that respect then it did get out of hand and you're right you're absolutely right there were some people who saw the situation for what it was and they took advantage of it and uh because of it you and i are the main taxpayers now are	going	to have to pay not only for the burden of the bad investments that they made but we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2591-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

uh Texas is on basically on the way to recovery as far as uh the banking industry goes and they oh i'm glad to hear that because i've been concerned that the banks may be	going	the same direction that the savings and loans primarily because uh what got the savings and loans in trouble is the same sort of things that's beginning to get the banks in trouble and that was uh the real estate uh backing in investment and just building in general backing contractors and those kinds of uh corporations	#telephone#	telephone_sw2591-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

well do you think maybe it's peaked you think yeah yeah i don't think there's	going	to be that many more of them i i would so you you you you would uh predict based on at least your knowledge and experience that in time we'll see the numbers of banks and maybe savings and loans too if they're still failing	#telephone#	telephone_sw2591-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

uh like the things that uh i forget the guy's name downtown here uh was involved in those two banks i think that was in Georgia or someplace uh what what what how do see that this this indebtedness of which is bad loans and the like just not	going	to get paid back at least by the people who caused the debt uh you you can't just write that off completely you can write off a certain part of it i guess but you just can't just write off the whole somewhere along the line you've got to recoup some of that money some of the even if it's twenty five to fifty cents on the dollar	#telephone#	telephone_sw2591-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

it's it's hard for me to imagine that a a situation of you know take it to it's logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying guns you're not	going	to have an increase in gunfire i actually it's not it's more of a police action in itself the fact that everybody's packing a piece is a deterrent is a deterrence to someone saying well i'm	#telephone#	telephone_sw2634-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

that's true if if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket and sometimes you may think well i don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something yeah yeah and it gives you a sense um a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say oh well i don't have to pay for it now but you're	going	to have to pay for it and it seems like yeah you think well i don't have it now but payday will come and then i'll have the money but that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time  yes	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

but it this is her first credit card thing well when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal look at this they sent me this money you know so then when i explained to her look you have to pay this back and they are	going	to charge you interest and stuff of course she ter tore it up but a lot of parents would not take the time you know and they wouldn't even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and i are	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i have seen so many people and i have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen she got uh i can't remember what she called it it's some kind of maybe it's sure or something like that it's something it's some weird name of a credit card and she is charging out of her mind already and i'm	going	you just got off uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i mean i cannot hardly tolerate to owe something like you know i guess it's just because i've been brought up like that but um i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was	going	to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to pay out but that's just the way i feel about it	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you know you just have to have these things just you know have them at home have to have them at my own place and that's you know a big expenditure to start um buying all these things that you think or or have to have and actually they're kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place you know	going	in one big swoop save up and then buy it right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

i think also you know um dialogue between university professors helps a lot in decisions because i think that's what really turned me towards that you know the the school that i'm	going	to is i went and talked to the people in the school and they gave me information which i could not have gotten otherwise and that that really finalized my decision um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2644-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum um-hum so i'm kind of branching off into a pretty specific region which i think is	going	to be a hot topic in the future with you know all these lands and and things that are being spoiled no question	#telephone#	telephone_sw2644-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so are you happy with what you're doing now yeah i am kind of happy with it it it's getting better all the time i knew it would be different from the very beginning but you know as as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's	going	on with the system so i was in the computer operations it's uh you know it all starts to become similar there's you know there's benefits and there's things that weren't as good but as an overall package i'd say i i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out	#telephone#	telephone_sw2645-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or or	going	for walks in the mountains i can't seem to get into it right now exactly	#telephone#	telephone_sw2645-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah funny how that happens after kids right that uh those type of qualities have uh moved into the picture and then there's there's some economic concern but usually it's if if it's	going	to be a night out it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah they do oddly enough even being near near the gulf uh they tend to advertise the the main the whole east coast uh seafood for some reason it tends to be a draw i don't know particularly why i mean to me it tastes pretty much the same once you do to it whatever you're	going	to do to it you know like oh is that right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and um but not as often we don't do it as often um and what i'm finding now is they're finally getting to the age where we're venturing into	going	again with them and of course when you take them though you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

i i i tend to agree with you too we look for more um uh quiet type more of a subdued atmosphere now and i think part of that is after you have kids you're you're not as interested in	going	to uh Georgetown type places where you know you go in every place and there's a lot of uh noise right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and um not all of them do take reservations either so so you sometimes have to allot yourself uh enough time um you know to go out uh you can't figure on	going	out and being back in two hours you know um the other thing that's changing here is because of the um the age set here uh a lot mostly people in they're i'd say late twenties to early forties in these neighborhoods that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um to children and making half price menus for them whereas before um they would be totally discouraged from bringing children in and they're doing this basically because they're so many working parents in this area and that they were losing the business because once all these younger people were having children they weren't	going	to the restaurants right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

right being as worldly as i could possibly be  getting into as many organizations as i could possibly could and and one other point i was	going	to make was that i can understand i can see that probably if i had gone to a smaller school i would probably have more friends	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

you know what she what she wants anyway but that was the big deal and in in that case uh regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was	going	for what she needed and finding a school that that met her specific requirements and and made the best fit for her right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and that that's another point is that the a parent should tell their child to be or or to give their child the leeway to choose their school not so much choose the school for them but you know kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're	going	to do yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

right it's just hard to make yourself go and i i think one thing i don't like about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night and i've been sweaty and and it you know i don't really feel like	going	in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands so it kind of kills the yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
does it cost the same for just two nights or no it's less expensive this one was only forty five dollars but i'm glad it's not too totally cheap because if it was too c heap i would talk myself out of	going	more probably well that's good too	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah yeah it's right there and it's they have a really nice facility at the TI they've got two different aerobics rooms they have the mirrors of course sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall you don't like to see how you work but i guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get	going	but no	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

and and the way they keep proposing fixing that is to raise taxes spend more money i think what would cure that problem is to consolidate some of these schools and they wouldn't have so much money	going	to so many different schools yeah well that plus that fact that you look into the we've got some very good private schools here and more and more people are sending their children private schools and what you look in the private schools is they've got a higher proportion of people on the payroll that are teaching	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh and and get them in the classroom plus uh i don't know it seems to me that that more so than when i went to school there are a lot of courses that aren't	going	allow first first of all they're not college prep courses and i don't think they're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well now if they propose this the if this you know state income tax goes through are they	going	to lower the sales tax i don't know i i don't i bet they're not i i'll absolutely bet they're not it it's interesting i wish i knew this question was coming up because i've only heard of it in bits and pieces	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

and it is five bedrooms she said you you it's really hard to find that and most places places have four and there are people that really want five so that's another plus so it might be closer to three months and you know we'll be if we're real lucky we won't lose any money you know we'll we'll be able it's mostly the closing costs that are	going	to um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2705-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum that you we can we'll be be uh asking for more than we bought the house for three years ago but the closing costs are	going	to eat out just about all of it so so maybe you can get enough to cover that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2705-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

right uh-huh you know so you it's	going	to be much faster of course you know the classical thing for the handicapped too person who can't type very fast or	#telephone#	telephone_sw2707-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum which of course again which mean would mean again our education budget will go down if this is in a few years i mean it's not	going	to be overnight yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2708-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and they go to college etcetera well it seems to me that kids that are get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in	going	to college and forced into it usually are your drop outs where if they're said hey it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like	#telephone#	telephone_sw2708-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh my perception of the budget you know the government and they have so much to spend and there's not enough money to spread around but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries and that we have more money or goods you know more money	going	out and too many goods coming into this country you know  and um you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country	#telephone#	telephone_sw2708-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and and obviously the the demand for their goods is quite high here so they can get their goods in here and um you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know we're	going	to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours but um	#telephone#	telephone_sw2708-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
they're in i think you're you're	going	to find that just because the United States you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh uh the money you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell you know we don't uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2708-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and it's kind it really is kind of scary because there's there's just oodles of them and you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals and it's kind it's kind of scares me not that i don't want them here and not that i don't appreciate the fact that you know that they have rights too but  on the other hand you feel like almost they're they're invading us to the point where they're	going	to take over right actually my son once said that that perhaps um what we should do is is buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest and and that might be the solution	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and you know they're just extremely bright kids and also they value learning i was	going	to say i'm not sure i i would guess that it's not that they are any brighter but they just maybe work harder or well i i think things come easy for them too but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States i don't	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well and exactly that's exactly true plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them and and uh plus a lot of American dollars but in in the long run maybe that's	going	to make a better world too you know you just don't know right right exactly	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

that's true that's true and in England at least at the time i was familiar with it about ten years ago they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was	going	to be no oh so you don't get any choices at all or anything	#telephone#	telephone_sw2716-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right which is ridiculous and right and so no matter what happens to me if i get in to a car accident this afternoon i have no idea you know  no way of being able to afford the outrageous medical cost because my insurance is now only eighty percent of what ever it's	going	to be yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2716-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

uh-huh and that's you know that's the way they wanted to do it and he was surprised because he thought there was	going	to be a problem because he uh you know some people on the case were were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but i mean when it all came down they just	#telephone#	telephone_sw2717-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life that you know you never know when they're	going	to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not yeah yeah i agree	#telephone#	telephone_sw2717-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right because i'm like you i'm not	going	to have a balance on that thing because it's too easy i know too many people that pay off that card well i've got this credit card well maybe i'd better use that one or something like that and i'm saying huh-uh not me	#telephone#	telephone_sw2718-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

how it doesn't it does inconvenience you but it could save lives i think is the way we look at it here and we're seeing so many murders um  between uh in in Washington DC well do you think though that i mean if you have to wait seven days in order to purchase a gun are they really	going	to do these background checks and and if they really well i think the i think the long run is is to get um	#telephone#	telephone_sw2721-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah yeah well i don't yeah that's right i don't i don't know i guess maybe the trick with the pads on the ceiling is that you have to put a minimal amount of paint on there you probably aren't	going	to be able to cover as much of a surface as you would if you're doing it on a wall because if it drips you can just sort of smooth it all out uh right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2748-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah it's ridiculous but the thing the quandary that i'm in is that that we had a great big article in in in the newspaper last week about i've been real big about	going	to to the store and asking for paper instead of plastic well right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
see that much of a problem as opposed to a petroleum product i mean tree trees can grow back if if they're handled in the correct way but the petroleum products like plastic i mean they're	going	to run out of oil whatever they're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
be a part of a yeah a world that's halfway decent and you know just in my lifetime i've seen such a change in the environment and it's scary because by the time my kids have kids and they're growing up it's	going	to be a completely different world you know and it's it's scary so yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you could easily say well we should go back to living in caves but no one's	going	to do that so i think you need to make compromises slowly enough people adjust to it and uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i don't know i guess it's just me but i don't know whether to trust that or not i mean there are so many scams and things	going	on you know i would love to help somebody i know	#telephone#	telephone_sw2803-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

or biology department one or the other anyway uh and anyway he just he went and found this guy in in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one in i guess in Texas in Mexico i don't know where but anyway he brought this home and i looked at him and i said you've got to be kidding i'm not	going	to live with a lizard  but you know i visualize that animal racing about and you know like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that they're very much like uh well the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes	#telephone#	telephone_sw2806-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right and it's much less than clear to me that as a military power um there's	going	to be anything left uh given that anything like that happens right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um and they so so i guess since the primary question is whether or not it's a military problem that's less than clear to me i mean if they're smart they're just	going	to let us head toward communism on our own very merry way that's right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i see i don't think they're	going	to you know somehow import communism to us i i agree with that i don't believe that will happen	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah oh well so that's uh what what's	going	to be real interesting is if when they have the next presidential elections um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum if Bush is	going	to run with Quayle again yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah or if he's	going	to run with someone else which i think would be uh i wonder if that's if there's precedent for that where uh there's uh same president but a different vice president uh i think so i can't think off hand who	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum uh and uh that's i you know i'd love to see that happen but i doubt it's	going	to happen in the next fifty years you don't think so	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
personally i i i really as i said i would really love to see it happen but i just i just i can't see them maintaining the missile bases in fact i think if the Soviet government starts retreating you know because of these civil wars and stuff the first thing they're	going	to do is close down the mi ssile bases in the republics um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh under the fear because they're not	going	to want them to fall into the Republic's hands i see under the fear that that uh Moscow Moscow gets bombed first that's a good point that's a very good point in fact	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
might be used against them that's right and so i think just from that there's	going	to be some limited amounts of disarmament they'll still be republics with the missiles the ones that are under the firmer control of the of the Soviets right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh really nevertheless it's not exactly the thing that's	going	to make you bucks right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so you know so there's that end of it too and and i think it's	going	to really you know so i don't	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah it sure	going	to make a big difference in our school system yeah it is	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh in order to accommodate the extra teaching that's	going	to be needed because they're eliminating all aids	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
because they're eliminating all aids they're	going	to they all aids all paid aids everything is	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

and restructuring stuff families yeah you know go out and do what they want to do but i think that um society's	going	to really have to get used to it and they're not quite used to it yet and that's i right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right um-hum i mean i'm the typical baby boomer i hate that term but in terms of women  women	going	out i mean twenty three i remember that uh-huh  yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah you want to establish and and get there quick and then worry about you know because right now in my career i'm i'm really starting out and it's	going	to take me a while to move up and i don't need anything kind of holding me back um um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

um-hum finally to a point where i mean i don't know why i didn't didn't do it sooner but this is probably typical of the women's movement too the idea that you're	going	to be forty tomorrow anyway if you want to go back to school i'm seriously considering	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
it's true i mean it's it's you know and so i'm	going	i'm so old and i'm i i really have to always tell myself no you're not you're very young and you know so it's no you're extremely yeah it's it's just well it's like us we're getting ready to do if possible for an adoption and i have friends that say well why would you do that if you know you haven't been able to children which we do know why would you do that now at this part point and um	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

well that's that's something um yeah we have it's a very timely subject i think in the Spring everybody decides that they're	going	to start over and do something with their house and we started last year an we have a little i guess it's a sixteen hundred foot house and it's just my husband and i here but um we decided that uh we wanted to build a sun room	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i don't know i i guess you get this idea that everything should be perfect and you know what this isn't a perfect world no however i do think that a lot of times contractors try to get out of doing things that they say they're	going	to do and uh it	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well i was real happy with our contractor um actually i wasn't happy with the contractor i was happy with the job foreman so i think that made all the difference because he was pretty um you know concerned about how it looked and and you know how it should be done the right way and he gave us a lot of clues you just wish you knew all this stuff	going	in that um it was funny because we didn't understand a lot of things that we had to do in addition to this you know like the tape and bedding and and doing finishing off this wall and that wall that wasn't in the contract you know kind of thing	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i want someone to do it for me and uh just trying to get them to do what they say they're	going	to do is a real effort yeah well we've taken this another step further this year we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and uh just trying to get them to do what they say they're	going	to do is a real effort yeah well we've taken this another step further this year we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
they're screws the self adhesive screws all right yeah those and so they're not	going	to split and and i was really concerned about bugs really when i when we were considering other types of wood because you know termites can be a real hazard around here you have to pretty much spray them regularly you know under an and around or whatever so you want to leave yourself uh enough space to get under it or or be able to lift it up	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well it is it's it's a frightening experience the one thing you might do if he will deliver the boards that he is	going	to make the under structure with it sure is	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
huh-uh now the third part is and it was supposed to have started in May but something and i don't remember the exact reason from Persian Gulf um trickle down fouled that up and so now we're not	going	to do that until end of June but then they will give us another container that where we will put everything recyclable glass plastic right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2815-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

no question about it well i just you know i'm really glad to see us a world coming back to this and yeah it's really coming to a head it's been building up for a few years i remember this	going	on when i was a teenager sure sure	#telephone#	telephone_sw2815-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh that's a consideration too but i don't know it it would be a really rough choice to make you depending on the parent their personality and your own family and what's	going	on with i'm home all day anyway with the young kids but if i was working you know full time and had to give up a career that would be another you know problem too but	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
it it would really be hard because when we go to visit i'm sure places have you know their best foot forward kind of thing unless you drop in frequently and kind of get the since of what's	going	on behind the scenes it would really be hard to know it's kind of similar in away to some of the things you look for in	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i thought how how neat you know that you can have a place where you can you know go down together and have dinner with other people because if your living alone the isolation and the depression and all those other factors should be taken into consideration too so i thought you know they should have dorms for older people they had activities	going	on all the time and you know it was really a much more comfortable lifestyle i could imagine for an older person so yeah i think that would be great if they had places like that yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

or she maybe maybe it's just a preference that she's taking it on herself but she is taking a computer class yeah and uh but yeah it's that's something that's	going	to be uh a necessity for accountants because you you know it's you can do so much for more work with a computer then you can do you know doing it manually yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2822-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
but you know and so we try not to even take that as part of our budget we just try to put that right away in savings it's very difficult sometimes to to not think and say well God we have a little bit in savings let's you know but you have to be quite um adamant and say you're not	going	to touch that so yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

i i project ahead i usually at the end of the month when i when i pay the bills i'll usually project what i'm	going	to need for next month but i don't really put it aside i just you know i just try to estimate what i think it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and within about a month i would say i had ten fifteen calls from different brokers uh asking me questions all sorts of things about what i would be willing interested in investing in and how much i had to invest and and i was kind of curious and i guess i got my answer but it was uh a bit much and to this day it has continued considerably it's i guess it's	going	to be hard to get off of that little list now yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
credit references uh when you dial that in to find out well what's their latest rating uh that kind of information you don't always want everybody to know but uh it's	going	across uh computer lines and people can pick up what they want so right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right uh you know you name anything that's ever happened to you is	going	to be tied into either your social security number or your driver's license it's kind of sad that they choose that number to identify you  with because there's very few you know some people use it just because it's easy and it's unique and then some people use it to yeah you can now identify that person it's not quite so private anymore	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and uh i don't know i very little of the information i give out really bothers me but as far as whether i care if anybody else had it but uh i guess the idea that if you ever let it become a an all right thing to do for the masses then you'll never be able to get that privilege back  once gone it's	going	to be gone forever right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

could very well be oh oh well i was wondering how that that worked because it's like you know we'll pay you for and i'm	going	wait a minute you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw2987-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
that's right but i mean you have kids you have kids	going	to school with guns knives that's that's from the home but you know it's i don't know i guess parents aren't and i think the school i think	#telephone#	telephone_sw2988-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i think uh i don't know what the solution is if the government doesn't know how are the um there's somebody that needs to rise up and have a plan that is	going	to resolve the many issues that are facing the public school system and i wouldn't know where to start since i haven't been involved in the public school system that much	#telephone#	telephone_sw2988-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
gone through that uh i remember my parents didn't do all those type things and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that and even now with my grandchildren i feel it's a very important thing to be done right because if uh kids don't look up to you or or can't can't feel they can spend time with you they're	going	to find someone else and uh yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2989-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah and so uh we never could agree on what we were	going	to listen to after we got married because i'd want to listen hear country and he'd want to hear rock and we couldn't get along because his rock was too rock for me i like soft rock but i don't like some of the heavy metal stuff he was listening to yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2990-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum so all that music brings back a lot of memories you know and i'm always thinking oh i'd like to have one of those albums but since we made this agreement that we're	going	to listen to Christian music i think oh well i'll probably set it on the shelf and  would never you know play it let's see	#telephone#	telephone_sw2990-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and you have to you know be familiar with the like there're so many different software packages it you have to be familiar with the one that you're	going	to be using most um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2991-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right exactly how many lines you're	going	to use in it and uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2991-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right they typeset they don't usually break words in a newspaper if the if one line is	going	to be a lot shorter than another line they just they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2991-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
but some of them are and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that it that just a a basic general user can understand them so i think um people think it's	going	to take them a lot longer to learn it properly than it really would and so they're really wasting time rather than saving themselves time because they think well it's quicker just to do it myself when it's really not right um-hum it's better to learn it directly from the manual	#telephone#	telephone_sw2991-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum it's kind of nice to know that they're just	going	to be seeing you know not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff and they usually right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2992-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum um-hum my son older son he's	going	to be five and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now so oh that's true that's true well i noticed that my kids are uh older now they're uh getting close to the teenage years but they did we watched all of Mister Rogers and everything but even some of your uh cartoons can be very violent	#telephone#	telephone_sw2992-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh so that's really funny  but uh we've gotten uh-huh go ahead i  i was just	going	to say i know that at least before our kids were born we used to always enjoy watching the Cosby Show Thursday nights usually had pretty good with that and as far as um very good comedy	#telephone#	telephone_sw2992-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah oh definitely  seems like although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe there'll be a day that they're	going	to uh enact this i think uh the um other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling so they keep trying to say we may need a uh state income tax	#telephone#	telephone_sw2996-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah i guess maybe if i was	going	to buy a car or something maybe i would consider where i was buying it to try to you know save a little bit on that sales tax because on a car that really matters kind of mounts up um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2996-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh i thought i was	going	to do that Christmas eve and i couldn't find hardly anything open  after five o'clock in the afternoon and i was oh i was i really i really was stuck were you shocked like oh no i'm stuck i need to buy stuff	#telephone#	telephone_sw2996-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

oh i like to think about that after you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go is that all that's in there i don't think's it's	going	to pay too long when i get out um we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago um	#telephone#	telephone_sw3001-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

uh oh no a little bit that worries me because i feel like the news is so biased and yes they report facts and yes you can get an idea of what's	going	on but oh yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3002-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so i guess news is just part of that rat race for me and my wife and i feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own it's always there's something	going	on all the time uh you don't really have time to sit down and yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3002-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you know well i guess we're	going	to talk about children today okay let's do it	#telephone#	telephone_sw3004-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah the one that said she was never getting married and never	going	to have any children  so she uh she spends a lot of quality time i think when she is with with the children oh is that  is that right	#telephone#	telephone_sw3004-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and uh she she also had a small child she brought with her and it did not work out uh at all  it she thought it was	going	to she was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out in the morning but uh uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3004-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum yeah yeah uh it worked out good i'm	going	to i've decided i'm	#telephone#	telephone_sw3004-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh since they'll be	going	back at the end of the month and that's great	#telephone#	telephone_sw3004-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yep but when those when those people leave uh the power's	going	to go um there isn't really anything here because we're not really big enough so the economy is	#telephone#	telephone_sw3005-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

oh i can't even remember which of the companies it is but they've they've got a they've got a tilt rotor uh plane that they've developed and they want to sell but developed for the defense department department and defense department is saying well no we we don't we don't really need it it's	going	to be too expensive and it's not	#telephone#	telephone_sw3005-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
hm i may be concerned about the number of calories that are	going	into the spread i know i watch my weight and i'm sure that most of my friends do too and i appreciate somebody being conscious of that when i go visit so i do try to cook more healthy than i did even five years ago five years ago i let my palate dictate uh now i'm more conscious along with everybody else	#telephone#	telephone_sw3006-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right everything to an extreme and i'm not	going	to take the flavor and the pleasure out of the food in order to make it quote healthy i'd rather die than eat terrible tasting food right	#telephone#	telephone_sw3006-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh well of course now we're	going	to find out two years down the road that we've done something terrible and our body is	#telephone#	telephone_sw3006-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and i've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb dumb retrievers and i'm and i really fear for the breed because i love that breed but i really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's	going	to be ruined yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3007-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah they did i i had never really had a golden retriever before we were	going	to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband's family had had shepherds and all the other we looked at some of shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very uh social and stuff and we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down and one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling  and that was mine	#telephone#	telephone_sw3007-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
even um uh police corps which started you know finding other breeds to use because this thing this this thing known as a German shepherd here its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible so about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were	going	to change this so they went back to Europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred	#telephone#	telephone_sw3007-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh that's right yes because it just keeps	going	an up up and up there too but uh there's	#telephone#	telephone_sw3008-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah uh my son has worked for a company for about six year he graduated from college what in eighty six so five years this fall and he started out with they had a Four O One K plan and he asked me if he should get into it and i said well very small amount uh you can put in there and you keep adding to it and they're	going	to match it or so and um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw3008-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum so she was	going	on those two instincts just the same i know myself i never and i was very very protective on who babysit my children oh i would be too	#telephone#	telephone_sw3009-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh you you learn a lot by	going	in there and they explain they explain to you you know what their day consists of and what their general rules are and um that's you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw3009-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right right and then you know i mean even at that you have to consider the logistics of it you know i mean you're not	going	to take your child south of town if you work north uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3009-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
true that's true um i i'm a very selective watcher i i look at the TV section and decide what i'm	going	to watch and watch it but as a rule i don't sort of  stroll around the dial and yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3010-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh okay well here we go i guess we're	going	to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that are that did some stuff over in the Gulf um yeah no did you push one oh okay okay well then i think it i just started doing this so i don't know too much about it	#telephone#	telephone_sw3012-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and that's the way the course that they should go i mean you know we can maybe help them a little bit prompt them but i don't think this intervention at such high levels should be	going	on the the thing with Israel and Palestine i believe that should be settled between them and also um you know the other thing is their idea or our idea idea of democracy has nothing to do with them	#telephone#	telephone_sw3012-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah and that's if you know if somewhere in there someone's	going	to have to learn a different way that's yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3012-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i i i just think you know you're right and i think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along it's not	going	to be that we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw3012-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
that's right um you know there are political boundaries and those are man made boundaries but you know for heaven sakes that's something that's been	going	on for ages and and i i think so much of it is what you're taught	#telephone#	telephone_sw3012-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

you know we could learn to talk about things and i think that's good yeah that really is it keeps the family in touch with what's	going	on with each other yeah i think	#telephone#	telephone_sw3013-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh uh-huh and if they're	going	to have other kids over then then they help and we make real simple things you know those oh i don't i don't know if you've ever made them maybe not since you don't have kids yet but those JELL-O uh gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers i can't think of what they call it	#telephone#	telephone_sw3013-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and that and i'd rather have a Maxima than a Cadillac i really would it's not necessarily prestige but it's comfort uh there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're	going	to pay that kind of money for a car uh uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3014-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah oh wow we like the stuff that glitters good there's nothing wrong with that actually i think probably if i were	going	to get uh if i were	#telephone#	telephone_sw3014-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh um-hum but if i'm	going	to be traveling in that car for any period of time i want some real good classical music i love classical music and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw3014-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh the reason i quite was just because the the doctor a a certain doctor that we enjoyed enjoyed	going	to was no longer associated with that HMO so we my wife decided she wanted to to stay with that doctor so  we went to the to the yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3015-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah because they don't have to worry about	going	in and and paying uh seventy five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes	#telephone#	telephone_sw3015-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right the horror stories that you hear about people	going	into the hospital for a week and uh it being a four thousand dollar bill well they and then again they're also  they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay you know they they get a lot of uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3015-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right a lot of uh people who are just just have to be there and can't afford it and so they they know they're not	going	to get paid you know get money from them so they yeah yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3015-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and so that's one way one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by uh okay if you'll shorten your stay then we will uh waive the deductible right our our insurance is uh is doing something similar where they're also	going	to more	#telephone#	telephone_sw3015-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i think that is so stupid you know because oh i'm guilty of that sometimes because i've called and there really wasn't any significant message and i and i wasn't	going	to be available to be called back uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3016-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

that circulates and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top and then that's the way it's kept in order and then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is	going	on and when you meet them at the reunion you don't feel like i don't know anything about this person you've you've read something about what is	#telephone#	telephone_sw3067-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

i hate to talk to the parents because um one of the reasons is because you know the kid doesn't know exactly what they want and i always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not	going	to be your career vocation because you'll get better grades i i think most employers would probably rather hire you know a a three six in um  in history uh to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
that make sense yeah i always you know tell them that you should major in something you you're	going	to get good grades in because that that's always i think more important yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah i i i i think that the biggest problem is uh with the uh with the the home environment being part of it you know if i think too many parents expect uh the the school to teach uh the moral aspects of of things to the students to the kids and you know while we're not	going	to worry about uh teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then uh expect them to to pick it up at school and you're not	going	to do that you know you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
the uh schools like that that where you got a lot of kids who are basically uh that might be more well to well off you know	going	to a private Catholic school or whatever uh and and they're not all that way but you know some that are um yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah that they're they're they're not quite the same as as the kids that are	going	to the inner city uh you know public schools yeah this is interesting because i in my mind i don't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment but uh this this was actually inner city	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
they didn't send him to a public school you know you have like you said you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance well you know in a lot of cases uh like that where you know if kids are	going	to a public parochial school like that it's it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving them uh uh an education it shows i think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know and that may be	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh i think that's a big part of it you know people you know if you don't care about property and people you know you're not	going	to care about uh about learning i think	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

they were the ones that caused it or whatever but to me when you do the crime then you should pay for whatever you did and and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge i don't i don't think that's right because all's that's	going	to do is say oh well you know that was a breeze i can go out and do it again and you know yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3113-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah of what's	going	on that so that's and i don't know you know i i think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know are they put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh i don't know that that looks that bad but if you're	going	to tell the kids they can have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too yeah it it i see that the i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers i think	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're	going	there you don't want to dress too tacky because you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well and you always course it's a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today or there there's or you're	going	to be observed there's usually yeah there's usually something	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
or you're	going	to be observed there's usually yeah there's usually something	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
really and i don't know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the kids i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and i don't think we'll ever get to that no i don't think i think we're	going	the opposite direction it's the parochial schools that i guess many times they've had uniforms for years i really don't really know if they still do you don't think so	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

so it and then i think that's	going	to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do yeah i i don't think a lot of teachers are very professional but	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah i think that for me it's	going	to be one of those things yes i want to make sure it has a good education but i also want to keep it small enough that you can enjoy it because Texas to me was almost too big yeah i've heard that from people who have gone to Texas yeah i went to uh Iowa State which is also a big eight school like Oklahoma	#telephone#	telephone_sw3117-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

and we have so many people already you know the jails are already overloaded well the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous i mean if one is determined that it's you know that he feels that he's you know	going	against the other eleven they all stay until everyone agrees so i don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting you know just gives in	#telephone#	telephone_sw3118-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

i wish ah that's something that i think that has been lost in families and i think that's a good place to start again uh yeah i would have to start in the families first because if you don't it for your for your own immediate family your sure not	going	to do it for anybody else yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3133-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

what happens when public education fails you know will then people go to private schools you know well what kind of a situation do they get there and what are you know and what kind of state are we in if if most people are	going	to private schools well i think uh one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world	#telephone#	telephone_sw3134-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right right yeah that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never	going	to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff uh-huh yeah that is um a big drawback i think in that in the uh public schools out here	#telephone#	telephone_sw3135-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah and with our budget cuts i'm sure that's not	going	to well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're	#telephone#	telephone_sw3135-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and with our budget cuts i'm sure that's not	going	to well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're	#telephone#	telephone_sw3135-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're	going	to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are	#telephone#	telephone_sw3135-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right right but i  i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are	going	to have to work two income families i think are here to stay uh-huh uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3135-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh you know the the people that work in big business have families they have children so it's only to their advantage that they get these programs	going	and working and uh right yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3135-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

isn't that something yeah i was	going	to say my kids both eat it i guess that's one thing that i particularly like um but i think it's good for you know for for company too and i've made it a few times um and you can make a lot at one time uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3138-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yes yes and i think uh it's becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while i think home schooling's always been around but uh i can see more and more families	going	to it because of the problems in the schools um and a lot of it is discipline problems yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3140-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i don't know something's got to change with the schools that's what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway when they're young well i think it's	going	to have to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else the home is the base yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3140-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum well i'm thinking of a next time about	going	back to a dog though because the cats really do shed a lot you just never get rid of the cat hair do they	#telephone#	telephone_sw3141-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
we never back then you didn't spay and neuter your animals that much you just kind of put up with whatever happened and she could never get rid of them fast enough before the next litter came along it wasn't usual unusual for us to have six and seven cats and i remember my first camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of them that were	going	to be award winning type  photos they've always been a part of my life well i guess so you've had them so you had them just from early on then	#telephone#	telephone_sw3141-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right especially if you really do get attached to them i'm i'm already kind of preparing for Prissy dying because she's pretty old and fat and oh i just know it's	going	to come sooner or later so that's one reason i've been letting Emily talk about dogs because i think uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3141-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh we we say that's	going	to be the end but i think when it really comes to it we'll want another pet how old is Prissy	#telephone#	telephone_sw3141-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal and sometimes it's i enjoy	going	out having a formal meal yes	#telephone#	telephone_sw3142-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right and uh not in Plano  of course  but we really we really do enjoy	going	out and uh and i'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally backfires no i don't think so you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw3142-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so yeah that that is really one of our it's almost a hobby with us well i think that it's just that's exactly  sometimes i think	going	out to eat it's it's sort of a recreation yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3142-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
how about you yeah well i live outside of Dallas and it's kind of in a little suburb so i feel pretty safe out here but i know the murder rate is	going	up every year yeah i uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3143-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i know it they have all sorts of of rights that you know are questionable maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes yeah i think so i think if they knew it was	going	to be really horrible wherever they were	#telephone#	telephone_sw3143-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
that's the other thing uh is it's hard to even i can't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be especially if you're an inner city you know you can't really feel like you're putting much of a dent in what's	going	on and you're putting your life on your on the line everyday yeah Dallas they were saying in Dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen but they keep losing them all the time and that uh you know eventually we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw3143-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

okay all right well i guess you know i i wasn't expecting that question about AIDS so i haven't thought too much about it but i guess i think that we should have more research um i'm just concerned that it's just	going	to be such a major health problem yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3149-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah and if we you know and if it's not i say it would seem to me the sooner we take care of it the better off we're	going	to be right because it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse	#telephone#	telephone_sw3149-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

um they have no other alternatives i suppose um well i i don't know i mean i just but then i think well uh yeah i guess that basically i do think we just need more research because that's	going	to sort of be the our only answer well yeah that's right and they've got to do something about it they can't put it on the back burner	#telephone#	telephone_sw3149-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

um does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs no but one thing that to to me was um	going	on stretching it a little too far was that they also check um if you're taking somebody else's prescription drug you know it happens a lot of times like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever and you know then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the you know doctor and get another prescription	#telephone#	telephone_sw3372-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and less money to do it with that's true and a lot of it lot of it has to do with uh salaries too speaking of money because if you can't pay the right people you know they're not	going	to be able to do they're not not gonna get the people that can do a good job all right yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3375-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

uh two wrongs don't make a right i think its	going	to be very interesting because its uh yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3765-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i think you need to get tough with them and quit calling them i don't think they need air conditioned cells and color TV sets they need to be put on hard labor manual and as tough as you can make it no coddling no kissing their and nothing nothing just say hey you committed a wrong and you're	going	to serve some hard hard time well there are a lot of people who think that that works pretty well and it'll be interesting to see what uh what we go to because it's uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3765-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah oh yeah it's well known and and it's consistent with what you're talking about in terms of the uh approach to uh the uh you know the people once they get through the trials and i guess you know we're	going	to see more and more of this kind of thing i think the jury trial system um	#telephone#	telephone_sw3765-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um that the well there was a guy who won in Pennsylvania uh this Senator Harris Wafford who said you know and and in this country everybody's entitled to a lawyer but not everybody's entitled to a doctor and we must spend i don't know what the figure is but jury trials are are just so expensive very very expensive and time consuming and uh so i think that that all of the these things that we're talking about are	going	to contribute to change and i don't know uh terribly expensive yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3765-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well i wish i could get my weight down i need to get out and get some exercise uh  as i say i've just retired so i'm just starting to have a few days to uh approach that subject and i'm considering it i'm	going	to get on that bicycle that we have and uh start doing some riding and i'm sure that's	#telephone#	telephone_sw3767-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah i have uh i was talking with some with with a friend of mine not too damned long ago and i'll tell you it it's you know i don't expect this would ever happen in the United States but i'm almost of the opinion that the only way that a change is	going	to come about is if uh we really put some teeth into the law and and make it such that uh the punishment fits the crime and uh um	#telephone#	telephone_sw3771-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and a lot of um i guess um discrimination is still around and i i suppose until somehow or another we can straighten out all of those things people are just	going	to take an extreme  uh measure and um uh protect themselves in one way or the other yeah i've i'm i'm a firm believer though that uh  our justice system has has no teeth any longer that the idea of getting a sentence	#telephone#	telephone_sw3771-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
but i guess i take a lot of  um little bit of um safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are like drug related or  um things that places usually that i wouldn't be	going	and things i usually wouldn't be involved in um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw3774-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah of it	going	on that it would really you know uh set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture well you may be right  what i think is really gonna be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it and i and i think it is what you say it's it's a	#telephone#	telephone_sw3805-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

they put a million dollars in it and it probably does a couple of hundred dollars worth of good right i i think they are	going	to be a lot more selective on on what they throw money at and there's some things some programs that just don't seem to be working at all	#telephone#	telephone_sw3881-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

um-hum uh there's no no need in spending all of this money on on a lot of welfare and these programs when you're	going	into debt to do it and i think that the government also goes overboard uh on the way they do things	#telephone#	telephone_sw3881-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

um i guess on a on a local level uh i i was thinking when i heard the question about major changes in the country today but it's probably a little easier now that i think about it if i look at what an individual could do and obviously if you have lights on and you have uh uh a timing system for your lights in your own home you're	going	to reduce the risk of being broken into right there's so many things that you can do in that way and you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw3885-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

because many times in the past they've you know they're happy to take our money and stuff but they often times fail to give us any support in return yeah well that was exactly who i i was thinking about whenever i made the comment of uh you know money	going	to people that seem less than appreciative i mean they're they're ready to take it and we set you know have have set uh a precedence over the history with them of always having an open pocket book uh and uh you know they've just have grown to expect it	#telephone#	telephone_sw3900-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right at least if we are	going	to be giving them all this money then at least  you know we should get some at least some cooperation or whatever in return yeah the one good thing about the Gulf War i i mean there was several good things about it but it was  one of the few things that we've ever done as a as a country that i think practically paid for itself	#telephone#	telephone_sw3900-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

by the same token most in in most cases women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who been there before but at lower lower salaries is is that right wrong yes i think that's generally speaking pretty true and i think that's what we really ought to look at that	going	is if they're gonna do equal work they ought to get equal pay is that	#telephone#	telephone_sw3908-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

i think so too and i think that uh that it was it was pretty much optional wasn't it at the time and and uh that's true and and the other thing too they're they were	going	to use both systems you know simultaneously yeah that's right see that's why i think it is i think they used both systems and everybody as long as they had inches  they could just transpose back and forth and it made it difficult so everybody thought well this is too much trouble	#telephone#	telephone_sw3910-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

to the best of my ability i'd like to do it until it gets impossible well i think that's also where you're gonna to have a lot of people who are	going	to it's there's not a choice it's because there it's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4108-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um it'll be like family around her that's right and i i've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of uh activities	going	on for the ones who are more active yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4108-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

but it seems hypocritical to me that we'd say in the case of murder for instance that uh because you took away somebody else's life and because that is so very wrong we are	going	to take away your life i don't see that that makes any sense really well it's not necessarily someone has the right but we do have the responsibility to punish criminals	#telephone#	telephone_sw4111-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
but i think life imprisonment is a much better alternative to uh people that perform crimes i think also people that are prone to commit a murder are not	going	to be deterred by the thought of being put to death i think that if they're uh the sort of mentality that they could do such a thing that it doesn't matter what threat you pose to them that that wouldn't change things as far as what they were capable of doing so i don't see it as much of a deterrent either	#telephone#	telephone_sw4111-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

the way they're running it now they're have you know running it under a deficit spending you know while we're not under a recession so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running so that's kind of a basic thing of economics i guess keep spending keep	going	into debt you're not	#telephone#	telephone_sw4138-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh uh i added up all the taxes that we were	going	to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4138-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes and so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point i'm not	going	to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4138-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so uh how you how do you find out what's	going	on what's new	#telephone#	telephone_sw4139-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
which is i know pretty much it's got in the morning it has like an all news format and then uh toward it it changes like it goes onto classical then onto jazz later on but on in the way to work that that's what i do is i listen to to NPR and what it says about about what's	going	on hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4139-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah that same here and that that pretty much gives you gives me an idea what's	going	on and in about like a two hours it takes me to run right through it i can figure out exactly what what what's happened in like the past week but that's about the only newspaper that i really listen to	#telephone#	telephone_sw4139-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well the thing with the police is that they're only good to pick up the pieces after the crime has happened we have to to take precautions to defend ourselves uh if someone comes after you with a gun there's no way that the police are	going	to stop them uh even if have an opportunity to call the police uh because someone has threatened you they won't come out and protect you all they can do is investigate a crime after it's been committed it's very rare that they prevent one	#telephone#	telephone_sw4140-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
what the electorate seems to be telling them the problem is of course is that the majority of the people in this country have no idea what the right to keep and bear arms means or what it's for and all they see is rampant crime in the streets and they think that banning guns is	going	to stop that but that's that's simply not the case uh you take away the guns uh from law-abiding people and uh i mean it it seems like a trite phrase but	#telephone#	telephone_sw4140-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you take away the guns uh from law-abiding people and uh i mean it it seems like a trite phrase but if if guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns they're not	going	to stop the drug dealers and the criminals from from getting uh guns of any sort and what they really need to do is attack the root causes of of crime that's true yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4140-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
they haven't been except for the immigrants have come to this country they're not cognizant of war and and chaos and terrorism like Lebanon or countries that have been invaded and if our country needs if our country's invaded we need the people to to rise i mean the the military and the police isn't	going	to do it all for us and if and if we don't have the the goverment	#telephone#	telephone_sw4140-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

um-hum and that's	going	really well uh because they i think what happened what what goes on is they get like discounts they get charged not by the amount of trash they do well they get charged by for the pick up of the trash and not for the recyclables	#telephone#	telephone_sw4143-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
gee i i didn't i i just thought there was something in the slick stuff that that made it so they couldn't recycle it well that's great yeah i i guess it depends on the facility it's	going	to the thing that i guess the flip side of that and in our town anyway is that they won't pick up plastics now and even when they were here and in other towns around here they won't take the so called injection molded things which	#telephone#	telephone_sw4143-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um and i don't know what's	going	on with in terms of capacity it's my impression although i haven't really read anything about it that so many towns and cities have started recycling with there might not be enough firms out there	#telephone#	telephone_sw4143-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

is like Monopoly money it it's so larger you don't really have a personal feeling for it if you go to by a new car you get a better feeling for for what's	going	on but even then it usually most of that is is finance through the bank and you not actually holding the money in your hands um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4222-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so is is that mixed all recyclables do you or is it only uh cans and bottles and stuff well right now and i was just	going	to go look for the little pamphlet i have about that uh but it's um bottles and cans and they've just added paper to it but what i'm not sure is whether or not you can put them all in the same bag i usually separate them	#telephone#	telephone_sw4223-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
hey um generally i am majority majority majority of the news that i get is from uh AM radio in the mornings but	going	to and from work i we have like uh a a WCBS station which which just kind of fires through all the top topics um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4224-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

if you believe that killing is wrong you you might as well apply that to you know even that stays stays true even if you're punishing someone i know that's how i feel yeah i mean it kind of seems	going	back to uh eye for an eye hand for a hand kind of thing maybe	#telephone#	telephone_sw4226-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
like i don't see Charles Manson i think he'll never get out he's he's probably	going	to be up for parole in a year or so but he's not	#telephone#	telephone_sw4226-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

um where as it sounds like A&M does it more or does it also on an undergraduate level yes and they uh several of the other universities were using them as a model and	going	to try it because they felt that so	#telephone#	telephone_sw4229-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum now of course that's what i i marvel at some of these youngsters that i see talk about	going	off to college that have no self-discipline that yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4229-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
exactly because no matter where you go you there isn't	going	to be uh mommy to get you up or anything else you know yeah that's that's another thing i wanted to emphasize is that	#telephone#	telephone_sw4229-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and more about myself um being able to handle the situations that i came into i would think that would be true you would also you know be totally on your own where you if you need help you're	going	to be the one to search it out right um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4229-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right um-hum it isn't gonna just be sitting there and life is something that you have to search out everything you're	going	to do exactly it's it's an active state it's not something that you can kind of you know be passively involved in and expect to do	#telephone#	telephone_sw4229-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
aquarium first and i got to where i wanted uh take my fish out and hold them and pet them  that wasn't	going	to work so i had to get something that i could hold and pet yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4231-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

right and look out so she can know what's	going	on and i had all these delusions about how my dog was not	#telephone#	telephone_sw4231-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

it's not the kind of thing that would be really talent you know it's not something that's questionable like political opinions it's sort of a state of technology and what are we	going	to do with this and what do you suppose would happen if the government got ahold of it and you know that kind of thing oh okay	#telephone#	telephone_sw4232-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
but yeah Doonesbury is great i mean sometimes he that doesn't even try to be funny he just puts stuff in that strip that we're not	going	to see anywhere else and uh uh like when he was quoting an entire week from Bush's speeches and the guy was completely incoherent	#telephone#	telephone_sw4232-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum if you assume they're biased and then look for some opposite biases you get a fairly good idea of what's	going	on i know and it's like especially like if with the network news they always comment about everything and their comments are always biased	#telephone#	telephone_sw4232-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um campaign things that have been	going	on um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4232-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and they have to be conservative because they have this multimillion dollar investment to protect and they're beholding to their advertisers they have to be conservative but the writers a reporter i mean if you're	going	to be in the business of reporting if you're a journalist uh you get cynical and uh cynicism can sometimes be confused with liberalism	#telephone#	telephone_sw4232-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
about three dollars and um twenty cents or so or something like that i i was about half asleep when they were talking about it on the news but um it is not	going	to go over too well as long as you have to pay a premium to participate i don't believe yeah unless they structure the garbage rates so that uh you know it like works out to be cheaper	#telephone#	telephone_sw4233-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and yeah and then uh the other thing is what do they do with all the stuff they're just they're	going	to recycle they now have this huge glut of paper um and it's difficult to find markets for it so the as a result the um price of	#telephone#	telephone_sw4233-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
he is he's very good he was i think he's i read in the paper i was thinking about	going	down to the Jazz festival in New Orleans it's like a i think might be the end of April but um	#telephone#	telephone_sw4234-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and i've we've got extra room in our house and i've been driving all my roommates crazy playing on that but i really need to get like i know this guy that i think i'm	going	to try to get to uh give me lessons and stuff because there's lots of stuff that i don't i mean i could i'm improving but slowly and i think i could you know yeah well also if you if you take lessons you might be able to uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4234-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so i'm not sure how remarkably well informed i am by their like three second sound bytes about everything but uh i'm a college student at this point and uh when i come in when i turn that on for half an hour i see what's	going	on and then i turn it off and so how do you get your news	#telephone#	telephone_sw4235-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
that's right so they're	going	to tell you what sells and also although i don't believe this is really that rampant at now uh you know sponsors or or advertisers could have some influence as well over over what uh eventually gets printed i uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4235-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well i think that's uh it's kind of related to like who writes history because obviously the the news eventually does become history it's just always	going	to be someone's the prevailing opinion yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4235-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh but i'm very you know i you know i've gotten it's i i it's funny how you get older and you don't know what's	going	on in popular music at all like who are some of the heavy metal um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4236-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
gosh how should i say this you're	going	for the average the average kid is	#telephone#	telephone_sw4237-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so do you plan on on uh keeping her in day care until she goes to school i think uh well i think we're	going	to keep her where she's at now until she's about uh three and a half or four and then move her into a regular day care that has uh more children	#telephone#	telephone_sw4237-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah well how how do you manage control uh or limit your spending or or you know do you uh in our in our case it's more of a a philosophy like you know for the next few months we're really	going	to watch it and we'll try try to control the big things well	#telephone#	telephone_sw4238-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah yeah we've actually got uh see there's several different bins at the work place and at home we've got several different recycling things	going	on and um uh at home	#telephone#	telephone_sw4239-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and then uh at work this actually kind of a funny story uh for a long time the the guys who ran the company i work for we're kind of resistant to uh any kind of recycling because they felt like it was just	going	to cost them money or something yeah that's kind of reasonable	#telephone#	telephone_sw4239-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yep and uh the other ones uh they have for aluminum cans they also have and this is sort of the funniest part they had a styrofoam recycling thing	going	on i understand	#telephone#	telephone_sw4239-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah so anyway so we we have a lot of things lot of things	going	on i actually i'm i'm a big uh i'm a big recycling fan i think it's pretty important actually hear about all these stories about uh plastics and stuff showing up out in the ocean you know choking animals and stuff like that it's pretty pretty gory	#telephone#	telephone_sw4239-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you know it's well it's actually can go both ways something some ways you have more opportunities because there're so many things	going	on within the company but you also may get key holed and you are a ex type person therefore you should only work on this type project	#telephone#	telephone_sw4240-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
we're recycling uh all the cans the glass bottles all the plastic and the newspapers which that's great i really feel like uh community sponsorship is	going	to be one of the keys to uh recycling success um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4241-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and he doesn't want to feel that he's uh he's	going	to be completely responsible for this only because he happens to live right there with with my in-laws have you guys thought about the financial burden	#telephone#	telephone_sw4244-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i i guess thirty years ago when when you were that age and you weren't able to really care for yourself you really weren't	going	to uh you know be around that much longer and so the level of care required was was different but now people are are living longer and can uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4244-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
usually doesn't yeah well she's	going	to school there right now so  you know she was headed back there so certainly wouldn't make an extra trip for fifty dollars for a hundred miles but	#telephone#	telephone_sw4245-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah space exploration i think is not uh those developments we make in order to accomplish it but those things that we discover that we have no idea we're	going	to discover it's it's all the surprises the problem with that is you can't sure	#telephone#	telephone_sw4246-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah it's it preach that as as a political statement you know in front of congress saying we should fund it because we don't know what we're	going	to discover yeah that's kind of that's kind of hard to defend in some ways but	#telephone#	telephone_sw4246-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh those are the best kind so it's	going	to be a monster yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4247-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah yeah that's	going	to change at some point you know  a couple of years ago nobody around here talked about it and then one day everybody just kind of woke up and said gee you know we're we're in trouble and we got to fix this problem um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4249-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

and besides that i don't think i think the NRA's got such a big lobby that i don't think  they'd be able to yeah clearly they have some other motive you know i mean their their argument used to be you know the communist were	going	to take over or something well they aren't anymore you know so what's the argument now well yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4252-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah just so that they'll they can understand all the pain that they're	going	through and you know then they wouldn't be saying well that killer has a life too because it's not true the as soon as the killer kills someone they they should deserve to die their life is over too i mean they took someone else's life so i don't i just don't think they should deserve to live i think  everybody who's ever murdered	#telephone#	telephone_sw4253-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
what that means is that the politicians rather than try and clean up this that nest of uh problems they'll they'll come out to uh to uh people and they'll say what you you have to uh we're	going	to enact stricter laws on the rest of you yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4253-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

yeah that's true and there's there's not really that much of what's	going	on and the only stories that really get talked about are the ones that have good video clips to go with them um-hum yeah and it's been a long time since i've seen any  you know source of the media do anything gutsy	#telephone#	telephone_sw4259-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and that's i guess uh something that distresses me when they have to cater to all these different special interest groups we're not	going	to get the news well that's one nice nice thing about the public radio and public television is for the most part they're some what distanced from that but	#telephone#	telephone_sw4259-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

there there there needs to be lots of evidence for appealing um i have a friend who uh took his trial by judge and that's the worst mistake anyone can ever make because at least with the jury even though you're	going	to be tried by six or twelve people who weren't able to get out of jury duty that's an old joke but it's still true a lot of the people who you would want to have on your jury don't want to have anything to do with it	#telephone#	telephone_sw4294-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
but still i take my chance with the odds of twelve and we have to sacrifice letting a few people get away with things because eventually they're	going	to be caught then for my personal risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time	#telephone#	telephone_sw4294-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
not at this point in the business cycle you can't yeah i think that the people that um orchestrated this and engineered our having the deficit should have appreciated you know what it was ultimately	going	to cost it was a very bad decision to start letting that grow yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4295-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

kind of what kind of overused in a sense it's the idea is that you can have a two income family and nothing is	going	to be changed you know the idea of quality time over over quantity of time spent with kids which i think is nonsense	#telephone#	telephone_sw4304-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

i never really thought that that the the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little i i always that the the real question was is are we getting a reasonable return on on investment for instance like Social Security tax or Social uh i mean that's that's tax we're paying money and and supposedly this money is	going	into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us hm right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4333-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

you start way back when yeah generally you know a kid'll do something that's outrageous and they'll say well what are you	going	to do to me and it's almost like the criminal system there's not much i can do to them i can't really do anything to them one fellow said i said how about you do your work and he said well how about i throw these scissors at you	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right and and i think that's the the biggest thing that unless people know that you're serious and you're not gonna tolerate that kind of behavior in anybody i this is just gonna keep	going	um-hum well i think that's like the problem with you know drunk drivers that people don't they're not cracking down they let them back out on the street they don't really take away their license they don't really make sure they can't drive anymore	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

okay well um i've never i've didn't really ever have to have a budget um until i quit	going	to Georgia Tech and um then i learned to budget really fast  um i had been working part-time before that and uh my parents were helping me some but um	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i had been working part-time before that and uh my parents were helping me some but um i got to where i mean i knew where every penny was	going	but then as i started making more money um my budget's kind of hasn't doesn't exist except for at certain times  you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i still haven't managed to uh uh do it the way i should yeah but even even if you do break your budget i think when you write things down or however if if you do it on the computer whatever or something where you can just constantly see exactly what where your money's	going	right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
but but even if you can't i don't think have enough a really when before when i had a strict budget it's because i had too i knew exactly where every penny was	going	before i had it but it's it's a little bit harder when you have a little bit more leeway	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right but you'll find that the  kids don't really have a very good sense of where the money is	going	and so they'll ask for things pretty much constantly right i remember doing that as a child	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
but uh i don't know whether i believe that they should just randomly do it i think they should kind of warn them like you know well we're	going	to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired you know that this is what's gonna happen	#telephone#	telephone_sw4605-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah i think so i think they all should test really you know uh it just seems like there is so much more of it	going	on anymore yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4605-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
that's amazing slip in slip out you know they know exactly what they're	going	for so i've heard that's really on the rise as far as um you know a new type of crime yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4608-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah and i think the same thing is true with news if you want to just have an idea as to what's	going	on most papers and and especially the better papers the the Times the Wall Street Journal the Washington Post give you a reasonable idea uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4611-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and i sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine and when i arrived at her house she was engrossed in that we ended up watching it for a couple of hours zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and eating watching it some more and i thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was	going	on but even then i didn't end up doing it on my own um	#telephone#	telephone_sw4611-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

well i i feel the other thing too uh they were saying uh you know what new ways could you could it you you know change the system i i really think that um we spend a lot of time uh	going	through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal i mean if if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime there's uh no question it's beyond a reasonable doubt	#telephone#	telephone_sw4830-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
see when when when you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times uh you know the benefits are good and and you know the pay's regular but uh well you know sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's	going	on and i i i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that uh anybody could get in uh in dealing in a with a large company is to be in a situation where you you get to know what's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4831-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

i mean i feel like if i i don't necessarily need to uh be involved since i'm pretty much on a low level you are you are right there you know i'm pretty much on a low level as far as uh uh the company is concerned but i i do kind of like to know what's	going	on and what's happening and i think i can be a better and more effective employee if if i had a little bit more information along that line well that i	#telephone#	telephone_sw4831-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

uh i guess it's not totally not understandable  you know i'm i'm sure that if you're looking at whether or not you're	going	to get elected and have enough money to run that they've got to uh got to take that into consideration oh sure but i think it goes i you know a little of it obviously is they're getting themselves prepared for when they're out of office when they become consultants or high-powered lobbyists themselves	#telephone#	telephone_sw4895-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
it's uh well it it's it's such a complicated thing let me just relate to you uh an experience that i had with politics at a lower level uh and i think what it boils down to is that if you can't find compromise you're not	going	to be successful um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4895-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so i guess if we were to go about making the change you would have to really demonstrate to people that there is some legitimate reason to make the change that would directly benefit them otherwise we're never	going	to really see any change yeah well	#telephone#	telephone_sw4899-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah i'm just	going	to walk over here and stop my cats from doing what they're doing um and the metric system is you know hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4899-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah that's true who i don't think are	going	to especially you know they may do it in the more in the big city centers or in certain round uh manufacturing industries but the average person in Raleigh Missouri i don't think is	#telephone#	telephone_sw4899-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
who i don't think are	going	to especially you know they may do it in the more in the big city centers or in certain round uh manufacturing industries but the average person in Raleigh Missouri i don't think is	#telephone#	telephone_sw4899-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i don't know it just seems to me that everybody wants to know if they do something what's	going	to happen to them um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4901-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum i substitute teach and i have kids who talk fresh don't do homework and they say so what's	going	to happen to me and and people getting less and less respect and they understand they know that the bottom line is not very much is	#telephone#	telephone_sw4901-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

are always willing to um let in cheap labor  if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area those are two  things that i think are	going	on although they i i i don't think the politicians would tell you that okay and i think you're right in both cases	#telephone#	telephone_sw4902-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum and uh i think it's too early to say you know whether they're	going	to develop some stable societies there in one form or another um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4903-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
or whether this uh  old uh Russian tendency to turn their fate over to some insane ruler is	going	to surface again sure yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4903-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um it's	going	to take both democracy and economic progress and uh resolution of their nationalist institutes i guess right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4903-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right all of that is	going	to have to happen and if any one of them turn sour they could still be uh dangerous simply because they might not you know they just might sort of lose track of what they're doing	#telephone#	telephone_sw4903-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
it looks like um we're	going	to have um a um sort of a third party movement on our hands in the fall	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah i  that's a pretty good point i hadn't thought about it like that but yeah it's i guess it's not really um a start up with uh necessarily new ideas and you know this is my positive outlook but rather uh saying well uh i'm just not very happy with uh with the other two parties seem to be	going	type of thing yeah i think there's absolutely no political philosophy the only thing that uh Perot um seems to has to offer is that uh he's a doer	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah and since most people agree on what needs to be done but nobody can figure out how to do it he's just	going	to say uh i'm a CEO i know how to tell people to do things and get them done	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um in each party and not really coming up with a new ideas or the or maybe i mean it it you know it's time for maybe a definite new vision and and what's	going	on which may be you know a blend of both you know maybe both parties or you know a little bit of this a little bit of that which may not fall into the lines of either party but you know just doesn't seem as though either party wants to do very much that rocks the boat or maybe maybe says oh its time for a little bit of you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah things aren't	going	very well oh in the big picture maybe right now Congress getting better or it's maybe it's getting worse or who knows but you know it's just like a little ripple in the ocean it's  know some some somebody got to look down the road a ways and say well what's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i i think it has to be up front and then you've got the choice of not doing it yeah well well the problem there is that you know a lot of people that have worked for the same company for so long um that company decides well if we're	going	to hire new people you know well we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw4911-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah well well the problem there is that you know a lot of people that have worked for the same company for so long um that company decides well if we're	going	to hire new people you know well we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw4911-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um and uh then they have the choice of either take the test or don't get the or or don't take the job and if they know they're	going	to fail the test you know they're kind of in a in a between a rock and a hard place there so it's uh kind of like	#telephone#	telephone_sw4911-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you know a little crazy but he wouldn't you know give a urine sample and it was pretty obvious why you know he's just like oh i can't do it i can't do it you know  and this went on for hours i was wondering why he didn't just leave you know if you're not	going	to do it just leave he was gonna fail	#telephone#	telephone_sw4911-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yep yep and then here's what we have now i mean what's in five years from now it's just unimaginable what we're	going	to be able to do with these things yeah yeah well you know if we ever get any sort of uh ISDN running nationally it'll be really incredible	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah uh so you know it's	going	to kind of impact everybody everywhere well i see the phone companies are working on getting into information services so we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh so you know it's	going	to kind of impact everybody everywhere well i see the phone companies are working on getting into information services so we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum oh yeah and i think that the technology's catching up to the point where we're	going	to be able to do things and make it a lot easier to for people to understand how to do these things um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so i'm hoping that we will see another type of revolution but one that will be a little more friendly to the end user yeah yeah um i think what's	going	to happen is it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum but i think everyone's working now i i mean i'm seeing this we're	going	to see a lot more in the way of keyboards with electronic program guides and and everything else and ordering systems they have this thing called TV um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
an interesting topic yes the uh type of cars that i was uh uh i would probably be most interested in if i was	going	to buy another car now would probably be something like a uh Mazda Miata uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4917-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

hm um a mass turnout of the current people that we have in there or whether this is just	going	to be another of the same old well throw the bums out but not my bum you know right right as long as he brings pork back  my state then um what what do you think his	#telephone#	telephone_sw4926-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right right as long as he brings pork back  my state then um what what do you think his chances are what do you think uh how much of the vote do you think he's	going	to get and do you think he will take it more from the Republicans or the Democrats well the media media keeps saying that he's supposed to drain it away from the Democrats but i know that there's a lot of Democrats that don't like Bill Clinton	#telephone#	telephone_sw4926-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
i you know i'm concerned more concerned about Democrats saying they're unhappy with Bill Clinton and then they go and vote for Ross Perot and then we basically split any protest vote against against Bush more or less in half you know i mean you're dividing it too far and then he squeaks by for four more years and you know for me that's not a	going	to be a wonderful uh feeling exactly	#telephone#	telephone_sw4926-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and uh and you know i kind of think it's uh it's a lot of work but i think it's uh it's the uh you know the the amount of effort that's required to uh to stay healthy you know i have a sedentary job and uh unless you do something like that you know you're	going	to get sick right yeah i'm i need to get i'm i'm i'm pretty bad about that i'm lazy i should i know i want i always say that i need to get running start running and i	#telephone#	telephone_sw4928-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
