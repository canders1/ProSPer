So we uh, through tremendous diversionary tactics of dragging my leg and my elbow and so forth we managed to stop just at the, the edge of the road after blistering my elbow on a big knot of ice but uh, I don't think Marsha knew about that until a few years ago I guess I don't know it's been a while but uh, yeah the snow there in the winters were exciting to say the least. [SEP] I remember many mornings	walking	down to the bus where you know whatever you had in your nose would freeze. [SEP] It would just crunch and you went to blow your nose nothing liquid came out it was crystals and you'd get on the school bus and it would be so damn cold that the floor of the bus would just be a solid sheet of ice you'd have rock salt scattered on the floor of the bus in order to keep some kind of traction and uh, had a couple of deviant children there on the bus and one's name was Robbie Share.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And on this particular night, it was night, they, they had a bull out there that was pretty mean and would charge the fence at people. [SEP] And um, Grandma, my grandmother, their mother, was	walking	with them that night. [SEP] She was going to watch TV.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BranchElbert.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And uh, it was dark, they really couldn't see. [SEP] And uh, they were	walking	up the path and Grandma accidentally stepped in something that was really soft and her foot got to sinking and instead of her pulling that one foot back out and shaking it off to keep going, she stuck both feet in there and she started to holler.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BranchElbert.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
mom would always sit us around at home at the evenings, um, and tell us about her days growing up. [SEP] They	walking	to school in the rain, sleet, and snow, five miles and all this other crazy stuff-- Uphill both ways.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BranchElbert.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
We call this our home because this is where we were raised at. [SEP] But uh, we hear a lot about home and how it used to be and like I said	walking	five miles to school and-- So don't complain Elbert.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BranchElbert.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I didn't know how to go around and try and find. [SEP] So I just pulled the van over and at the plant parking lot and I got out and started	walking	and I was just, I can remember live wires being everywhere, crackling and popping. [SEP] And the first thing I saw when I got home, was my neighbor over here, two houses over.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
He was outside, he was, it was really funny. [SEP] He was out and here I come	walking	up and looking like something the cat drug in. [SEP] And he's like, "Debbie, Have you seen my shutters?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
You know? [SEP] It's like a loaf of bread that you can chew on while you're	walking	down the street. [SEP] Yeah.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
But it's just wonderful! [SEP] There's, there's so many things that you never get the chance to see anywhere else, but you can see it all just	walking	around. [SEP] And then, of course, you have Lombard St, the crookedest street in the world.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Absolutely the crookedest street in the world, yeah. [SEP] And all those are right there within	walking	distance. [SEP] Then you take a cable car and go to Chinatown.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Uh-huh. [SEP] And still that's not that far, but after	walking	up and down those hills! [SEP] You are ready for bed when you go to bed that night!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And uh, you know, I mean we were trying to be quiet not to wake her parents up so you know and uh, we ended up watching this movie and this movie ends up lasting until about um, 4:30, 5:00 in the morning. [SEP] And uh, she's, her dad works uh, construction so uh, she told us we had to leave because her dad gets up real early in the morning so uh, we hurry up and get out of the house and uh, we're	walking	on the way home and uh, we're seeing the uh, newspaper car running around throwing newspapers out. [SEP] And uh, I don't know who thought of it I don't know if it was me or	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And uh, one of us thought of the idea of sticking a newspaper in the mailbox and setting the mailbox and newspaper on fire. [SEP] So uh, one of us we were	walking	down the road picked up uh, a newspaper wadded it up and stuck it in the mailbox and uh, this was uh, metal mailbox with uh, brick around it. [SEP] And we stuck it in there and we lit it and it shot into a big old flame, you know lit up the whole sky.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And we stuck it in there and we lit it and it shot into a big old flame, you know lit up the whole sky. [SEP] And I mean we were just, you know it got us real fired up you know and so uh, we were	walking	along a little further and we saw another newspaper and uh, we stuck it in the mailbox and it was another metal mailbox. [SEP] So uh, we were like "Cool!"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And, and, she said, uh my Granny said she got up and she, she looked up and she said, "You know, wonder who that could be?" [SEP] And so she sat back down, and, you know, they were still chatting, and they could still see this person, and this person was	walking	really, really fast. [SEP] And she said that her brother had this really distinctive walk and she said the more she looked at that person coming down that road she started thinking "No, that can't be, that can't be."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
but she said, "It can't be." [SEP] So Granny got up, and she kind of walked down the steps off the porch and she was	walking	up towards the road and she then just stood there. [SEP] And then he was coming, she said he was coming really fast--she said could still remember all that dust kicking up on the road--and here he's coming down the road, and she turns around and she said, "It's Joe!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I don't know if you remembered it or not or ever thought about it. [SEP] Well, we got the pictures of that and, and even got the pictures of a Russian officer	walking	on the gangplank. [SEP] Why this was the next day.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I say, "OK, everybody, we're going to get out of the truck, we're going to kind of look around, we'll do some stuff, and then, we'll probably eat breakfast, and then we'll go or, ea, we had our little bag lunches, and then we'll go down to the lake. And, uh, we get out of the truck, and we walk about ten feet, and I, I was like,	walking	over logs and trying to get over to a fairly clear area, and all of a sudden, Alex just goes, "Snake! [SEP] Snake!"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And I, I'm like, God, somebody's trying to tell me something. [SEP] So anyway, we kind of, we stayed away from the snake and we're kind of	walking	around, and then, Jack and Nick, they, Jack's the oldest, and Nick, you know, is eight, and, uh, they want to go down to the lake, and Elizabeth's going, "No, don't let them go down to the lake, just, it's too steep, don't let them go down to the lake." [SEP] And, uh,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
You guys can go, go down to the lake, just be careful. [SEP] " And, uh, so they kind of walked over to the hill, kind of started	walking	down, and at a point they just had to sit on their butts and kind of slide down, and the trees were all cut, so they'd grab trees as they were going down. [SEP] And, um, I was just watching them, and I was up at the top, and then, I started down, I'd figured, let them go first, then I'd, I'd go kind of behind them.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It was totally safe; you never locked your doors. [SEP] We cut through the woods	walking	to school. [SEP] Um, and then when I got in junior high, we started riding city buses to school.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It made a huge impression on me and was a big thing. [SEP] Columbus, GA is the home of Fort Benning, GA, where the largest infantry school in the world at that time was there, and as a kid	walking	to school, and believe it or not, I did walk four or five miles to school and I would go up Brown Avenue, which was at that time the only road that would allow the convoys to come through. [SEP] And I would walk along the road to school and convoys of young men would, uh, ride by in the backs of trucks and I would wave at them and it was not a sexual thing in those days.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
, every beach has a character. [SEP] And, um, as I was	walking	along the beach, there were broken sand dollars. [SEP] I mean, it was just an incredible number of broken pieces of sand dollars.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
This little ribbon of water. [SEP] So we climbed up part way down and it was like	walking	in, uh, in a, in a great big pile of ball bearings, you know? [SEP] It was like really loose.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
Her name was Crystal. [SEP] And so, um, we met in FL, and in Boca Raton and we stayed with my grandparents, and we would stay with my grandparents for at least one night, uh Boca Raton, and then the rest of the week we spent in Fort Lauderdale because my grandfather owned a hotel called The Sanddollar in a place called Lauderdale by the Sea, um, in Fort Lauderdale, and it was fantastic time and when we had the chance to spend time together and just go out on the beach and at night we would go out to dinner I remember going to a Benihana Japanese steakhouse, and we just felt like we had freedom, and then we weren't yet 21 so we weren't allowed to go to clubs in Fort Lauderdale, so we basically spent our time, uh, watching movies in the hotel room or just	walking	along the strip and I remember going out for ice cream one night and just	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
That's a lot of children to feed when you don't have a lot of money. [SEP] So, her father had to walk her down the street, she can remember holding his hand and	walking	down this dirt road with a little suitcase, and in it was everything that she owned. [SEP] And he took her to a neighbor's and she became their foster child.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

The BHB is the Butt Hole Bandit and you know what I'm saying, it all started from the time where, you know what I'm saying. [SEP] And we'd be	walking	home from school and we'd see some man. [SEP] I, I guess, you know what I'm saying, somebody wore a black hat just looked creepy that you'd never seen before.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So we were just like, "There goes the man with black hat." [SEP] Then come to find out that during that same summer, this guy that played on our football team had, supposedly was	walking	through the park, Briarwood Park on, um, Plaza. [SEP] The same, uh, elementary school that we went to.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
The same, uh, elementary school that we went to. [SEP] He was	walking	home from the basketball court and he supposedly got raped by this dude.

Watch out the for the BHB, the Butt Hole Bandit. [SEP] " So any time we saw people	walking	down the street that look didn't look familiar, `cause we had a pretty close knit community, so we had people	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
And I remember one time, we were picking on this dude who wanted to fight, you know what I'm saying, we thought we were the stuff `cause nobody could catch us on our bikes. [SEP] This dude was	walking	through our neighborhood and we started calling him the Butt Hole Bandit and whatnot and he started chasing us and he was saying he was the Butt Hole Bandit- -but he probably just saying it,-	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
It's been a good couple of years for us Yankee fans here lately. [SEP] And, uh, we were down on Fifty-Third Street, which is five blocks away from Central Park, and, um, my fianc�e had just passed her boards and it was our anniversary, so I decided to surprise her with	walking	down to Central Park off of Fifty-Eighth.

And there weren't any really, except headless farmers that would come out at midnight on certain days of the year and throw potatoes at you! [SEP] If you were	walking	the road at night.

Well, to back up, when I was just learning to walk, your grandmother and grandfather told me that when we'd go down to the beach and spend the summer at the beach, back then there was no air conditioning whatsoever, and so all the, the bars and the stores and everything on the boardwalks would have screened-in, screened doors on the front. [SEP] And any place we'd go by when I was	walking	with them, I'd have my hands up in the air and they'd be holding either hand-- --and when we'd go by any place that had a juke box playing, I had to stop and jog up and down in time to the music.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
exactly exactly right yeah we we have i think we we name drop it a little too much and and don't fully understand what what what it is we're saying i think it's it's focusing in on the issue and	walking	your talk and and all that kind of rolls in together there but uh yeah yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2024-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever i think maybe	walking	or running would probably work because you it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2776-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
huh where they're trying to have restaurants within	walking	distance but at the same time in other words you go down in a subway or whatever uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2781-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

um-hum um i you know i found that it's not necessary really necessary to knock yourself out to that degree to keep fit and i really think	walking	is probably one of the best things because it's something if you live into your nineties you could continue to do i think so to well and i i was very pleased uh when uh during cold weather and i haven't lived in Charlotte North Carolina a full year yet but uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2843-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

and um so that's that's what i try and uh do well the only things that we can do as citizens is you know like those uh watch groups that they'll have	walking	but they can be dangerous too and i've thought about it you know uh um-hum um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2844-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
really uh-huh this isn't like	walking	around and looking for somebody you can get yourself into trouble yeah yeah you know i was uh going home the other day and i saw um a guy who who looked like he was breaking into a window and i thought gee whiz you know i don't know if he's really doing that or not or if he's the he's the person who lives there	#telephone#	telephone_sw2844-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

well paved park and beautiful uh uh bathrooms within	walking	distance and you rent a site and they rent a tent that's and you put your tent well one tent's already up um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw3594-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and you work out at home then yeah basically i have i have a stationary bike at home have some weights at home that i use and then you know i try to supplement it periodically with you know some	walking	what have you uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3617-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
no he's looking to leave from what i hear oh if he leaves then they're they're done with they won't go anywhere this year i mean that's their two biggest guys that are	walking	so yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3687-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum well i understand that i've been trying to get myself motivated i had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor uh she had injured her back and needed a	walking	partner and i thought that'd be the time to get going um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw3723-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um and i just don't like	walking	by myself at night or in the dark of the morning and i don't seem to find time in the day time and of course it's motivation that's keeping me from really looking for that opportunity yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3723-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah and i understand that	walking	is suppose to be like the best exercise better than running things like that because it it works everything and it gets your breathing up and it it doesn't yeah yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3723-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you know it was there was points you could you you would make and you know there was a point to it but running and jogging and just not going anywhere it's just because i don't i just can't understand that so i don't do it yeah well i've got a dog now and and of course she needs	walking	and so that's a little less try you know uh burdensome or boring to be	#telephone#	telephone_sw3723-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
hum yeah i know a lot of people just to be safe like you were talking about	walking	at night and in the morning early in the morning um you see a lot of uh mostly older people though but that uh walk in the malls yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3723-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
that's kind of an idea uh we we have uh over here in Plano a little recreation center that's got a	walking	track that is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it anytime of the year oh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3723-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh congratulations thank you my exercise basically has been what	walking	that i can get in yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3767-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
huh and it it i know that	walking	is good for you and uh i keep reading that it's much better for you than running because of the uh actions of the joints and so forth yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3767-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and no it's up until now its been mostly by myself because i would have been downtown and as i say	walking	around on campus picking up mail and and doing things like that and running running downtown uh during my lunch period	#telephone#	telephone_sw3767-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah well it gives me an opportunity to get some	walking	in and yeah i was gonna say you probably get a lot of	#telephone#	telephone_sw3767-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well it gives me an opportunity to get some	walking	in and yeah i was gonna say you probably get a lot of	#telephone#	telephone_sw3767-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
do you we have a bicycle in the house uh the kind that you pump you know that you can change the loading and she rides that and that seems to be uh probably other than	walking	that's probably one of the better things you can do uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3767-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you know a a fellow i work with uh in Houston he told me uh just this past week his wife was	walking	out of a mall ten o'clock in the morning in Houston and was robbed oh my in the parking lot oh yes uh-huh um	#telephone#	telephone_sw3771-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum and lots of businesses within	walking	distance but uh um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw3775-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah that's good when we first adopted her we she she wasn't	walking	yet but she was soon	#telephone#	telephone_sw3806-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so it was just that their muscles weren't as well toned as they started or i i'm not sure if it was tone or exactly what it was but i i remember they had a lot of problems with their uh when when they got back to Earth uh	walking	you know they walk they couldn't walk very well uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3816-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah so anyway i could get a little bit of exercise that way um yeah the winter of course even here in uh in northern Texas we do get a little cold weather but most of the winter i can go	walking	just about anytime i want to uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3827-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and uh she moved in it was only about it's	walking	distance to where she lived  so she retained all her old friends and uh they they look after her and they serve pretty good meals yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3860-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
the dog had hopped out at the service station to go to the bathroom and uh we didn't know it until we got home and i mean you talk about somebody being frantic and upset and and it took us three days of	walking	that little town and talking to everybody and handing out posters and pictures with pictures of the dog oh my word	#telephone#	telephone_sw3865-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh i think the one that really excited the kids our kids were quite young and that's when this moose great big antlers come	walking	right through our campground we had a fire going and and uh it just kind of sauntered through and went over to a stream and was eating and didn't didn't mind you being there a bit huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3895-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum and and do much in the way of either you like say fast	walking	or uh running i work downtown and it not as convenient to get out at lunchtime downtown Dallas although there there is a Y very close i guess i could do that	#telephone#	telephone_sw3896-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and it was about six thirty when i left the uh store and i was	walking	back to my car and boy i tell you i got spooked	#telephone#	telephone_sw3920-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
right and uh there's	walking	trails on both sides a	#telephone#	telephone_sw3936-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well that's good i mean at least you've given some time to it every day it's not as if you're not doing anything it's  some some a little something yes but uh i really enjoy	walking	and somehow i'll do it for a while maybe a month or two months and you know walk two miles a day or something and then and then quit i	#telephone#	telephone_sw3958-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and if i try to wait till the end of the day when i think i have a little bit more time i don't always have the energy level yeah that's hard isn't it  uh that that four to six o'clock i see a lot of people out	walking	and i just think oh i'm just going to go and you know just sit yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3958-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah that it is and it is hard to do i mean it is easier to do at home even the	walking	which i can do right here the idea of getting of getting in a car to drive to a a place which a number of my friends keep suggesting	#telephone#	telephone_sw3958-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh so you've thought about that as well a bike exercise i've thought i've thought about doing that uh this tape is nice	walking	as i say is one that i really like i'm concerned about flexibility i'm i'm almost fifty and and i can you know begin to feel a little of that um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw3958-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh yeah i agree stuff like that when you have your door closed people just	walking	in and stuff like that um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw3968-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah you're like i i really didn't want to do it i was just kidding you know i just  thought i'd come try it out yeah  yeah i happened to be	walking	down the hall turned into some some other instructor's office and said help me  and he sold me on his program yeah really	#telephone#	telephone_sw3990-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah i know i've i've come to the conclusion also that you know just if you are	walking	in a downtown area you know where where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's gonna just just keeping your senses about you and you know trying not to look like a victim you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw4023-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
of doing that either no  no i i i i just get a sense of our	walking	in over and over and over again in places where we weren't well versed or something right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4030-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yes now this one has been quite mild um we could have been out	walking	throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground it was quite chilly but not	#telephone#	telephone_sw4032-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and uh	walking	is repeatable and bicycling is repeatable i i bicycle once in a while yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4053-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and it takes me a while to get back into it so well so do you do you enjoy your	walking	or is it just because you have to exercise you know you need to exercise well there're two kinds one kind is where you just get out and you do it because you've got to do it and the other kind is	#telephone#	telephone_sw4053-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah is uh actually most of the	walking	i've been doing these days is is just a bunch that i'm with uh uh a couple of people in my group who we just	#telephone#	telephone_sw4053-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah and an innocent bystander and when looking back he had forty two convictions and yet he was still	walking	loose so we've got problem here with the alcohol especially that uh uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4054-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh-huh but they don't have any problem	walking	right by you if you're asleep oh my word	#telephone#	telephone_sw4055-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah i mean like the right now i'm in uh our student center studying and i'll go out of my i'll walk up get up from my table and walk out of my way i mean well they're right near the trash can so i'll i'll toss it in the bin but um as far as if i'm	walking	in the street drinking a soda and i finish it i'm going to toss it in the nearest trash can probably i mean it's convenient it's it's there if the the recycling bin is not there i'm probably i'm if it was there i'd use it	#telephone#	telephone_sw4107-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah so i've just gotten up to um being able to jog one and a half to two miles and then um about mile and a half of	walking	yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4126-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so well i do a lot of	walking	at work because i'm outside a lot so oh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4126-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh okay so i'm outside a lot i work on airplanes so i do a lot of	walking	there yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4126-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you can um i don't know do a lot of	walking	like you are and do calisthenics or something i don't know	#telephone#	telephone_sw4126-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum they repeat the main headlines every half-hour so i would listen to two segments of that and you know really really know stuff and now that i'm just	walking	and riding the bus um wow	#telephone#	telephone_sw4136-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah uh i mean as you're	walking	through that little tour in uh Munich it's kind of  they're trying to brainwash you too oh of course of course they are they want you to buy their car yeah there it was it was interesting i was at i i also went to uh the Porsche and uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed	#telephone#	telephone_sw4137-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh my goodness and i went out there the next mourning to feed her and i put her food in there and i walked out the gate and pretty soon i heard the gate slick open and she comes	walking	out behind me i was like um	#telephone#	telephone_sw4219-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
it's it's a lot better then nothing i think oh yeah i've just recently um something i tried to incorporate into life style just recently is	walking	when i'm going short distances like when i'm at work if i'm going to go to a restraint for lunch just choosing one close enough to walk uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4221-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
six o'clock at night and well now i've got to go well that's one that's one reason i actually do the	walking	where i tried other thing is it has a point to it oh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4221-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
well this is something i just got back from working out yes um i'd spend about five or ten minutes stretching and then i i used to be just a walker i i was really into	walking	about three miles everyday and oh did you	#telephone#	telephone_sw4248-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah uh my exercise program i used i did run uh for several reasons i now do mostly	walking	uh one was that i had a knee injury i stepped in a	#telephone#	telephone_sw4250-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah that too i mean uh the um but the reason why i noticed you were talking about	walking	i i don't if i walk i'd have to walk like ten miles i think to you know for it to really sort of get the same benefit as running if i run uh really hard yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4250-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh now tell me about the tennis shoes for running and how what a difference that makes well um i found out what a difference it makes i just had regular	walking	shoes that i was running in um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4255-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh really yeah Reebok	walking	shoes and they just did not do the job at all so about a week after i started running my shin started hurting i got shin splints	#telephone#	telephone_sw4255-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
yeah and little things that they point out to me when i was	walking	around well this was done because of this or this was done because of that so they're actually kind of thinking it through huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4256-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
oh yeah well you do i mean it's it's really jogging but i mean you can push yourself at different levels how hard you run well even just	walking	well but you know like say riding a bike where if you go really slow it's pretty much coasting you're not even doing anything	#telephone#	telephone_sw4281-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and uh so i get to wear  just uh how shall i say it uh	walking	shoes as opposed to dress shoes and um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4622-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
um-hum well	walking	how shall i say it kind of like Avia uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4622-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
like Avia uh	walking	shoes uh well that's nice comfortable stuff	#telephone#	telephone_sw4622-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
you know nicer usually nice summer slacks or more sometimes skirts stuff like that so then it's still you know the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of	walking	and coming in out of the office but you still have to have a professional	#telephone#	telephone_sw4622-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
so we did look around i think my wife is much better than i am at just	walking	into a place and getting a feeling for  whether it's a loving and caring place or not and uh so i would always trust her judgment on that hm	#telephone#	telephone_sw4649-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
uh have you have you done any jogging i tell you said you you did on the on the bike and on the treadmill in the in the uh clubs no i've done some	walking	with friends in the past but i find that when you do that you do more chatting than you do exercise and that's not really beneficial um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4721-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
and they worked with her and got her	walking	and got her taking kind of taking care of herself and so she was able to come back home yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4799-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
