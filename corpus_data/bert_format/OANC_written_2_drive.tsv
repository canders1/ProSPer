aces most blame on how contemporary children are reared. [SEP] Child-centeredness, Damon explains, has become an excuse for a rudderless parenting and educational culture that makes few demands while fostering in children a stress-free, “feel-good” attitude in which children are told, ”You’re lovable,” “You’re great,” “You’re terriﬁc,” regardless of what they do. [SEP] But because these messages have no basis in meaningful attainment, they are counterproductive. [SEP] Sooner or later, children see through them, come to mistrust the adults who repeat them, and begin to doubt themselves. [SEP] Damon neither endorses the insensitivity of adult dominance nor the tumultuous reign of the child. [SEP] Instead, he underscores that children are avid, active learners, but adults must cultivate their	drive	toward mastery. [SEP] They must induce children to develop talents, skills, good values, and a sense of accomplishment through engagement not just in activities that are easy and fun, but in ones that are meaningful and challenging—that help them sustain eort in the face of diculty, overcome obstacles, and advance to greater heights. [SEP] As Damon’s message suggests, in building an eective vision of child development and child rearing, neither the child’s inner thoughts and feelings nor the role of adult guidance can be singularly extolled or wholeheartedly ignored. [SEP] To do either leads parents and educators to become trapped in a false opposition, to vacillate, and to think in oversimpliﬁed ways about how best to help children realize their potential to learn and become personally and	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
Imagination and Creativity In addition to its contribution to many nonplay skills, make-believe can be examined on its own terms: as an imaginative activity that expresses salient aspects of the child’s inner cognitive and emotional life. [SEP] In Vygotsky’s theory, the	drive	to fantasize and engage in role play does not fade away with childhood. [SEP] Instead, he maintained, the imagination of later years is an internalized, condensed form of early childhood make-believe that can be considered play without action. [SEP] We typically experience it as an elaborate stream of consciousness made up of mental images and silent self-talk that meanders along, remarking on new experiences, reﬂecting on the past, and predicting the future.50 [SEP] By introducing fantasy elements into consciousness, this inventive private commentary probably helps us cope with the mundane, repetitive aspects of our daily lives. [SEP] We resort to such ruminations while waiting; during long car trips or meetings; and at other monotonous or idle times.

ic story is believable, and one can say she is probably the quintessential legendary figure of the Chicano folk belief system. [SEP] The urban belief tale, sometimes just called an urban legend, is a subtype of the legend and is called such because it circulates among all classes and ages and reflects modern stresses and anxieties. [SEP] It is not only found in urban centers but in rural regions as well. [SEP] In addition to the legend of La Llorona (Weeping Woman), another widespread legend in Chicano folklore is the Vanishing Hitchhiker, although not always known by this name. [SEP] A California folklore journal first carried an article about it in 1942, and a Chicano version appears in Miller’s narrative collection from Los Angeles with a date of 1939. [SEP] The story usually involves a	drive	r who picks up a hitchhiker, often late at night and often a young girl, and he drops her off at or near her home.

[SEP] Within the low-rider subculture there exist several divisions of traditions. [SEP] For instance, car clubs are an important aspect of the culture and a way to showcase cars in competitions. [SEP] One of the oldest ongoing car clubs in Los Angeles is named the Dukes. [SEP] Members of car clubs are referred to as “clubbers,” and they compete for trophies, ride in car caravans, and often participate in fund-raising events. [SEP] “Cholos” are considered another group, less financially stable with more modern cars, less ornate, and likely more Mexicano in orientation. [SEP] A third group, the “cha chas,” are Mexican immigrants, who	drive	the Toyotas and Volkswagens, and are a smaller group. [SEP] Low Rider Magazine was founded during the 1970s to provide a forum for low riders and the culture that surrounds low riding. [SEP] Low Rider has been very instrumental in the widespread growth of low-rider car clubs, and “Low Rider Happenings,” throughout the Southwest. [SEP] Low riding is looked upon as a very Chicano cultural phenomenon, yet it has spread to other ethnic communities. [SEP] There are many non-Chicano car clubs, and the Japanese have also adopted it. [SEP] Low Rider has been publishing a Japanese edition for the past four years and has organized low-rider car shows in Tokyo and Osaka.

SEP] It is not impossible that someone might actually prefer the secure life of the slave to the anxious life of the free person who must care for himself. [SEP] There are two distinct grounds on which the law might sensibly prohibit the possibility recognized in Exodus. [SEP] First, the claim might be that freedom and its blessings represent a great gift that no individual “made in God’s image” should be able to forfeit as though it were a disposable piece of property. [SEP] Alternatively, the argument might be that in principle people have the right to choose to forego their freedom, but that in reality these choices are always influenced by personal necessities that becloud the choice actually made. [SEP] This is especially true under market conditions, where the need for sustenance can	drive	people into relationships that they would not choose in and of themselves. [SEP] It is clear that even the choice of the Hebrew slave discussed in Exodus can never be shown to be completely free. [SEP] The legal arrangements also stipulate in the same passage that if during his period of servitude the slave acquired a wife or children, then he must leave them behind when he leaves his master’s service. [SEP] Some purchased servants might decide to opt for permanent servitude simply because they cannot bear to live without their wives and family. [SEP] The full text in the quoted passage reads: “I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out free.”12 The cruelty of subjecting him to the choice between freedom and leaving his family obviously means that his choice is not free i	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
 required airlines and governmental buildings to ban smoking, but did not try to follow the model of Prohibition or the drug laws. [SEP] The policy of deferring to voluntary initiative has been more effective. [SEP] A revolution in attitudes toward smoking has occurred, largely because people were free, in effect, to decide for themselves in their homes, offices, and other spheres of influence. [SEP] They did not need the coercive force of government behind them. [SEP] For many, the limitations on governmental power represent a trivial and self-evident proposition. [SEP] But those who believe in the power of government, as I do, should pay heed. [SEP] And conservatives, who are generally skeptical of the power of government, would do well to ponder the analogies between Prohibition and the	drive	for prayer in the schools or the criminalization of flag burning. [SEP] Of course, there are some areas, such as the protection of the victims of crime, where only the government can act. [SEP] Of that problem there will be more to say later. [SEP] Allow me to take the Twenty-First Amendment out of order. [SEP] After a decade of Prohibition, the country realized in 1933 that the government simply could not act upon its noble motives. [SEP] The Constitution had to be amended once more, this time to countermand the Eighteenth Amendment. [SEP] Some states, for example, Mississippi, retained Prohibition for many more years. [SEP] As a colleague from ostensibly dry Mississippi once jibed, “Prohibition is better than no liquor at all.” [SEP] The country as a whole finally decided, however, that a	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
face a constant challenge from those who are unsatisfied with the successes of civil society. [SEP] They want government to join the action. [SEP] Nowhere is this more evident than in the politics of schooling. [SEP] We worry constantly, perhaps with good reason, that the young in America are growing up with the wrong values. [SEP] They supposedly suffer from all the mistakes of their elders who promote violence on television and have permitted the country to be flooded with guns, which, as everyone knows, enable teenagers who go on rampages to gain a few hours of prime time news coverage. [SEP] One wonders, however, whether it is an effective response for government to require, as suggested in one Republican initiative, schools to post the Ten Commandments on schoolhouse walls. [SEP] This	drive	toward governmental intervention in the field of value formation has been nowhere more evident—and questionable—than the recently revived push for a constitutional amendment to protect the flag against protestors who want to burn it. [SEP] The commitment to the flag has surely been one of the stable and recognized provisions of our sub rosa constitution. [SEP] We do well to cultivate reverence toward the flag, which coupled with national rituals like the pledge, instills sentiments of national loyalty in our children. [SEP] Although patriotic sentiments toward the flag antedate the Civil War, we begin to find, in the early twentieth century, a duty of reverence toward the Stars and Stripes formulated as a legal issue.

[SEP] Two basic strategies present themselves.

The first additional system consists in pyrophosphate, PP, a high-energy dimer of monophosphate that breaks down to form two monophosphates, P + P. Like any reaction, the reaction converting PP to P + P has an equilibrium, hence an equilibrium ratio of PP and P. In the presence of excess PP compared to equilibrium, the reaction flows toward equilibrium by the spontaneous cleavage of PP to yield P + P. My purpose in invoking the exergonic conversion of PP to P + P is to utilize the loss of free energy in this exergonic reaction to	drive	the DNA trimer-hexamer reaction beyond its own equilibrium, leading thereby to an excess synthesis of the 3’CCCGGG5’ hexamer when compared to its equilibrium concentration. [SEP] Thus, the excess synthesis of the hexamer, which would not occur spontaneously, is	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
eproducing “better” with the coupling to PP than without the coupling. [SEP] Another point to note is that the coupling of the breakdown of PP to P + P with the excess synthesis of the DNA hexamer compared to the equilibrium concentration of the DNA hexamer means that energy is stored within the system. [SEP] This is true because the excess concentration of the hexamer DNA, compared to its equilibrium, could in principle be released by degradation of the hexamer to the two trimer substrates, releasing that stored free energy as this reaction couple flowed toward its own equilibrium ratio of hexamer and trimers. [SEP] Thus, the coupling to the PP to P + P reaction means that the autonomous agent stores energy internally. [SEP] Later in evolution, such internally stored energy can be used to	drive	reactions that correct errors, as in DNA repair in contemporary cells. [SEP] I am glad to thank Phil Anderson and, indirectly, John Hopfield for this point. [SEP] Once the pyrophosphate, PP, is cleaved to form P + P, as this reaction flows toward its own equilibrium ratio of PP to P, that free energy is used up. [SEP] In order to have a renewed internal supply of the free energy needed to synthesize excess hexamer, it is convenient to resynthesize pyrophosphate from the two monophosphates, P + P. I’ll return below to the meaning of “convenient,” for in a general sense, the convenience reflects the organization of processes that sustains an agent, and that organization is not convenient, it is essential.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1

Thus, our molecular autonomous agent constitutes a system with two essential features of living systems, self-reproduction and metabolism. [SEP] However, my insistence that an autonomous agent carries out a work cycle refines the generally understood concept of a metabolism to include the requirement that the metabolism carries out a work cycle. [SEP] The second feature to note is that our autonomous agent is, necessarily, a nonequilibrium system. [SEP] Free energy, here in the form of the photon, hv, and the trimer substrates is taken in and used to	drive	the linked synthesis of PP and excess DNA hexamer. [SEP] There is no agency at equilibrium. [SEP] The excess synthesis of DNA hexamer constitutes excess replication of the hexamer by virtue of the coupling of the trimer-hexamer synthesis to the PP  P + P cycle of reactions, which, as noted next, constitute a “chemical engine.” [SEP] The third feature to note is the work cycle performed by the agent. [SEP] The simplest way of seeing the work cycle here is in the behavior of the PP  P + P reaction. [SEP] In the Carnot cycle, the working gas cycles from compressed and hot to less compressed and cool, back to compressed and hot. [SEP] In our hypothetical autonomous agent, there is a macroscopic cycle of matter from PP to P + P via the reaction- forming DNA hexamer and back around to PP via th	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
mer and back around to PP via the reaction with the high-energy electron. [SEP] The macroscopic cycling of matter around this cycle is the engine at work. [SEP] (I am grateful to Peter Wills for this clarification of the concept of a chemical motor.) [SEP] In addition, depending upon the details of the kinetic constants, our autonomous agent may literally show an oscillatory concentration cycle in which PP concentration begins high and falls as P + P is formed, then the high PP concentration is reformed by use of the photon-energized exergonic e*  e reaction.

Maxwell asks us to consider the very same box with N particles in it. [SEP] But he imagines the box to be divided into two chambers by a wall with a window in it. [SEP] In the window is a flap valve. [SEP] When the flap valve is open, gas particles can pass from the left to the right box via the window, or from the right to the left box via the window. [SEP] Now, smiles Maxwell, suppose the initial state of the gas in the box is in the equilibrium macrostate. [SEP] No macroscopic work can be done by the equilibrium system. [SEP] That was Carnot’s central point. [SEP] There is plenty of energy in the random motions of the gas particles, but there is no means to extract mechanical work from it, say, to	drive	a piston. [SEP] Next, says Maxwell, warming to his point, “Imagine that my wee friend operates the flap valve such that, whenever a fast gas particle approaches the window from inside the left box toward the right box, he opens the flap and lets the faster than average, hence hotter, gas particle through. And suppose my demon also operates the flap value to let the slower than average, hence cooler, gas particles pass from the right to the left box. Well, soon the left box will be cool and the right box will be hot. And now,” concludes Maxwell with a broad smile, “we can use the macroscopic temperature dierence between the left and right boxes to extract mechanical work, say, by driving a piston.” [SEP] There you have it.

 molecular species able to detect such displacements from equilibrium come into existence, more such coupled catalyzed exergonic and endergonic reactions come into existence. [SEP] In general, it would begin to appear that as a higher diversity of entities come into existence  entities that are then necessarily more complex  their modes of being in nonequilibrium conditions increase in diversity and subtlety. [SEP] In turn, the very existence of sets of these increasingly diverse and complex entities gives them an increased number of ways, and so an increased probability, to couple with one another such that one may measure a displacement from equilibrium of the other; hence, these entities happen upon a source of energy that can be and is extracted to do work. [SEP] In turn, that work may	drive	nonspontaneous processes to create still more complex molecular species or other entities in the adjacent possible. [SEP] In short, there appears to be some positive relationship between the diversity and complexity of structures or processes and the diversity and complexity of the features of a nonequilibrium system, which can be detected and measured by the detecting structure to identify a source of energy, then couple to the source of energy and actually extract work. [SEP] If there is a relation such that diverse and complex features of nonequilibrium systems useful as sources of energy can best be detected by equally diverse and complex structures, then there appears to be some generalized “autocatalytic” set of processes in the universe since the big bang, and in a biosphere, by whic	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] Yes. [SEP] What might this be about? [SEP] I’ll say it again. [SEP] The universe is full of sources of energy. [SEP] Nonequilibrium processes and structures of increasing diversity and complexity arise that constitute sources of energy and that measure, detect, and capture those sources of energy, build new structures that constitute constraints on the release of energy, and hence	drive	nonspontaneous processes to create more such diversifying and novel processes, structures, and energy sources. [SEP] I find it delightful that we hardly have the concepts to state these issues; surely we have as yet no coherent theory for this burgeoning of process and structure. [SEP] Whatever it is, a biosphere does it. [SEP] It was quite barren in Nebraska, wherever Nebraska was, four billion years ago.

artition daughter chromosomes into two daughter cells, the evolution of controlled recombination, seem to become instantiated as “biological laws,” even though they are entirely historically contingent. [SEP] Changing the biological laws in evolution seems rather like the generation of a novel axiom from which new consequences can be derived. [SEP] On this interpretation, my claim that we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere becomes the claim that the biosphere keeps generating new “causal axioms” from which it generates novel forms. [SEP] Then just as we do not know where the new axioms of a formal system come from, save as the free invention of the logician involved, so it would seem that we cannot prestate the new generative exaptations that allow evolution to	drive	in new directions. [SEP] I am not entirely persuaded by this analogy to finding ever new axioms in Godel’s theorem, but it does have some coherence. [SEP] Indeed, the failure to be able to prestate the configuration space of the biosphere may be yet deeper. [SEP] I will take a stab at a proof. [SEP] I begin by vitiating my assumption that one cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere, then try to show that the implications are that the number of potentially relevant properties is vastly hyperastronomical and that there is no way in the lifetime of the universe for any knower within the universe to enumerate, let alone work with, all the possible properties or categories and their causal consequences.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] One axis shows the order-chaos axis for a single isolated bacterium, measured by Derrida curve criteria, with order on the left, near the origin, and chaos on the right. [SEP] The remaining axes show C and S. If a given cell is at the phase transition between order and chaos, and additional molecular inputs, S per cell, come from C dierent types of cells, the total connectivity in the cell is raised from KN to KN + CS.

Recall the Noah’s Vessel experiment, with two of every species ground up in a blender, breaking all cell membranes, comingling the trillion or so proteins of the hundred million species with the thousands of small molecule metabolites. [SEP] A supracritical explosion of chemical diversity would presumably ensue. [SEP] As I noted, life has learned to avoid that fate. [SEP] Cells are subcritical. [SEP] Were they not, then any new chemical that chanced to enter the cells of Fredricka the fern would unleash a cascade of synthesis of novel molecular species, some of which would presumably kill poor Fredricka. [SEP] Best defense? [SEP] Stay subcritical. [SEP] Why mess with that mess? [SEP] But recall that a mixed microbial community should be able to be	drive	n to the subcritical-supracritical boundary by increasing the diversity of microbial species present and/or hitting the community with a sucient diversity of novel small molecule species. [SEP] My argument follows that if the community is supracritical, the novel cascading molecular species will kill o some of the microbial species, thereby lowering the community toward the subcritical regime.

ntermediate complexity because we collectively and persistently create nonstationary worlds together. [SEP] In the agent-based computer models Vince has created for his thesis, just this behavior is seen. [SEP] Indeed, we allow agents to evolve how much of the past history of the interactions they will pay attention to and how complex their models of one another will be  one, four, or fifty Fourier modes. [SEP] Agents evolve in a history and complexity space to find currently optimal amounts of history and complexity to use to optimally predict their neighbors. [SEP] In our little world, the agents evolve to use a modest history, ignoring the distant past, and only modestly complex theories of one another. [SEP] We have found evidence of a further, perhaps generic, property that appears to	drive	such systems to settle down, then change in a sudden burst. [SEP] As the system of agents and actions settles down to some repeatable behavior, an increasingly wide range of alternative theories, simple and very complex, fit the same data. [SEP] But the complex theories, with many Fourier modes, attempt to predict fine details of the repeatable behavior. [SEP] As those theories become more complex, they are more fragile because they can be disconfirmed by ever more minor fluctuations in the repeatable behavior. [SEP] Sooner or later such a fluctuation happens, and the agents with the complex disconfirmed theories change theories and actions radically, setting up a vast avalanche of changes of theories and actions that sweeps the system, driving the collective behavior far from any repeatabl	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] Visit the small Manuel Cabanas Museum, just off the square, to see a nice collection of woodcuts that ranges from rustic scenes to famous statesmen and composers. [SEP] Today Vila Real is sleepy but quietly dignified. [SEP] A walk around the old quarter reveals a number of fine, brightly painted houses along pedestrian-only streets. [SEP] Vila Real de Santo António’s main appeal is as the ferry port to Ayamonte across the water in Spain.

Without doubt, the initial lure of the city is its numerous historic buildings. [SEP] The lines of tall, narrow houses with their pretty gables rest beside picture-perfect tree-lined canals. [SEP] They are connected by ornate iron bridges and cobbled walkways, which have changed little for over 300 years, in fact, since they felt the footfall of such inhabitants as the artist Rembrandt and explorer Abel Tasman, who gave his name to Tasmania. [SEP] Amsterdam is a wonderful city for visitors. [SEP] Small enough to stroll around, and with the canal side streets too narrow for tour buses, you can’t	drive	past all the best attractions at high speed. [SEP] Here, there is no glass window between you and reality. [SEP] You have to feel the summer sun, or see your breath on a crisp winter morning as you step out to see what Amsterdam is all about. [SEP] If you take a canal tour, the quiet boats allow you to float slowly along, away from the noise of the modern world. [SEP] The museums could keep you busy for weeks. [SEP] Art collections, historic houses, and memorials to heroes and heroines can all be found here. [SEP] For entertainment after the sun sets, there are over 40 different performances in the city every evening. [SEP] The Netherlands National Opera and National Ballet are based here, and there are numerous orchestral, musical, and comedy venues, along with revues and dance shows.

Tiburon is the quieter of the two, while Sausalito is more of a tourist trap, but both have a colorful Mediterranean atmosphere, with art galleries, yacht harbors, craft shops, and pleasant bistros and cafés out on the boardwalk overlooking the bay. [SEP] Farther inland is the woodsy residential paradise of Mill Valley, and behind it rises the 2,604-ft (794-m) summit of Mount Tamalpais. [SEP] The mountain bike was invented here in the 1970s, and there are plenty of hiking and biking trails, but if you’re feeling lazy you can	drive	along the Panoramic Highway to within a few hundred yards of the summit. [SEP] The view from the top is memorable — across the bay to the city and then beyond to Mount Diablo, and on a clear day you might even catch a glimpse of the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains. [SEP] Highway 1 twists through the hills to the coast, past the Muir Woods National Monument, named after John Muir, the Scots-born environmentalist, who founded California’s conservation movement at the turn of the 19th century.

The scenic valleys of Napa and Sonoma have been producing wine on a commercial basis since the middle of the 19th century, and today California wines are considered to be among the finest in the world. [SEP] There are more than 250 vineyards — or wineries as they are called — and most of them offer guided tours and tastings. [SEP] Some of the more interesting wineries to visit are Mondavi, Beringer, Sterling, and Beaulieu in Napa, and Matanzas Creek and Benzinger in Sonoma. [SEP] You can	drive	to the vineyards from San Francisco via Interstate 80, across the Bay Bridge, but bus tours are also available through the major providers. [SEP] You can also arrange a custom tour, visiting wineries of your choice, through Wine Country Jeep Tours (Tel. 800/539-5337, toll-free in US). [SEP] The Napa Valley Wine Train is another option for a scenic hands-off chug through the valley, including lunch or dinner, but no winery visits. [SEP] A note of warning: The entire region, and particularly the Napa Valley, is inundated with visitors all year round, especially on weekends.

[SEP] Kids will love the Sea Otter Pool and the Touch Pools, where they can both handle and learn about sea anemones, crabs, and even bat rays. [SEP] The 17-Mile Drive is a lovely scenic toll road starting at Lighthouse Avenue in Pacific Grove, a pleasant waterside town of Victorian houses and clapboard cottages a few miles beyond Monterey. [SEP] The	drive	passes through beautiful cypress groves along a wild and rocky coastline, where you can watch birds, otters, and sea lions in the wild, before passing through the famous golf courses at Pebble Beach and finally reaching the exclusive resort town of Carmel-by-the-Sea, famous for once having Clint Eastwood as mayor.

Nowhere is the clash of traditional values and modern industry more acute than it is in the western Subarctic. [SEP] Here, some 11,000 native peoples from 20 tribes in the Northwest Territories sharing the Athapaskan language have joined as the Dene Nation. [SEP] Together with the Métis Association (descendants of intermarried French fur traders and Plains Indians), they are involved in a tussle with private oil and natural gas companies to protect land rights and traditional culture. [SEP] Proponents of an Arctic gas pipeline passing through Indian lands in the Mackenzie Valley to northern Alberta argued that the Dene need revenues from the pipeline to escape poverty, and that in any case they no longer have an autonomous culture.

Beyond the City Wall From the Parc de l’Esplanade,	drive	up the Côte de la Citadelle hill road and through a tunnel for a guided tour around a powerful bastion of fears long gone. [SEP] The French built the starshaped Citadel in 1750 to resist the British. [SEP] The British enlarged it in 1820 to defend Québec City against the Americans, but their cannons never fired a shot in anger. [SEP] The garrison was British-manned for only 20 years before being handed over to Canadian troops. [SEP] Today it is the home of Canada’s crack Royal 22nd Regiment. [SEP] In summertime the garrison comes to life with the Changing of the Guard (10am daily, June 24–first week of Sept.) and Beating the Retreat (6pm Wed–Sat during July and August).

You’d think the chamber of commerce carved their map as a public relations gimmick, but the province really is shaped like a lobster. [SEP] In any case, many a gourmet or glutton feels that a Halifax lobster dinner is reason enough to make the trip. [SEP] But weight watchers can enjoy Nova Scotia, too. [SEP] There’s the sparkling Atlantic coastline, with its delightful little fishing ports. [SEP] Or rolling green hills across the interior to the orchards and dairy farms of Annapolis Valley. [SEP] This western side of the peninsula is rich in the poignant history of French Acadia.

Scores of lighthouses along Nova Scotia’s south shore trace a sawtoothed route of coves that over the ages offered shelter to pirates, rum-runners, and fishermen.

those marked out inside the forest. [SEP] These “New Scottish” highlands look uncannily like those in the old country. [SEP] To ram the point home, there’s even a Scottish shepherd’s cottage, Lone Shieling, off the highway at Grande Anse River. [SEP] The forest, a mixture of conifers and hardwoods, shelters white-tailed deer, black bear, moose, beaver, red fox, lynx, mink, and snowshoe hare. [SEP] Bird-watchers can spot, among many species, red-tailed hawk and the occasional bald eagle. [SEP] Fishermen should get their license at the park entrance to angle for trout or salmon (no motorboats allowed). [SEP] On the northeast corner of the park, Neil Harbor is a pleasant little fishing port with sandy beaches. [SEP] To explore the northern tip of the island, leave the park at South Harbor and	drive	16 km (10 miles) to the fishing village of Bay St. Lawrence. [SEP] Following a common seaport custom, the white clapboard village church, with its nave shaped like an upturned ship, was designed and built by local shipwrights. [SEP] Take a bracing hike along the grassy cliff top west of town, but beware of the winds. [SEP] Southwest of the park, Chéticamp is an old stronghold of Acadian culture, with a museum exhibiting craftware as it was crocheted, spun, hooked, or woven in bygone centuries.

Stanley Park Covering a magnificent peninsula proudly dominating English Bay, this is undoubtedly one of North America’s finest city parks. [SEP] Its forest of majestic Douglas firs, cedars, and Sitka spruce remind us it was once a government reserve providing mast and spar timbers for the Royal Navy. [SEP] At the turn of the century, the town leased it as a park, named after Lord Stanley, Canada’s governor general. [SEP] His bronze statue is close to the southern entrance. [SEP] Turn east off Georgia Street to take the 9-km (51/2-mile)	drive	looping the park. [SEP] More bracing is the Sea Wall Promenade, where you can walk, jog, or ride a bicycle (available for rent at the park entrance).

[SEP] On your way to Brockton Point, listen for the 9 o’clock gun, a cannon that fires at 9pm, originally to warn fishermen of the fishing curfew.

The highway through the Monashee and Selkirk mountains to Mount Revelstoke National Park follows the Eagle River and the route of the C.P.R. on the crucial stretch that enabled the railway to break through the Rockies. [SEP] At Craigellachie, right beside the road, about 25 km (15 miles) east of Shuswap Lake, a granite monolith marks the spot where the eastern and western sections linked up to form Canada’s first transcontinental railway. [SEP] At 9:22am on November 7, 1885, surrounded by top-hatted dignitaries and grimy overalled laborers, C.P.R. boss Donald Smith tucked in his flowing white beard and hammered home the famous Last Spike — after misjudging his first swing and bending a first spike over double. [SEP] Leave the Trans-Canada 11/2 km (1 mile) east of Revelstoke town to	drive	the winding Summit Road up Mount Revelstoke, 2,120 m (6,370 ft), the only mountain in Canada that you can “climb” by car. [SEP] This is the cozy way to watch the park’s landscape change from dense lowland forest, through alpine meadows dotted with wild flowers, to the bleak tundra of the high country. [SEP] From the top you look out over the Columbia and Illecillewaet river valleys and back to the Monashee Mountains. [SEP] There are no campgrounds inside the park, but if you’re planning to tent overnight along the 65 km (39 miles) of clearly marked hiking-trails, check in with the park administration office in downtown Revelstoke (P.O. Box 350, Revelstoke, B.C. VOE250; tel. 250-837-7500). [SEP] This is the place to get your detailed maps and fishing permit.

[SEP] When the C.P.R. reached Banff in 1883, the Rockies were suddenly opened up to public access, and the government decided, two years later, to preserve the region’s beauty by declaring Banff a national park. [SEP] After three railway workers discovered hot sulfur springs bubbling from the earth, their bosses built one of their grandest castle-hotels, the Banff Springs, a monument to be visited even if you’re not staying there. [SEP] The turreted edifice set down in the Bow River Valley has something of the fairytale castles of Ludwig of Bavaria. [SEP] Take a canoe out on the river.

Icefields Parkway This 233-km (140-mile)	drive	on Highway 93, up the spine of the mountain range from Lake Louise to Jasper, gives a rich sense of the Rockies’ varied beauties —  glaciers, waterfalls, lakes, and canyons. [SEP] Take a full day so that you have time to explore some of the sights on foot. [SEP] Stop first at the Crowfoot Glacier, where you can see the foot’s two remaining “toes,” the third having broken away. [SEP] The mass of ice facing you is 55 m (165 ft) thick. [SEP] At Bow Summit, leave the Parkway at the signpost to the viewpoint overlooking the lovely Peyto Lake, a deep turquoise at the height of summer. [SEP] If you have time, stop at Kilometer 119 on the Parkway, to hike up the winding path to Parker’s Ridge (2,185 m/6,560 ft) above pretty alpine meadows overlooking the Saskatchewan Glacier, the beginning of the g	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] At the Parkway’s Kilometer 200 mark, take Highway 93A to Athabasca Falls. [SEP] A comfortable boardwalk leads you on an informative nature walk right up to where the mighty river plunges over the narrow gorge. [SEP] The old fur trading post of Jasper is now a refreshingly peaceful resort town with a grand park lodge and fine facilities for rafting, canoeing, camping and other mountain sports.

Drumheller The area around this old coalmining town is famous for the prehistoric fossils and remarkably complete remains of dinosaurs whose stamping grounds were the Badlands of the Red Deer River Valley. [SEP] The 130-km (78-mile)	drive	northeast of Calgary on Highway 9 takes you through wheat-growing country where you may see the farming communities of Hutterites, an austere religious sect originally from Slovakia, often persecuted for their pacifism. [SEP] The women wear traditional dirndl costumes with headscarf and apron, while their husbands, dressed all in black with broad-rimmed hats, cultivate the heavy beards of Old Testament prophets. [SEP] Drumheller’s Dinosaur Trail places fossils and life-size models of the beasts in their original habitat — though you have to imagine a luxuriant humid jungle in place of the present-day arid desert.

[SEP] But the town has created another treasure trove in the astounding West Edmonton Mall (Stony Plain Road, Highway 16), a shopping center to end all shopping centers, complete with a waterpark and attracting as many as 140,000 customers on a busy day, 40 per cent of them from the United States.

The old French-speaking community of St-Boniface, now a Winnipeg suburb, is on the east side of the Red River. [SEP] Its Avenue Taché boasts the city’s oldest building, the 1846 convent of the Grey Nuns. [SEP] It’s now the parish museum, devoted in part to the life of Louis Riel. [SEP] Next door, you’ll find his simple grave in the cemetery of St-Boniface basilica, rebuilt behind its white stone façade after a recent fire. [SEP] Children enjoy the 2-hour ride in the four wooden coaches and caboose of the Prairie Dog Central steam train, from St. James Station to and from Grosse Isle, 25 km (15 miles) northwest of town.

 Despite the destruction, Garachico is a little gem. [SEP] Neat houses boasting typically attractive Canarian balconies line cobbled streets, and old churches adorn pretty squares. [SEP] Unmissable, also, is the large, uninhabited rock out in the bay, and it has managed to gain for itself a place in the spiritual life of Garachico. [SEP] Without a patron saint of its own, the town has elevated the rock to be its saint! [SEP] Farther along the coast road, 8 km (5 miles) past Buenavista del Norte, lies the most westerly point on Tenerife, the Punta de Teno.

[SEP] This volcanic crater, almost a kilometer (more than a half mile) across, is green, fertile.and drops some 198 m (650 ft) down. [SEP] A scenic spiraling road leads to the top, where the Real Club de Golf enjoys such a picturesque location that even non-golfers are tempted to pick up a club. [SEP] The views from here take in the mountains, fertile valley and vast stretches of the coastline from Las Palmas to the distant south.

[SEP] Of interest, too, are the fantastic views across the ocean on a fine day to the snowcapped Mount Teide floating majestically above the clouds and the mountain peaks and lush valleys of Gran Canaria itself.

At the northern tip of the island is the small fishing port of Orzola.

[SEP] With superb beaches and a complete lack of tourist development, this is the place to get away from it all for the day. [SEP] For an unforgettable view of Isla Graciosa and much more,	drive	up to the Mirador del Río (admission: 400 ptas, r2.40).

[SEP] At the summit and with commanding views of the surrounding mountains and with the Atlantic Ocean shimmering in the distance, is a delightful combination of café, bar and viewpoint that owes its creative design to none other than César Manrique. [SEP] Betancuria, by far the most attractive and visited inland town on the island, is an oasis of greenery on this barren island. [SEP] Although the riverbed here is almost perpetually dry, the town is fortunate to have a high water table. [SEP] Because of its theoretical invulnerability at the heart of the island, it was made Fuerteventura’s first capital in the early 15th century. [SEP] However, in 1539 somehow the ravaging Berber pirates overcame the mountains (which still provide a difficult	drive	today), and destroyed the original cathedral. [SEP] The present 17th-century church, Iglesia de Santa María is a splendid building and hosts many interesting treasures. [SEP] Look at the unusual wooden beams between the flagstones on the floor, the wooden altar and choir, and the decorated pulpit. [SEP] Adjacent to the museum is a leather factory-cum-shoe-shop, set in an atmospheric old building. [SEP] Wander round this lovely little town and admire the view from across the bridge, where there is an unpretentious restaurant/bar and a gift shop. [SEP] Just south of Betancuria is the neat and pretty village of Pájara, but a stop at Antigua, on the other side of the mountains is in order. [SEP] This is reached either by continuing on the loop past Tuineje, or backtracking from Betancuria and t	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
South of San Miguel, you will find the major cruise port at La Ceiba, around 3 km (2 miles) from town. [SEP] Several large cruise vessels dock each week, bringing a flurry of activity; taxi	drive	rs increase their speed to make the most of the business. [SEP] There is a good beach at La Ceiba and a number of hotels, plus several dive outfits have bases here — you can book a class or rent equipment. [SEP] Farther south, in the ocean offshore, the reef holds the attention of even the most experienced divers because of its variety of animal and coral life. [SEP] Turtles, rays, sharks, and many species of colorful tropical fish can be found here, many at a reasonable depth for novice divers — though the reef walls are better left to those with experience. [SEP] The booking office for Atlantis Submarine is also here; this mini-submersible is ideal for non-divers, allowing a glimpse of the thriving underwater world without your having to get wet.

population in San Miguel. [SEP] From Punta Sur the main highway heads north up the eastern coastline. [SEP] The conditions here offer quite a contrast to the west, with the waves of the Caribbean lashing against limestone rocks, and the low vegetation leaning inward, blown by the sea breezes. [SEP] The whole area has a stark and wild beauty, reminiscent perhaps of the time when Cozumel was the haunt of pirates and renegades. [SEP] The tidal surge is very strong here, so swimming and snorkeling are not advised. [SEP] Other than a few farms, there is little development until you reach Playa Morena, with its bar and souvenir stand. [SEP] Here the road makes a sharp left turn to cut across the heart of the island. [SEP] If you wish to continue north from here (on foot, horseback, or four-wheel	drive	vehicle), you will eventually reach the northern lighthouse at Punta Molas, having passed the Mayan ruins of El Castillo Real along the way. [SEP] Take the sensible precautions if you make this trip — drinking water, sun protection, insect repellent, and an extra layer of clothing are all advisable. [SEP] The road leading back to San Miguel, called the Carretera Transversal, hosts a few souvenir stands where prices may be a little lower than in town — if you’re prepared to barter. [SEP] Six km (4 miles) from Playa Morena is the entrance to the San Gervasio Archaeological Park. [SEP] The remains of San Gervasio are located several kilometers from the site entrance, and though not on the scale of the major Mayan settlements of the mainland, the beautiful tropical park environment makes the ru	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
The other big temple in town, Shanhua Monastery, faces the old city wall, which is undergoing renovation. [SEP] The monastery dates from the Tang Dynasty, but it was largely rebuilt after a fire. [SEP] Standing in the grand, red-walled pavilion are 24 celestial guardians, each of distinct mien. [SEP] A circular “moon gate” in the side wall of the monastery leads to the Five Dragon Wall (Wulongbi), transplanted here from a former Confucian temple. [SEP] This ceramic screen resembles the lavish Nine Dragon Wall in the town center, but here the middle dragon, terrifyingly, faces forward. [SEP] A major attraction near Datong is the Temple Suspended Over the Void (Xuankongsi), situated a two-hour	drive	south through a barren sandstone plateau. [SEP] Tours usually stop along the way at one of the area’s cave houses, where residents are happy to show off their hand-dug quarters. [SEP] The sixth-century temple is spectacular, with over 40 halls and pavilions which are joined by ornate catwalks, suspended as if by magic on the face of a sheer limestone cliff.

Leshan From the provincial capital of Chengdu, a three-hour	drive	via a new expressway through populous Sichuan (Szechuan) Province ends at the town of Leshan, the base for visits to a monumental riverside Buddha and to one of four sacred mountains of Chinese Buddhism, Emeishan. [SEP] A 13th-century poet wrote that the most beautiful scenery of China is found in Sichuan, and, indeed, some of the best of that scenery is concentrated in Leshan. [SEP] Here, three rivers converge and flow along the city wall, and far away in the mist rises Mt. Emei. [SEP] Open boats ferry visitors from Leshan to the site of the Great Buddha (Dafo). [SEP] Whether seen from the river or, later, from the hillsides, the world’s largest seated Buddha is an impressive spectacle. [SEP] Carved from the cliffside by a monk starting in the year 713, its height is 71 m (233 ft). [SEP] T	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
North of Málaga Just an hour’s	drive	north of Málaga lies some magnificent mountain scenery. [SEP] The national park of El Torcal de Antequera is a high limestone plateau that has been eroded by rainwater into a fantasy landscape of fluted pinnacles and towers. [SEP] Hikers can explore the marked trails, which are up to 5 km (3 miles) in length and wind among the rocks, and enjoy panoramic views back to Málaga and the distant blue Mediterranean. [SEP] This is where you will also find a most wonderful small hotel, La Posada del Torcal. [SEP] Near the town of Alora, you will find the breathtaking gorge known as the Garganta del Chorro. [SEP] Three hundred meters (1,000 feet) in depth, this sheer-sided canyon is cut by the Guadalhorce River. [SEP] It is also accessible from Málaga by train; ask for a ticket to El Chorro.

Inland Excursions For a complete contrast to the sun, sea, and sangría atmosphere of the coast, you need only	drive	inland for a few hours to reach the cultural, historical, and architectural attractions of Ronda, Jerez de la Frontera, Sevilla, Córdoba and Granada — the great cities of Andalucía. [SEP] If your time is limited, try one of the day trips offered in all the major resorts or focus your attention on Ronda. [SEP] Most of the other destinations require an overnight stay.

Within its bounds can be found an amazing array of animal, bird, and plant life, but what you see is very much dependent upon the time of year you visit and, even then, can be very hit or miss. [SEP] The only way to really see the park is on a tour organized by Coop. [SEP] Andaluz Marismas del Rocio, whose large-wheel buses depart from the visitors’ center at El Acebuche. [SEP] Be forewarned, though: this is a very bumpy, rough ride, and definitely not advisable for those with artificial hips or physical handicaps. [SEP] Lasting about four hours, it enters the sand dunes at Matalascañas and the first part of the trip is along 35 km (nearly 20 miles) of unspoiled beaches. [SEP] The only human residents here are the fishermen living in what look like very ramshackle huts, albeit with 4-wheel	drive	vehicles and TV antennas on display. [SEP] The vast stretches of salt marshes are fascinating, with many animals living along the edge of the grassland adjoining them. [SEP] The huge sand dunes, perpetually changing, make for a surreal sight. [SEP] Laguna de Medina Across the Guadalquivir and just about 10 km (6 miles) east of Jerez de la Frontera is this small lake, one of the last stops in Europe for birds migrating south from northern and central Europe to Africa at the end of August. [SEP] In periods of drought it is attractive to birds that usually reside at Doñana, and around 50 species have been observed here.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
On the road to Knossós, look for the Natural History Museum of Crete — an often overlooked attraction but worthwhile for those who enjoy geology, flora, and fauna. [SEP] Exhibits concentrate on endemic species and the diverse environments that Crete has to offer. [SEP] It also examines man’s effect on the island from his earliest arrival to the present day. [SEP] Other classical sites lay below Iráklion near the south coast. [SEP] Take the road to Agía Vavára, in a vine-filled valley skirting the looming mountains of the Ida range to the west. [SEP] Here you’ll find the Messará Plain, a wide fertile valley surrounded by hills, which has been a center for farming since ancient times. [SEP] For a pretty	drive	along the upper reaches of the valley, take the road to Zarós from Agía Vavára. [SEP] The scenery is magnificent and you can visit Moní Vrontisí, a small monastery in the hills above the town, which was the original home of the Damaskinós icons — now in Agía Ekaterínis in Iráklion. [SEP] This road leads through the villages of Kamáres where there is a large cave, and links up with the Amari Valley to the west (see page 62). [SEP] To reach the ancient sites drop down from Agía Vavára on to the Plain. [SEP] Near the village of Agía Déka — named after ten saints who were martyred here — and widely scattered in farmland, are the remains of Górtis (Gortyn), capital of the island during the Roman era (from 65 b.c.) and also an important city in Minoan times.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
Beyond you’ll find the tiny Barrio de Santa Cruz. [SEP] This quarter is all that remains of the Villa Vieja, or old town. [SEP] You can still see fascinating glimpses of traditional narrow streets where houses are decorated with potted plants and wrought-iron grilles. [SEP] From this barrio you’ll be able to see the most prominent sight in Alicante, the historic Castillo de Santa Bárbara, perched 115 metres (350 feet) above the city on Mount Benacantil. [SEP] The site has been fortified since prehistoric times and offers beautiful views of Aitana, San Juan, Santa Pola, and Benidorm and Tabarca islands in the distance. [SEP] To get to the castle,	drive	up the winding road to the summit or use the lift at the far end of Calle Juan Bautista Lafora, close to Postiguet beach. [SEP] Santa Bárbara, built by the Carthaginians in the third century b.c., was so well fortified that for nearly 2,000 years nobody conquered it. [SEP] Only when the French succeeded in blowing up part of the garrison, during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1707, was the castle taken. [SEP] On the opposite side of town in the Barrio San Blas is the smaller Castillo de San Fernando, begun during the War of Independence (1808–1814). [SEP] The castle, set above the trees of the small Parque Municipal, provides a favourite spot for viewing Santa Bárbara and the port in the late afternoon.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
Inland from Alicante For a change of scenery,	drive	north of Alicante into the rocky, lunar-like landscape of the Cabeço d’Or mountains. [SEP] This is where you’ll find the Cuevas de Canalobre (Candelabrum Cave), which is reached by following the N-340 from San Juan de Alicante until the turn-off for Busot, where signs mark the way to the cave. [SEP] Floodlights dramatize the eerie ranks of gigantic stalagmites and stalactites, which crowd chambers up to 115 metres (350 feet) high. [SEP] The acoustics are so exceptional that summer concerts are held in the caves. [SEP] Jijona also lies within easy reach of the provincial capital. [SEP] This town, just 27 km (14 miles) from Alicante on the N-340, is renowned for the manufacture of turrón, an exotic sweet of Moorish origin, made from ground almonds, orange-blossom honey, egg white, and sugar. 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
The North Coast The Costa Blanca’s reputation for magnificent beaches and lively resorts comes from the northern stretch of coast. [SEP] Take the N-332 from Alicante and	drive	through Campello to the fishing port of Villajoyosa. [SEP] This picturesque village, some 30 km (18 miles) from the provincial capital, is more authentically Spanish in character than Benidorm, its cosmopolitan neighbour. [SEP] Wind your way towards the sea through the narrow streets of the old town, and suddenly you’ll see a group of housefronts in sun-bleached blues, pinks, and yellows. [SEP] White-rimmed doors and windows, black wrought-iron grilles, green blinds, and a massive Gothic church give the impression of a sparkling diadem — but then Villajoyosa literally means “Jewelled Town.”	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
Directly above the old town, the Ermita de San Feliú (Saint Felix’s Hermitage) commands a wide view. [SEP] Although it has been a Christian bastion since the third century, it was a pagan sacrificial site long before that. [SEP] Continue uphill to the fortress, which is, in fact, two castles. [SEP] Ramparts connect the smaller pre-Roman Castillo Menor (Small Castle) with the Roman and post-Roman Castillo Mayor (Main Castle), once notorious for its dungeon. [SEP] Disgraced princes and other noblemen were confined here, their only solace being the ruined 15th-century chapel adjacent. [SEP] Leave Játiva on the C-340 and	drive	up into the highlands where thick-fleeced sheep and isolated farmhouses complete a memorable vista. [SEP] Pass through Albaida, known for its candle-making, and Onteniente, an industrial town, to picturesque Bocairente. [SEP] Visit the village during late summer for the festival of folk dancing, or for February’s Fiesta of Moors and Christians. [SEP] The sombre bull-ring was hacked from solid rock for the Corrida. [SEP] For a town of barely 5,000 inhabitants, Bocairente’s two small museums are impressive: the Museo Histórico (Historical Museum) is noted for a collection of Stone Age pottery, and the Museo Parroquial (Parish Museum) exhibits important paintings by Juan de Juanes, Ribalta, and Sorolla.

New Havana The walls surrounding Old Havana were razed during the 19th century to allow the city to expand westward. [SEP] The long, curvaceous, and crumbling Malecón (breakwater), a six-lane highway alongside the city’s north shore, links the districts of Central Havana and Vedado. [SEP] The victim of harmful salt spray, the seafront	drive	is now more a seafront dive. [SEP] At its eastern end, primary-colored buildings — a showcase of tragic splendor — seem to fall apart before your eyes. [SEP] Havana’s youth congregate along the Malecón on fine evenings, flying kites, necking, swimming off the rocks, and setting out to sea in giant inner tubes to fish. [SEP] Although most visitors will want to concentrate on historic and museum-like Old Havana, the newer districts provide a fascinating view of the areas where most people live and work. [SEP] The most interesting districts of New Havana are Central Havana and Vedado. [SEP] The former is a congested, lower-middle-class barrio with few attractions for visitors, although a walk along its dusty streets and crumbling façades can be an eye-opening experience.

Playa Santa Lucía An hour-and-a-half	drive	(110 km/68 miles) from Camagüey on the north coast, remote Playa Santa Lucía beckons sun worshippers with resort hotels strung along a particularly fine peninsular strip of sand. [SEP] Each hotel backs directly onto the beach. [SEP] A superb coral reef lies offshore, and diving here is excellent. [SEP] Aside from a couple of roadside bars, however, nightlife is limited to hotel entertainment. [SEP] The only other drawback is the mosquitoes, as voracious as anywhere on the island. [SEP] To counter the isolation of Playa Santa Lucía, the tourist authorities offer a wide range of excursions, including a rodeo at Rancho King, deep-sea fishing, and boat and helicopter trips for days on the beach at such unspoiled cays as Cayo Sabinal and Cayo Saetía.

The ruminative buffalo pulls plows and carts, then wallows in the mud of a village pond. [SEP] Chickens run in and out of doorways and often may be seen peering out from roosts on the second floor of houses. [SEP] Under the eaves, bundles of maize hang to dry along with large cucumbers. [SEP] Pumpkin vines climb over rooftops. [SEP] Saturday is a good day to visit Dakshinkali (a 45-minute	drive	from Kathmandu to the southern end of the valley), when thousands of pilgrims bring chickens and goats to sacrifice to Kali. [SEP] Sacrifices also take place on Tuesday. [SEP] The shrine is at the bottom of a shady glen by a brook. [SEP] Carrying their offerings by the feet (incidentally, only male animals may be sacrificed), women form a line on one side and men on the other. [SEP] The altar where the blood will be spilled is out of sight, behind a wall where a loudspeaker screeches hymns to Kali. [SEP] Under a bridge, a cauldron bubbles. [SEP] Decapitated fowl are chucked in to speed the plucking and goats are seared to remove the hair. [SEP] The offal is thrown into the stream.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
age dates from the seventh century. [SEP] Legend has it that as Vishnu floated partly submerged in the primeval ocean, a lotus grew out of his navel, issuing Brahma, whose sole task was to create the world. [SEP] The king cannot visit this shrine, as to look upon what is considered to be an image of himself, an incarnation of Vishnu, would be a forecast of death. [SEP] On festival days worshippers blanket the statue with flowers. [SEP] Beyond is Shivapuri Watershed and Wildlife Preserve, good place for a day hike. [SEP] If there is any one spot outside the cities that is a must, it is Changu Narayan. [SEP] The oldest temple in the valley and unquestionably one of the most interesting, it sits on an isolated hilltop a few miles north of Bhaktapur and just south of the Sankhu road. [SEP] The	drive	from Bhaktapur cuts across paddies and climbs past thickets of bamboo to the ridge top. [SEP] A misty morning makes the scene even more evocative of the past. [SEP] The temple is in the center of a walled enclosure, with a treasury of small sculptures and shrines dotted about. [SEP] One of several masterpieces dedicated to the cult of Vishnu is a broken eighth-century stone panel, a Licchavi work. [SEP] There is a lovely fifth-century Garuda, and near it, on a memorial pillar, the earliest historical document in Nepal, an inscription of the same period concerning the Licchavi King Manadeva. [SEP] Doors, niches, struts, and cornices are superbly decorated, yet the temple and compound retain a human dimension and are not overwhelming.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
From Kathmandu, short trips to the valley rim make it possible for those with limited time to see the high mountains at sunrise or sunset. [SEP] Nagarkot, which stands on the crest of a ridge at 2,195 m (7,200 ft), is about an hour’s	drive	from Bhaktapur and one of the best places in the Kathmandu area for viewing the Himalayas. [SEP] From this aerie on the rim of the Kathmandu Valley, 322 km (200 miles) of the Himalayas stretch out before you in an immense wall of rock and ice. [SEP] Although there are excellent views from the many lodges and hotels here, the view is even better from a nearby observation tower, which can be reached in about an hour’s walk from Nagarkot. [SEP] From this observation tower, it is possible to see as far as Mount Everest. [SEP] Most visitors come for the sunrise or sunset on the mountains, and though the weather is often at its clearest in the early morning, low clouds and fog often obstruct the view. [SEP] The Kathmandu area’s other popular mountain-viewing spot is the village of Dhulikhel, whic	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
SEP] The land was transformed by hundreds of small wells sunk to extract the precious liquid. [SEP] In 1947 the first offshore rig was opened and the Mississippi valley became a hub of oil and gas production and storage. [SEP] After the Second World War new highways led to broader horizons, and suburbs began to sprawl. [SEP] Following the construction of the impressive causeway across Lake Pontchartrain in 1956, commuters even began to move to the far side of the lake, and NASA assembled thousands of technicians at suburban Michoud to produce its booster rockets. [SEP] Desegregation in schools, which hit many southern cities hard in the 1960s, passed off in New Orleans with a minimum of trouble. [SEP] Whites and blacks had always mixed more freely here than in most places in Dixie, and the	drive	for racial equality reached an historic high in 1977 when Judge Ernest “Dutch” Morial was elected the first African-American mayor. [SEP] Today “Dutch’s” son Marc carries on the family tradition as Mayor. [SEP] But if the city seems to be moving in a positive direction, the state has other problems. [SEP] As the third millennium begins, Louisiana is again suffering the problem that has plagued it throughout its history. [SEP] Federal racketeering charges have been brought against Edwin Edwards —  Louisiana State Governor until his retirement in 1996 —  and the huge trial in Baton Rouge is keeping the state on the edge of its seat.

The Moors introduced new crops, including oranges and rice, to the region. [SEP] Their highly distinctive whitewashed houses and filigree chimneys are features of Portugal to this day, as are azulejos (handpainted, glazed ceramic tiles). [SEP] Many Moorish place names also survive, including that of Fátima, the pre-eminent Catholic site in Portugal. [SEP] Unlike their successors, the Moors were tolerant of the many different peoples who lived together in Portugal, including Berbers, Arabs, Christians, and Jews. [SEP] Even so, the Moors were regarded as an occupying power by the local Christian population. [SEP] The Christian Reconquest, which sought to	drive	the Muslims out, was under way in the north by the ninth century. [SEP] It was not until 1128, when Dom Afonso Henríques became the Count of Portucale, that the struggle to regain power met with any real success.

The topographical highlight of the Arrábida peninsula is undoubtedly the Serra da Arrábida (site of a nature reserve), a mountain chain around 35 km (22 miles) long which protects the coast from the strong north winds and accounts for the Mediterranean vegetation. [SEP] The tiny little beach spot, Portinho da Arrábida, is popular with Portuguese weekenders. [SEP] Setúbal, the district capital, is just a 20-minute	drive	from Lisbon by motorway, longer if you take the picturesque route via Sesimbra and Arrábida. [SEP] This is olive and citrus country, with cows grazing among the trees. [SEP] Setúbal is a conglomeration of market town, industrial center, resort, and Portugal’s third largest fishing port. [SEP] Setúbal’s greatest historical and artistic treasure, the Gothic Igreja de Jesus, was built around 1490 by the great French architect Boytac, who later built Lisbon’s glorious Jerónimos Monastery (see page 36). [SEP] A dramatic main portal leads into the church, which boasts two inspired elements of decoration: 17th-century azulejos on the walls, and stone pillars like twisted strands of clay, fragile-looking in spite of their obviously solid dimensions.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
Lamego has a wealth of handsome Baroque mansions, as well as a scenic 13th-century castle and a 16th-century Sé (cathedral) with a 12th-century tower. [SEP] The Museu de Lamego in the old bishop’s palace houses a fine collection of Flemish tapestries and religious statues, as well as paintings by Grão Vasco of the Viseu school (see page 56). [SEP] Pinhão, upriver from Régua (both the train trip and	drive	along the river in this stretch are stunning), is an enjoyable little town with deep connections to the port wine trade. [SEP] The tiny train station displays azulejos depicting the harvest, and many important quintas owned by the biggest port concerns, as well as independently owned vineyards, hug the hills near here. [SEP] Taylor, one of the major wine players, recently opened an excellent hotel in Pinhão, the appropriately named Vintage House. [SEP] From Pinhão to Pocinho, the train snakes along the Douro’s switchbacks with stunning views at every turn (2 hours roundtrip). [SEP] Another good route is north to Tua.

The charming, sleepy town of Serpa rises neatly above the plains, 30 km (18 miles) east of Beja, on the route to Spain. [SEP] Beyond the formidable Porta da Beja, a monumental gate in the city wall, small streets wend among bright white houses. [SEP] Many of the buildings hide small cheese factories, which produce Serpa’s famous ewe’s milk cheese. [SEP] The town’s castle was partially destroyed by a Spanish attack in 1707, but still affords enjoyable views. [SEP] The walls continue past a privately owned 17th-century mansion and on to a slender aqueduct, which ends in an ancient well with a working chain-pulley system for drawing water. [SEP] A small ethnographic museum displays the wares of the agricultural and industrial workers of the area. [SEP] From Serpa a rewarding	drive	takes you south toward the eastern Algarve, through a hilly and sparsely populated landscape where shepherds tend their flocks. [SEP] Along the way is Mértola, an ancient white-washed town founded by the Phoenicians, built up by the Romans, and later seized by the Moors. [SEP] Perched on a ridge at the junction of the River Guadiana and the smaller Oeiras, the town is protected by Moorish walls and topped by a rather dilapidated castle with a profusion of storks’ nests. [SEP] Mértola bursts with history: Its church, the Igreja Matriz, betrays a previous incarnation as a mosque with a prayer niche (mihrab), while the town hall (now a museum) is constructed on Roman foundations.

s geographical context explains the strategic importance of Castro Marim, a fortress town occupied by the Moors for five centuries. [SEP] A little to the south, the sleepy but quietly dignified town of Vila Real de Santo António (the Royal Town of St. Anthony) is the last of the Algarve’s beach towns before Spain. [SEP] The town was built from scratch in just five months in 1774, aping the grid layout of Lisbon’s Baixa (lower city). [SEP] The town square, Praça do Marquês do Pombal, is the tour de force of Vila Real, with black-and-white pavement radiating from an obelisk in the center of the square like rays from the sun. [SEP] Vila Real de Santo António’s main appeal is the ferry to Ayamonte across the water in Spain. [SEP] The trip takes just 20 minutes — less time than it would take to	drive	to and over the new bridge — and the white town of Ayamonte is a fine sight as you approach it from the river. [SEP] Crossing into Spain, you will need to take your passport. [SEP] North from Sagres, along the west coast, is the one part of the Algarve that may well escape intensive development, simply because, although the beaches are pleasant and the coastline dramatic, the water is colder and the wind stronger. [SEP] For those interested in surfing or solitude, this coast may be ideal. [SEP] Aljezur’s ruined Moorish castle looks over the town, which makes a good base for neighboring beaches, such as the enormous rocky cove at Arrifana and the wider dune beach of Monte Clerigo, both of which also have their own small tourist complexes.

The road runs along the coastline and through the Bosque Estatal de Piñones, an area of beautiful sandy beaches and coconut palms that until recently was a pristine environment where sleepy cattle sat under the trees. [SEP] It is now a popular weekend picnic spot for city families, many of whom leave their litter behind when they depart. [SEP] This sort of carelessness spoils Piñones (and many other beauty spots on the eastern coastline within easy reach of San Juan); an assemblage of broken bottles, leftover food, litter, and worse is something you can’t fail to notice. [SEP] Head through Loíza, and on towards Río Grande. [SEP] Here Route 187 meets Route 3, one of the major arterial roads around Puerto Rico; it’s a very busy highway, so be aware and	drive	carefully. [SEP] Take a left and proceed to Route 191; then turn right and head up toward El Yunque (the Anvil), the most famous mountain in Puerto Rico. [SEP] Normally capped with clouds it catches from the passing sea breezes, and sometimes entirely lost in a blanket of gray storm-clouds, the 3,496-ft (1,088-m) peak stands at the center of the Caribbean National Forest, an area of virgin rain forest preserved since 1876, when the island was still a Spanish colony. [SEP] Originally a park of 12,300 acres (4,998 hectares), it now covers 28,000 acres (11,330 hectares) and is managed by the US Forestry Department. [SEP] The whole area is a place of staggering proportions: there are over 200 species of native trees. [SEP] One specimen is said to be over 2,500 years old; some trees are so wide 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
at’s some 100 billion gallons (450 billion liters) of water. [SEP] The animals that live here are also amazing. [SEP] This is one of the last habitats of the threatened Puerto Rican parrot. [SEP] The infamous coquí (see page 47)is, of course, heard everywhere. [SEP] All in all, the park in an impressive sight, with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance. [SEP] Arriving via Route 191 you’ll come right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park. [SEP] This facility presents important information about the history of the park, its plant and animal species, and its role in the local ecology. [SEP] You can then travel on higher into the park, toward the summit. [SEP] You can’t	drive	the whole 8 miles (13 km) between the visitors center and the end of the road, but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way, so there’s ample access. [SEP] Two popular stops are La Coca Falls, on the right after the 5-mile (8-km) point, and the Yokahú Observation Tower, at the 51⁄2-mile (9-km) point. [SEP] Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes. [SEP] The most spectacular cascade in the park, La Mina Falls, is just a 30-minute walk from the roadside, via Big Tree Trail. [SEP] Take a walk on any of the well-marked trails: the atmosphere is humid and the vegetation constantly damp (your best friends will be your insect repellent and your stout shoes), but the landscape is beautiful and fascinating.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
Traveling south from Fajardo you have the option of using Route 53 (a new toll road) or continuing on Route 3. [SEP] Both roads lead past to the town of Humacao, and on toward the south coast. [SEP] Just south of the Humacao is a left turn for Palmas del Mar, a growing resort area on the southeast coastline. [SEP] A residential resort community built around wonderful stretches of beach, the resort offers numerous activities, including horseback-riding, fishing, golf (two courses), and a casino. [SEP] East of the town of Yabucoa you’ll find the start of the Ruta Panoramica. [SEP] If you don’t have time to follow this entire trail, at least	drive	along Route 3 south of Yabucoa to the area around the Cendro la Pandura peak. [SEP] The road climbs via a series of switchback turns, and once at the top you’ll have a clear view of the town lying in the flat plain below. [SEP] The lifestyle of the people who live high on the hillside is fascinating. [SEP] Jíbaros (country farmers) carry machetes to the fields, accompanied by their faithful hounds. [SEP] Chickens scoot under cars as you approach. [SEP] Around every turn, you’ll marvel at how the houses can be built on such precipitous slopes. [SEP] The road then leads along the southern coastal plain through several small towns to Playa de [SEP] Ponce.

orce base, are a series of fine bathing and surfing beaches. [SEP] The most famous is Crash Boat Beach, named after a shipwreck that happened just offshore. [SEP] The beach is always busy, but the most exciting stretch is the northern section, where the fishing boats rest. [SEP] Most hours of the morning there are ships coming ashore with their meager, but extremely fresh, catch. [SEP] The boats are brightly colored and carefully tended to ensure that they are always in peak condition — not one is splintered or sun-bleached. [SEP] Traveling back along the northern coast there is little to draw the eye. [SEP] Inland however, it’s a different story. [SEP] South of the busy town of Arecibo are a number of attractions that would make a fine day-trip from San Juan (none is more than a 90-minute	drive	from the capital). [SEP] Route 129 from Arecibo leads to one of the most important and mysterious scientific instruments in the world. [SEP] Arecibo Observatory has the largest single-dish radio telescope in the world; 1,000 ft (305 m) in diameter, it has been silently scanning the universe, making maps of distant solar systems, and listening for messages from other planets since 1960. [SEP] The Observatory is part of Cornell University’s National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center; it operates 24 hours a day. [SEP] The center likes to emphasize the serious scientific work it undertakes — such as detecting extremely weak radio pulses from the very corners of the known universe, which take 100 million years to reach the earth. [SEP] Some visitors are more impressed by the fact that the observat	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
The whole cave park is a truly awesome sight, with holes 300 ft (91 m) deep and 200 ft (61 m) across, and caves thousands of feet deep, all surrounded by pristine forest. [SEP] Some say that the fountain of youth is here, in the clean water filtering through the limestone from the surface. [SEP] You don’t have to believe the legends, but taste the water anyway — it’s very sweet, and it can’t hurt to wish just a little. [SEP] From the caves it’s a short	drive	to Lares, the island’s center of coffee production. [SEP] The sweet brew made from Puerto Rican beans is considered one of the finest in the world, though production is small. [SEP] Coffee plants, usually interspersed with other crops such as bananas or plantains, can be seen growing on the high hillsides; it is a crop that enjoys good drainage and lots of humidity, which the large banana leaves help to conserve. [SEP] From Lares take Route 111 to reach the most important Amerindian site on Puerto Rico, the Parque Ceremonial Indígena Caguana (Caguana Indian Ceremonial Park). [SEP] The park is set in a wide valley surrounded by limestone peaks, one of which is said to represent the supreme god of the Taínos. [SEP] The several ceremonial ball courts discovered and excavated here suggest the s	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
urses, designed by Robert Von Hagge. [SEP] It features wide-open fairways and big greens, with plenty of water, including eight oceanside holes. [SEP] The course at El Tamarindo (Tel. [SEP] (3) 551-5031) may not be as renown as the others, but it is a lush beauty of a course set in a tropical rainforest by the sea. [SEP] The approaches to the holes wind through jungle paths, and fairways and greens are gently worked into the mountainous terrain bordering the Pacific Ocean. [SEP] In Manzanillo, golf is an integral part of the Las Hadas resort where La Mantarray golf course (Tel. [SEP] (3) 334-0000), designed by Roy and Pete Dye, is considered among the most scenic in the world. [SEP] Compact and challenging, 12 of the 18 holes are played over water, including its signature 18th hole, with a	drive	to an island green. [SEP] Further south, Ixtapa has two solid courses: the Robert Trent Jones Jr.–designed Club de Golf Ixtapa Palma Real (Tel. [SEP] (7) 553-1062), and the more challenging Club de Gold Marina Ixtapa (Tel. [SEP] (7) 553-1410), designed by Robert Von Hagge.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt	drive	written	OANC_written	1
