The Retail Forecasting Challenge We first turn to the problem of forecasting sales in retail stores. [SEP] Imagine trying to predict how many women will	walk	into a particular downtown Boston store next week prepared to pay $48 (full price) for a size-8 pair of Levi blue jeans, with “long” pant length, “loose” fit, stonewashed finish, and a pleated waist—in other words, one particular SKU out of thousands. [SEP] How will that compare to the number who would buy the same product but with a “short” pant length? [SEP] How does a retail buyer even begin to approach the problem of making forecasts at such a minute level of detail? [SEP] The buyer might start by trying to get historical data on the weekly sales of those Levi jeans in the store. [SEP] But wait—should that be on the sales of those jeans throughout the Greater Boston area? [SEP] Should the buyer base her prediction on sales of only this particular size and style or would it be more accur	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch6.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
0.2 units, and so on. [SEP] Then the expected (average) demand is the solid black trend line shown in Figure 6.3. [SEP] The buyer could incorporate demand uncertainty into the forecast by indicating different possible values of demand, and the likelihood of that actual demand will fall within those values. [SEP] For example, in Figure 6.3, the lines directly above and below the solid trend line indicate a range of demand for which the likelihood of demand falling within that range is 50 percent. [SEP] The lines further from the trend line indicate the range with a likelihood of 90 percent. [SEP] Thus, for week 1, there is a 90 percent probability that demand will be between two units and -seventeen units, exactly as depicted in Figure 6.1. [SEP] Predicting what -customers will do when they	walk	into the store will always be challenging, but the buyer can be confident that if she stocks seventeen units at the beginning of the next week, she has a 95 percent probability of meeting all consumer demand on this product.

acclimated to it. [SEP] In a recent survey of parents whose children were enrolled in several hundred randomly chosen child-care centers across four states, over 90 percent believed that their preschoolers’ experiences were far better than experts in early childhood development judged those experiences to be.6 [SEP] Parents seemed unable to distinguish “good” from “substandard” care. [SEP] the “time bind.”  Like many parents, Angela, who raised the question of quality time, complains of being “torn in many directions.” [SEP] Often she leaves work in a hurry in the late afternoon to pick up Victor and Jeannine from child care, dashes to Victor’s tumbling class or Jeannine’s piano lesson, then stops at the grocery store to pick up something for dinner. [SEP] When Angela and her husband, Tom,	walk	through their front door, they typically head to the phone or fax machine to take care of unﬁnished work while trying to quell Victor and Jeannine’s hunger and irritability with a frozen dinner popped into the microwave and unlimited access to the TV set. [SEP] Caught in a ceaseless sprint to reconcile job, marriage, and parenting, Angela and Tom feel drained at the end of the day—too tired to grant their children more than 10 or 15 minutes of focused time. [SEP] When Victor and Jeannine do get their parents’ undivided attention, they are argumentative and unruly, compounding their parents’ fatigue and impatience. [SEP] Angela and Tom represent a growing number of American parents who try to pencil children into busy schedules, much like a business appointment.

ocultural theory, cooperative dialogues between children and more knowledgeable members of their society are necessary for children to acquire the ways of thinking and behaving that make up a community’s culture. [SEP] These dialogues occur frequently and spontaneously as adults and children spend time together—in everyday situations such as household chores, mealtimes, play, storybook reading, outings in the community, and children’s eorts to acquire all sorts of skills. [SEP] Although interactions that arise between adults and children may seem mundane and inconsequential at ﬁrst glance, sociocultural theory emphasizes that they are powerful sources of children’s learning. [SEP] Consider the following conversation between Mel and his 4-year-old son, Ben, as the pair took a summer-evening	walk	on a California beach near their home. [SEP] Mel had brought along a plastic bag, as the beach was often littered with trash after a busy day. [SEP] Ben: (running ahead and calling out) Some bottles and cans.

tex and other brain structures is necessary before children can store experiences in ways that permit them to be retrieved many years later.62 [SEP] Similarly, several psychological explanations focus on changes in the nature of memory during the preschool years—from an unconscious, automatic, and nonverbal system to one that is conscious, deliberate, and verbal.63 [SEP] Perhaps the second system cannot access events stored by the ﬁrst, making the earliest events of our lives forever irretrievable. [SEP] Yet the idea of vastly dierent approaches to remembering at young and older ages has been questioned. [SEP] Children 1 1/2 to 3 years old can describe their memories verbally.64 [SEP] And sometimes they even recall events that happened to them as preverbal infants! [SEP] For example, while	walk	ing past a distinctive house with a fenced-in front yard, 22-month-old Lisa said to her mother, “Scary doggy!” [SEP] Nine months earlier (before the child could talk), the family had taken the same	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
 art student, and the graffiti artist” (155). [SEP] A statewide meeting of Chicano mural artists was held in September of 1974 as a means of developing cooperation and communication for the artists working throughout California. [SEP] The early murals were considered public folk art because of the common themes of community and civil rights and because most of the murals were located in working-class neighborhoods and urban barrios. [SEP] Often, these early murals were referred to as a people’s art. [SEP] This concept was well expressed by a group of women artists in San Francisco who called themselves Mujeres Muralistas (women muralists). [SEP] “Our interest as artists is to put art close to where it needs to be. Close to the children; close to the old people; close to everyone who has to	walk	or ride the buses to get places. We want our art either out in the streets or in places where a lot of people go each day, the hospitals, health centers, clinics, restaurants, and other public places” (Cockcroft, Weber, and Cockcroft, 107). [SEP] The scenes of many early Chicano murals consisted of pre-Columbian indigenous themes and motifs that reflected a mestizo (mixed-race) heritage and a Mexican cultural nationalism. [SEP] Images of Aztlán, a concept from the pre--Conquest, and other Aztec symbols represented cultural pride and national loyalty. [SEP] Chicano and Chicana artists turned to symbols that portrayed the traditions of Chicanos, traditions that distinguished them from mainstream American culture. [SEP] These images can still be found in murals located in Chicano communities a	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
rth, mexicanismo and machismo are a very important part of being a pinto. [SEP] Ex-pintos are often identifiable by their mannerisms, gestures, language, haircuts, and dress. [SEP] They are usually extremely clean and well groomed, have very short hair, wear well-pressed pants, and are in excellent physical shape. [SEP] Within the prison world pintos have established a well-defined and -structured social environment, which they carry to the outside world when released. [SEP] In discussing the film American Me, Rosa Linda Fregoso states that Edward James Olmos depicts extremely well the expressive behavior of pintos both in prison and outside. [SEP] In her words, “Besides rendering a Chicano pinto presence in the rhythms of speech, Santana [the movie character] represents it in the stylized	walk	and prose of a pinto, a stance honed in the corridors behind prison walls or in the barrios of East L.A.” (1993, 130). [SEP] The pinto experience is a subculture of the Chicano experience. [SEP] Because of the low socioeconomic status of a large percentage of Chicanos in the United States and the lack of equal opportunities in education and employment, many Chicano families have been inadvertently introduced to this subculture. [SEP] A special issue of the Chicano magazine De Colores, vol. [SEP] 3, no. 1, was devoted to “Los Pintos de America,” and the issue was published as a separate monograph in 1976 by Pajarito Publications.

[SEP] At some point, some magical point, as more peaks emerge into the sunshine, quite suddenly, a hiker can	walk	all the way across the Alps in the sunshine. [SEP] This is a phase transition from the isolated peaks regime. [SEP] A connected web  mathematically, a percolating web  of connected “solutions” has emerged suddenly as the fog lowers. [SEP] Now consider hikers striding across the Alps, knapsacks and hearts full. [SEP] If plate tectonics rather slowly deforms the landscape, then whenever hikers are about to be dipped into the lethal bromine fog, they can take a sideways step in some direction and remain in the sunshine.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
ur job shop problem, a fixed fraction, P, of the steps in the construction of each of the O objects were jointly permutable. [SEP] As P increases and more steps are permutable, the conflicting constraints in the total problem are reduced. [SEP] But this in turn means that the entire space of solutions improves, that is, the entire space shifts toward lower makespan, or higher eciency. [SEP] And now the relation to the bromine fog metaphor can be stated clearly. [SEP] As the number of permutable steps increases, the conflicting constraints are reduced. [SEP] The entire makespan-eciency landscape is lifted higher, the peaks are higher, and the landscape, with fewer conflicting constraints, is smoother. [SEP] All in all, the result is that the percolating web of solutions where the hikers can	walk	all across the Alps occurs at a higher eciency and shorter makespan. [SEP] In terms of Figure . [SEP] , the capacity to permute steps in the job shop problem shifts the phase transition point leftward, toward shorter makespan. [SEP] Equivalently, if one wants to shift the curve in Figure . [SEP] to the left, purchase a computable number of machines that are polyfunctional so that the same machine can be used for more than one job. [SEP] That too reduces conflicting constraints.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1

The flower-lined road from Loulé to São Brás de Alportel, another market town and site of one of only two government pousadas (inns) along the Algarve, passes through rolling orchards of fig, olive, and orange trees. [SEP] It’s best to visit the town on Saturday, when the lively market transforms its otherwise sleepy character. [SEP] You may wish to pay a visit to the charming Museu Etnográfico do Trajo Algárvio (Museum of Algarvian Costumes), where exhibits of local dress are well staged in a large, old house 90 m (100 yards) or so off the main square. [SEP] In this northern part of the southern province, life is visibly slower and more rustic; bonneted ladies in black	walk	along the roadside, old men bounce up and down on donkeys, and families pluck almonds from the trees with long sticks. [SEP] On the road toward Faro is a pair of historical sights. [SEP] The Palácio de Estói is a most curious find. [SEP] The charming Rococo palace, found through a small side gate just to the left of the church steps in the town center, once belonged to the Dukes of Estói. [SEP] Begun in the mid-18th century, in palatial terms, it’s rather small, abandoned and visibly dilapidated, and only the gardens are open to the public. [SEP] Yet it is a spectacular sight. [SEP] Its faded glory includes balustrade terraces and staircases with splendid bursts of bougainvillea, busts of historic characters impaled on the parapets, brightly colored wall tiles, and formal gardens. [SEP] The	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
ia (Church of Mercy), a spectacular Renaissance edifice. [SEP] The carved portico is especially fine, with a statue of Our Lady of Mercy under a canopy. [SEP] The 18th-century interior contains excellent specimens of carved retables and tiles. [SEP] There are at least two dozen other churches in Tavira; also worth a visit — though you may find them closed‚ — are the 13th-century Igreja de Santiago (St. James Church), near the castle walls, and the 17th-century Igreja de Sao Paulo (Church of St. Paul), across the river on Praça Dr. Padinha. [SEP] The church, part of a former monastery, has a unique feature: the floor of the transept is paved with bricks and stones painted with Spanish figures. [SEP] Rua da Liberdade, Tavira’s main street, is lined with stately 16th-century mansions. [SEP] A	walk	down any of the city’s old streets will reveal handsome details of noble houses, such as double windows and latticed doors. [SEP] A lively fruit and vegetable market is held by the banks of the River Gilão, and it is well worth crossing the Roman bridge to view more of the town’s elegant houses and pretty flower-filled squares. [SEP] Many of those houses have sloping triangular roofs, called tesouros (treasures). [SEP] A nice excursion from Tavira is to the nearby island Ilha de Tavira, where there is a huge and thoroughly appealing beach backed by sand dunes. [SEP] Jetties leave from a point, Quatro Águas, a couple of km (one mile) east of town.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
The town square, Praça do Marquês do Pombal, is the work of the royal architect, and the tour de force of Vila Real. [SEP] The pavement’s black and white wedges of stone radiate from an obelisk in the center of the square like rays from the sun. [SEP] Distinguished three-story, late 18th-century houses line the square, and orange trees soften the edges, adding color and scent. [SEP] Visit the small Manuel Cabanas Museum, just off the square, to see a nice collection of woodcuts that ranges from rustic scenes to famous statesmen and composers. [SEP] Today Vila Real is sleepy but quietly dignified. [SEP] A	walk	around the old quarter reveals a number of fine, brightly painted houses along pedestrian-only streets. [SEP] Vila Real de Santo António’s main appeal is as the ferry port to Ayamonte across the water in Spain. [SEP] The trip takes just 20 minutes — less time than it would take to drive to and over the new bridge — and the white town of Ayamonte is a fine sight as you approach it from the river. [SEP] Crossing into Spain, you will need to take your passport. [SEP] Excursion to Lisbon	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Perched on the edge of the Bairro Alto is the Igreja do Carmo, devastated in the earthquake of 1755 but deliberately preserved as an atmospheric ruin and potent reminder of its impact. [SEP] Nearby, the sumptuous, 16th-century Igreja de São Roque, features a small museum of sacred art. [SEP] You can	walk	to this area easily from the central squares, but it’s also fun to go by tram or instead to board the landmark 30-meter (98-foot) Elevador de Santa Justa, which you’ll find just off the Rossio square in the Baixa, the lower city. [SEP] This 1902 Victorian marvel of iron and glass was built by Raul Mesnier. [SEP] The longer, slower way back downhill meanders through the upmarket shopping area of Chiado, now totally rebuilt after a 1988 fire that swept through the district. [SEP] The Baixa is Lisbon’s principal business district. [SEP] The main square is the Praça Dom Pedro IV, better known as the Rossio. [SEP] Look out for the railway station, Estação do Rossio, which looks like a Moorish palace with horseshoe arches, just west of the square. [SEP] Two blocks north is another lively square, 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
he Alteration in 1578 Catholics were not permitted to practice their religion, and Hartman — along with a number of other wealthy Catholics of the time — had a secret chapel built, where his family and friends could worship. [SEP] Although they were common at the time, this is now the only secret chapel left in the city, and because of its location in the house is called “Our Lord in the Attic” or Ons’ Lieve Heer op Solder. [SEP] Over its years of use as a church, three surrounding houses were added to create extra space, and several of the other rooms are furnished in authentic 18th-century style. [SEP] It is a fascinating glimpse of a very difficult time in Amsterdam’s history, but it’s not just a museum piece — the church is still used for weddings. [SEP] Southeast of Oude Kerk you will	walk	through the small Chinese Quarter to reach Waag. [SEP] This is one of the oldest buildings in the city and was opened in 1488 as a city gate, marking the eastern boundary of the city along the new wall built after the disastrous fire in the 1450s. [SEP] The numerous turrets and rounded tower give it the look of a fairytale castle but it has had a more colorful history. [SEP] Public executions were held here in the 16th century with the condemned being kept in a small cell on the ground floor before they met their fate. [SEP] From the early 17th century it became the weigh house (the name Waaggebouw means “weigh house”) for cargoes entering or leaving the city down the Geldersekade Canal to its north. [SEP] The upper-floor rooms were taken by various trades’ guilds for their meetings, and fo	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
In the early 19th century the weigh house closed and Waag had a number of less illustrious tenants; it even spent some time as a furniture store. [SEP] It now houses a café/bar, so you can have a refreshment and admire the impressive Gothic interior at the same time. [SEP] Nieuwmarkt (New Market) surrounds the Waag and it is home to several different types of market throughout the week. [SEP] If you	walk	to the north side of the Waag and look up the Gelderskade you will see a tower dominating the skyline. [SEP] This is Schreierstoren, also part of the new city wall of 1480. [SEP] City scholars are divided as to the reason for the tower’s name. [SEP] Some say it comes from the word schreien which means “weeping” as it was a place where sailors’ weeping wives came to wave their men off to sea. [SEP] Other say that the name is a derivation of scherpe, which means “sharp” — denoting the towers position on a 90-degree bend in the wall.

atue of Johan Rudolf Thorbecke who designed the Dutch constitution in 1848. [SEP] Wander through the square, which hosts an art market on Sundays, to reach Rembrandtsplein, one of the city’s most vibrant social centers. [SEP] Before 1878 this square was called Botermarkt, (a butter market was held here in the 19th century) but the square was renamed after the large statue of Rembrandt was sited here. [SEP] One wonders what he would have made of the square, for since the statue was unveiled, it has attracted theaters, cinemas, clubs, and show halls, along with a plethora of bars and restaurants and a curtain of vibrant neon signs all around the façade. [SEP] On a summer evening it is one of the best places to sit with a drink and watch the world go by, and is within easy reach of a romantic	walk	along the canalsides. [SEP] Beyond the eastern end of Waterlooplein you will see the Visserplein, busy with several lanes of traffic. [SEP] Head across the square to Weesperstraat to find the Joods Historisch Museum (Jewish Historical Museum) which documents the history of the once large and influential Jewish community in the city. [SEP] Jewish history dates back to the late 16th century, but was cut short by the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam in 1940. [SEP] The systematic deportation of the Jewish population to concentration camps destroyed the community and after the war only a handful of the thousands forced to leave returned to their homes.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
The Botanical Gardens have a long and illustrious history. [SEP] They began as a small medicinal garden in 1682, but soon became the depository for many of the new plant species brought from Dutch colonies in the Golden Age and were responsible for developing each genus for cultivation, propagation and commercial exploitation. [SEP] The distinctive glass houses were added in 1912, and today the gardens have one of the largest collections in the world. [SEP] A two-minute	walk	down Plantage Middenlaan (Plantage Middle Road) leads you to Artis, a fascinating complex of zoo, aquarium, planetarium, and Geological Museum which aims to increase your knowledge of the physical world. [SEP] The zoo was one of the first in Europe when it opened its doors in 1838, and it has continued as a groundbreaking institution, now acting as a center for efforts to save several endangered species of animals. [SEP] Many of the old and confined Victorian enclosures where the animals were kept have been redeveloped in the 1990s to create more fitting environments for their majestic and healthy-looking animals. [SEP] The Planetarium and other areas of Artis offer fun ways to learn about the world around us and are entertaining for adults and children alike.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Some inhabitants get a bird’s eye view of Artis zoo — imagine looking out of your apartment window on a rainy Amsterdam day and seeing a small herd of grazing zebra. [SEP] Walk north through Entrepodok and you will reach the main route of Prinse Henrikkade which runs along the northern edge of the city (this would lead you back to central station if you turned left). [SEP] Cross the bridge of the Nieuwe Vaart canal and	walk	towards a large square building with a masted sail ship docked outside. [SEP] This is The Scheepvaartmuseum (The National Maritime Museum). [SEP] As you cross the bridge, look left for a glimpse of the only windmill left in the city’s central area. [SEP] The De Gooyer windmill was built in the early part of the 18th century to grind corn. [SEP] The building housing The Scheepvaartmuseum was built in 1656 for the Dutch navy. [SEP] Its strong walls safeguarded a vast arsenal used to protect Dutch interests around the known world. [SEP] Today its extensive exhibits document the long and illustrious history of maritime achievement by the Dutch, with paintings, maps, and maritime models explaining the part that ships — and particularly the VOC — played in the growth of the empire in the 17th cen	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] Today its 46 hectares (120 acres) have grazing farm animals, flocks of parakeets, jogging tracks, and cycle paths. [SEP] It is the perfect place for a picnic on a summer’s day. [SEP] The large pavilion, which opened in 1881, was restored and refurbished in 1991 and reopened as the Nederlands Filmmuseum. [SEP] It now shows more than 1000 films each year including many outdoor screenings and other artistic performances in the summer. [SEP] Only five minutes to the south of Leidseplein is the museum quarter, for many visitors the raison d’être for their visit to Amsterdam. [SEP] Here, three of the most important art collections in Europe sit side by side, allowing visitors to	walk	from one to the next in a matter of moments. [SEP] Although all very different in appearance, they are brought together by an open space which has recently been redesigned and replanted to accent the buildings. [SEP] The square is called, not surprisingly, Museumplein. [SEP] The Rijksmuseum	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
 exhausted after your “museum-fest,” then the streets around the Museumplein offer some exciting retail therapy. [SEP] Walk across Paulus Potterstraat from the Van Gogh Museum and you will find Coster Diamonds, one of the oldest “houses” in the city, where you can watch diamonds being polished and maybe buy a carat or two. [SEP] Van Baerlstraat, bordering the west side of Museumplein, is the haute couture area of the city. [SEP] For further culture of a musical nature the Concertgebouw on Van Bearlstraat is home to the orchestra of the same name. [SEP] The main auditorium is considered to have almost perfect acoustics even though the designer of the building, Van Gendt, had no experience in this specialized area. [SEP] If you want to stroll back to town after your visit to the museums then	walk	through the open courtyard which cuts through the center of the Rijksmuseum, across Stadouderskade and on to the narrow street of Nieuwe Speigalstraat. [SEP] This center of antique and art galleries has some wonderful windows to gaze into. [SEP] Prices are said to be on the high side, but the dealers are some of the most experienced in the world and they are sure to give you good advice. [SEP] Walk north along the whole length of Nieuwe Speigalstraat and you will eventually reach Herengracht at its most spectacular point. [SEP] When it was first dug, and the lots of land sold, it was soon realized that this section of the canal (between Vijzelstraat and Leidsestraat) would have the largest houses inhabited by the richest families in the city. [SEP] For this reason it has become known as the	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
ation, although it was only open to well-to-do orphans; the poor had to fend for themselves. [SEP] Extended several times, including a wing designed by de Keyser, it was opened as the Amsterdam Historical Museum in 1975 and its rooms reveal the details of the development of this fascinating city. [SEP] You’ll see plans, maps, and paintings depicting the streets and canals as they were when just completed. [SEP] The Golden Age is brought to life (rooms 5–15) but there is also an interesting section on 20th-century Amsterdam, the Nazi occupation, and efforts to protect and preserve the city. [SEP] Tiny details, such as the relief above the Kalverstraat entrance which asks people to support the upkeep of the orphanage, also point to the museum’s original purpose. [SEP] Once out of the museum,	walk	north. [SEP] Take Kalverstraat, or if you find it a little too busy for comfort, take Rokin which runs parallel to Kalverstraat to the right. [SEP] This wide street was once also a canal, which was drained and filled in to allow better access for modern forms of transport. [SEP] On the far side of the canal you will see the elegant Georgian façade of the Allard Pierson Museum, the archaeological collection for the city. [SEP] Another couple of minutes strolling will bring you to Dam Square (simply called Dam by Amsterdammers), the symbolic heart of the city. [SEP] Dam is a wide cobbled square, usually filled with people and pigeons, and dominated by the ornate façade of the Koninklijk Paleis (Royal Palace) which dates from 1655. [SEP] It was originally built as the Town Hall, facing the lan	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Just 5 km (2.75 miles) beyond Monnickendam is the community of Marken, one of the most beautiful villages in the Netherlands and home to a community of Calvinist Dutch whose traditions reach back hundreds of years. [SEP] The older inhabitants of this close-knit community still wear traditional Dutch costume as everyday wear. [SEP] Until 1957 the village was situated on an island, remote from the outside world. [SEP] The opening of a roadway linking the village to the mainland brought many changes for the inhabitants. [SEP] Today Marken welcomes visitors but not their cars, which must be left in a large car park on the outskirts. [SEP] You can	walk	through the village with its traditional painted wooden houses to the picture-perfect port. [SEP] Stop at the tiny museum on the quayside, which holds an eclectic mix of seafaring and fishing memorabilia. [SEP] Traveling from Monnickendam to Marken, the road leads out into open water, home to hundreds of thousands of birds in the summer. [SEP] The native herons, ducks, and moorhens see many species of migratory birds who fly north for the summer and return south as winter approaches. [SEP] The road also makes for good cycling, being flat and smooth, or for	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Eventually it was used as a powder magazine. [SEP] In September 1687 Venetian forces threatened Athens and one of their mortars hit the Parthenon, igniting the powder inside. [SEP] The resulting explosion badly damaged the structure and many other ancient buildings on the site. [SEP] The center of the Parthenon was totally destroyed along with many columns and priceless carved friezes. [SEP] Subsequent “licences” granted by the Ottomans to European nobles saw many prize friezes disappear to archaeological collections around Europe, including the Elgin marbles (ornately carved pediments) that were taken to London by Lord Elgin. [SEP] Restoration of the temple has been almost constant since 1834. [SEP] Today it is not possible to	walk	among the columns and through what remains of the inner temple. [SEP] This echoes the rules of ancient Greece, when only the highest priests could enter the cella. [SEP] There they would be able to worship an ivory-and- gold-covered wooden statue of Athena said to be 12 m (39 ft) high which has long since been lost. [SEP] Walk around the 70 m (228 ft) by 30 m (101 ft) exterior to really appreciate the grace of the columns. [SEP] There are no straight lines anywhere in the building — the graduated curves simply create the illusion of the vertical and horizontal. [SEP] To the north of the Parthenon stand the graceful statues of the Porch of the Caryatids, which adorn the southern façade of the Erechtheíon. [SEP] This temple is an unusual mélange of architectural styles, with rooms at varying 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] These long porches or porticos provided shade in summer and shelter in winter and they were often used to link important community buildings. [SEP] The Stoa of Attalos was a two-story construction with rooms at the back that housed small shops. [SEP] Today it is home to the Agora Museum and displays numerous artifacts found at this extensive sight. [SEP] Here you’ll find a range of everyday objects not seen in the Acropolis Museum, in addition to religious and civic statuary and mosaics. [SEP] The route of the great “sacred way” that linked the Agora with the Acropolis above — and that was used during the Panathenaic Festival — is now being excavated and rebuilt to allow visitors to	walk	in the footsteps of the ancient Athenians.

[SEP] A small square cuts its path just a little way from Monastiráki Square, and it is decorated with the beautiful Byzantine church of Kapnikaréa, the official church of Athens University. [SEP] Built in the 11th century its dome is supported by four Roman columns and its modern frescoes were created in the 1950s by Fotis Kondoglou. [SEP] Kapnikaréa was earmarked for demolition in the 1830s but was saved by the personal intervention of Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, father of Greece’s first king. [SEP] We’ll take the route west from Monastiráki Square, as if leaving the city. [SEP] This leads us one kilometer (.62 miles) to the archaeological site of Kerameikós. [SEP] As you	walk	along, immediately to the north of Ermou (on your right) is the district of Psirí. [SEP] Unspoiled by tourism, there is a very Greek atmosphere in the maze of narrow streets and some excellent tavernas among its traditional shops. [SEP] The excavated area of Kerameikós is interesting because it incorporates a section of the 478 b.c. city wall and the ceremonial entranceways into Athens from the cities of Eleusis to the west and Piraeus to the south. [SEP] The Panathenian Festival Procession would start from here on its journey to the Acropolis, and the procession of the Eleusian Mysteries would leave from here through the Sacred Gate and along the Sacred Way.

The simple, rounded female figures were funerary or religious objects and are in total contrast to the intricate pediment and frieze carvings and religious statuary found at temples on the Acropolis and in the Acropolis Museum. [SEP] You’ll also see a rare male figure among the collection, and the beautiful Harp Player — a more complex carving in the same style. [SEP] Rooms 7–35 concentrate on sculpture — perhaps the greatest collection of ancient sculpture in the world — and these are displayed to show the chronological development of the art form. [SEP] Simply styled male and female figures (kouros and kore) of the Achaiac Age (seventh–fifth century b.c.) give way to more ornate and literal human forms as you	walk	through the collection into the Classical Age and then on to the Hellenistic and Roman eras. [SEP] Greek gods are popular themes, followed by eminent human figures of Roman times. [SEP] Room 7 holds the important early statue of Artemis by Nikandre of Naxos (c640 b.c.). [SEP] Room 15 is dominated by a fine statue of Poseidon in bronze (460 b.c.) found in the sea off the island of Euboea. [SEP] The god is set to launch his trident against foes unknown. [SEP] The Hall of the Stairs hosts another statue dredged from the sea, that of the Jockey of the Artemision. [SEP] The diminutive jockey drives on the handsome steed which has its two front legs raised into the air, as if about to leap over an invisible obstacle.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Behind Evangelismos Metro statio, and next door to the Hilton Hotel is the National Gallery. [SEP] The original compilation was boosted in the 1880s by a large bequest by art collector Aléxandros Soútzos, but the two collections were only brought together in this gallery in 1976. [SEP] Much of the permanent collection comprises 19th- and 20th-century Greek art and post-Byzantine icons, though you can also find works by El Greco, Picasso, and Delacroix.

Lycabettus and Kolonaki To the west of the bare sheer rock of the Acropolis is a rival hill — the verdant pine-clad Lycabettus, which makes an inviting diversion from the archaeological sites of the city. [SEP] Here you’ll be able to sit in shade and listen to the birds. [SEP] The hill was never settled in ancient times because there was no water supply. [SEP] You can reach the upper slopes by funicular. [SEP] When you reach the top station,	walk	to the small chapels of Ayios Isidoros and Ayios Georgios — center of the Easter celebrations for the city — a modern amphitheater for summer performances, and wonderful views across Athens where major attractions are pointed out on marble panoramas. [SEP] Though there are fixed telescopes here, having your own binoculars is a boon to really take in the detail. [SEP] Surrounding the lower slopes of Lycabettus on the south and west sides is Kolonaki, perhaps the most fashionable district of central Athens. [SEP] Apartments and houses here are much sought after as they sit among chic boutiques, designer stores, restaurants, and bars. [SEP] It is one of the best parts of the city to eat out in the evening with a range of good international eateries in addition to traditional Greek tavernas.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
North from Zea harbor is another pretty harbor, Mikrolimani (Small Harbor) or Tourkolimani, where you’ll find the fishing fleet and some good fish tavernas.

[SEP] Pride of place goes to the Piraeus Kouros, the oldest full-size bronze figure depicting the god Apollo. [SEP] On the grounds of the museum are scant remains of the ancient Theater of Zea. [SEP] Walking further south along the promenade past remnants of the ancient sea wall brings you to another small bay where you will find the Hellenic Maritime Museum, a semicircular museum with small garden in front complete with cannon.

t decorate the interior, particularly that of Christ Pantocrator in the main dome. [SEP] Through this same industrial area runs the Sacred Way that linked Athens with the city of Eleusis. [SEP] In ancient times the way was lined with shrines and tombs, which are now and again brought to light when redevelopment takes place. [SEP] Eleusis was home to the Sanctuary of Demeter and the Eleusian Mysteries — a series of complex and enigmatic rituals only performed by initiates of the order. [SEP] The order thrived from the Mycenaean era to the coming of Christianity. [SEP] Annual celebrations to Demeter took place in Athens each September, with a public festival and a secret religious rite that transformed chosen followers into initiates of the secrets. [SEP] A procession would leave Eleusis and	walk	along the Sacred Way entering Athens via the Sacred Gate at Kerameikos (see page 49) before proceeding to the Acropolis. [SEP] In Eleusis the sacred way led directly to the Sanctuary of Demeter and a large Temple of Artemis with a forecourt where the initiates would gather in preparation for the procession. [SEP] A great Propylaia marked the entrance to the town  — a copy of that at the Acropolis. [SEP] The Precinct of Demeter lay in a walled complex, and its inner sanctum, the Periklean Telesterion, where only initiates were allowed to enter, sat within the temple. [SEP] You will also find the remains of more mundane structures such as the Bouleuterion and gymnasium. [SEP] A museum on site displays extremely good artifacts found among the ruins.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Vendue House, at the western end of Bay Street, at the corner of George Street, was once the site of the Nassau slave auction. [SEP] It now houses the Pompey Museum of Slavery and Emancipation. [SEP] The pale pink stone house is unassuming, but the interior tells of the plight of slaves on the islands and of the positive work that was undertaken in the years following emancipation. [SEP] The Pirates of Nassau attraction at the corner of George and Marlborough Streets brings to life the dramatic and exciting world of the pirates. [SEP] The building itself dates from the 18th century; the attraction inside recreates the Nassau quayside of the 17th century. [SEP] A three-quarter-size French corvette ship and quayside buildings have been stunningly brought to life. [SEP] As you	walk	along the “dock,” costumed staff act out the roles of shipmate and pirate and regale you with tales of their everyday lives and deeds. [SEP] Visitors then step inside the 75-ft- (23-m-) long vessel to examine the paraphernalia of the pirate’s trade that line the corridors and decks. [SEP] Treasure chests mix with rum casks, and pirates tell of their lives at sea in the lonely and dangerous times.

[SEP] The hotels here have all the luxuries you could ever need, yet you might feel as if you’re a million miles away from the worries of the world. [SEP] The cay is small enough to explore on foot but most people choose to rent a golf cart or bicycle (your hotel can make the arrangements). [SEP] New Plymouth is the largest town on the cay. [SEP] It really has only one main route, Parliament Street, which is full of trim and brightly painted wooden homes with picket fences. [SEP] As you	walk	down the street you’ll hear the sounds of daily activity floating through the open windows, occasionally a radio station with news, or maybe evangelical songs. [SEP] You can browse in the general stores and souvenir shops or visit one of the small art galleries that sell original works and prints by local artists.

[SEP] A number of souvenir shops in the houses have some interesting Bahamian and European gifts. [SEP] The beautiful pink sand beach on the Atlantic side of the island is also a big draw. [SEP] The five miles of sand are a beautiful sight, especially in the early morning or just before sunset when the color reflects more deeply. [SEP] Any of the several luxury hotels tucked just behind the dunes make a good base for the beach or the delights of the town, only a few minutes’	walk	away.

[SEP] Though you can’t go wrong anywhere on the western coast. [SEP] Mount Alvernia, in the center of the island, is not far from the airfield at New Bight. [SEP] This settlement originally served as a hermitage for Father Jerome, an Anglican missionary who had converted to Catholicism and become an influential churchman on the Out Islands, responsible for the erection of a number of Catholic Churches. [SEP] Father Jerome built a small Hermitage on the heights of Mount Alvernia that you’ll see as you reach the summit (a 15-minute	walk	from a rudimentary car park); the missionary was buried in a small hilltop cave here upon his death in 1956 at the age of 80.

In atmosphere, Sanur falls somewhere between the brash, noisy Kuta and secluded, pricey Nusa Dua.

[SEP] At sunset, the fishermen prepare for a night’s work aided by batteries of lights on the boats to attract their catch, while local farmers herd their goats or lead their water buffaloes along the sand. [SEP] If you’re lucky, you may be around to see the races between beautifully decorated pairs of water buffaloes pulling a sled around a track in the fields. [SEP] Ask if any are scheduled: They follow the Balinese calendar.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
A rough and narrow road from the middle of Bayan ascends rapidly to Batu Koq, and then continues to nearby Senaru, where it ends. [SEP] Those wanting to go farther have to	walk	. [SEP] The original tiny village has traditional Sasak houses on stilts, surrounded by a wooden fence. [SEP] Some of the locals have opened homestays along the road, a few with a warung attached. [SEP] Guides and porters can be hired by the day, and you can buy basic food and rent camping gear, including tents. [SEP] Take water-purifying tablets, warm clothes, and arrange for a small camping stove. [SEP] The main objective of most trekkers is the awesome crater with its big C-shaped lake.

East of Narmada, near the main road that runs through Lombok, there is a cluster of craft villages. [SEP] The baskets and tablemats from Loyok are famous throughout Indonesia. [SEP] In neighboring Rungkang, they make smooth jet-black pots of all sizes and then weave a fine basket to fit tightly around them, using supple lengths of ultra-thin rattan. [SEP] On the southern slopes of Gunung Rinjani, Tete Batu is a favorite local retreat, with an old hotel and a couple of homestays. [SEP] Here you can	walk	to forest waterfalls, while the black monkeys chatter, squeal, and swing in the trees. [SEP] Labuhan Lombok is a hot, windswept, dusty, end-of-the-world sort of spot, in spite of its picturesque stilt houses. [SEP] From here, ferries laden with cars, motorbikes, and passengers sail several times a day eastward to the island of Sumbawa from a terminal 3 km (2 miles) from the village.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
eeses and embutidos (Spanish hams, sausages and other cold cuts). [SEP] El Xampanet (Montcada, [SEP] 22) is an immensely popular cava bar always full of chatty locals. [SEP] Schilling (Ferran, [SEP] 23) draws a smoky European crowd of late-night smokers. [SEP] Boadas (c/ dels Taller, 1) is a cocktail bar that looks like a movie set for a shoot of 1940s Havana. [SEP] Bar London (c/ Nou de la Rambla, 34) is a rough-and-tumble place with occasional live jazz and rock. [SEP] In a gorgeous medieval palace at c/ Montcada, 20, Espai Barroc is a sumptuous, pricey bar that looks like something out of The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, the Peter Greenaway film. [SEP] Two of the hottest bar scenes are El Born, near Santa María del Mar, and the Port Olímpic near the Hotel Arts. [SEP] You can’t	walk	without tripping into a cocktail. [SEP] A young, hip crowd flocks to chic “design bars” for drinks and dancing. [SEP] Nick Havana (c/ Rosselló, 208) was one of the pioneers of the design bar genre. [SEP] Torres de Ávila, within the Poble Espanyol on Montjuïc, is even more extreme, an adventurous fantasy playground designed by Javier Mariscal, one of the hottest designers of late.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
El Molino (Vila i Vila, 99) is one of Barcelona’s oldest cabarets. [SEP] Cabaret of the distinctly kitschy kind is the nightly rule at Bodega Bohemia (Lancaster, 2), on the west side of La Rambla. [SEP] Live jazz most nights of the week can be found at Harlem Jazz Club in the Gothic Quarter (c/ Comtessa de Sobradiel, 8), probably the city’s best jazz club. [SEP] For live flamenco or pop flamenco, head to Los Tarantos, or for jazz, to Jamboree, both on the Plaça Reial. [SEP] Luz de Gas (Muntaner, 246) and Otto Zutz (Lincoln, 15) continue to be the reigning dance clubs, which don’t get going until well after midnight. [SEP] The latest in modern dance, music, and experimental theater is regularly staged in the evenings at the Mercat de les Flors, the old flower market a short	walk	from the spectacular sound-and-light show of the Font Màgica (see page 68). [SEP] If you’re lucky enough to be in the city during a festival—either a religious or secular holiday—you’ll see the city’s different neighborhoods erupt into a carnival. [SEP] Food, fireworks, music, costumes, and especially the huge papier-mâché effigies called gégants (giants) and their comical companions, the cabezudos (bigheads), are essential fiesta features. [SEP] Each neighborhood has its own identifying models. [SEP] The gégants are about 4 meters (13 feet) high and elaborately dressed as kings and queens, knights, ladies, gentlemen, and country folk. [SEP] Cabezudos, meanwhile, are usually oversize cartoon heads of well-known personalities or types.

just before the lunch hour and in the early evening on weekdays and at dusk on weekends, though it is never deserted. [SEP] In the wee, wee hours it’s populated by a sometimes motley mix of early-morning newspaper sellers, streetsweepers, and bar hounds stumbling back to their apartments and hotels. [SEP] The broad, tree-shaded, and pedestrian-only promenade stretches nearly 2 km (1 mile) down a gentle incline from the city’s hub, Plaça de Catalunya (see page 54), to the waterfront. [SEP] La Rambla takes its name from an Arabic word meaning a sandy, dry river bed. [SEP] It was a shallow gully until the 14th century, when Barcelona families began to construct homes nearby. [SEP] As the area became more populated, the stream was soon paved over. [SEP] To the north of Las Ramblas (left as you	walk	down it) is the old city, Ciutat Vella; to the south, or right, is El Raval. [SEP] The five sections of La Rambla change in character, as they do in name, as you stroll along. [SEP] The short Rambla de Canaletes at the top is where crowds pour in from the Plaça de Catalunya or emerge from the metro and train stations beneath. [SEP] On Sundays and Mondays in season you’ll find rambunctious knots of fans replaying the games of Barça, the popular name for Barcelona’s beloved football (soccer) club Barcelona F.C.; if an important match has just been won, look out. [SEP] Elderly denizens relax on metal chairs (for which you are supposed to pay) and watch the passing parade.

The leafy cloister is a lively refuge, with birds fluttering among the orange, magnolia, and palm trees that entirely fill its center. [SEP] Watch where you	walk	, as the cloister is paved with tombstones, badly worn, but many still bearing the emblems of the bootmakers, tailors, and other craft guilds whose wealth helped pay for the cathedral. [SEP] From the cloister, pass to the Capella de Santa Llúcia, a chapel with 13th- and 14th-century tombstones on the floor and a monument to a crusader knight in armor on one wall. [SEP] Leaving the chapel by its front entrance, turn left at carrer del Bisbe Irurita.

Nearby is the Baixada de Santa Eulàlia. [SEP] Just off the street is Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, a tiny and silent square closed to traffic (silent except when the nearby school holds recess here). [SEP] The saint’s church was pockmarked by Italian bombs during the Civil War, though others maintain that firing squads performed executions here. [SEP] The Baixada de Santa Eulàlia descends to carrer dels Banys Nous, named for the long-gone “new” baths of the ghetto erected in the 12th century. [SEP] This winding street, which more or less follows the line of the old Roman wall, is the unofficial boundary of the Barri Gòtic. [SEP] It is also known as the carrer dels antiquaris — the headquarters of antiques dealers. [SEP] As you	walk	along, keep your eyes peeled for unusual hand-painted shop signs, the fretwork of Gothic windows, and dusty treasures in the antiques shop windows. [SEP] You’ll see the old tile signs with a cart symbol high in the walls at some corners, the indication of one-way streets. [SEP] Around the corner is a trio of impossibly pretty plazas. [SEP] Plaça de Sant Josep Oriol adjoins Plaça del Pi, on which sits Santa María del Pi, a handsome church with a tall octagonal bell tower and a harmonious façade pierced by a large 15th-century rose window. [SEP] “Pi” means pine tree, and there is a small specimen here replacing one that was a landmark in past centuries.

On the west side is a modern sculptural interpretation, much criticized, that has galvanized those who believed the temple should have been left as it was, unfinished, as a tribute to the great Gaudí. [SEP] Nevertheless, onward it goes  — when it will be finished, nobody knows. [SEP] For now and perhaps the generation to come, the great spires are marred by ever-present scaffolding and cranes. [SEP] A short	walk	diagonally from La Sagrada Familia is the astonishing Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, designed by Domènech i Montaner (architect of the Palau de la Música Catalana) and completed by his son. [SEP] The complex of buildings — still a working hospital — is one of modernisme’s most underrated (and least known) achievements. [SEP] Farther north, in a working class neighborhood on the rising slope of the hills behind Gràcia, Parc Guëll, another wildly ambitious Gaudí project, is a residential community completely intertwined with nature. [SEP] Although this project too was never completed according to plan, it is a marvelous place to visit: part park, part Hansel-and-Gretel fantasyland. [SEP] Gaudí’s patron Eusebi Güell bought 6 hectares (15 acres) here, overlooking the city and the sea, in	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Waterfront & Barceloneta Barcelona turned its back on the sea in the 19th century and focused on developing industry. [SEP] The sea wall where families loved to	walk	and catch the breeze on stifling summer nights was dismantled. [SEP] Access to and even a view of the sea was obstructed by warehouses and railway tracks. [SEP] Expansion proceeded towards the hills, and La Barceloneta, a neighborhood created in the mid-1700s between the port and the beach, became the district of modest fishermen and sailors. [SEP] Now all this has changed again, and a recreational (and increasingly commercial) area has been newly created along the waterfront. [SEP] Begin a tour of the waterfront at the Columbus Monument, at the foot of the Ramblas. [SEP] To the right is Les Reials Drassanes, begun in 1255, the only medieval shipyard still in existence and now the Museu Marítim (Maritime Museum).

ents, it has blossomed into a vibrant seaside neighborhood for young families and professionals. [SEP] Tourist interest focuses on the Port Olímpic, the new port, a lively area of restaurants and bars clustered around anchored boats and yachts, the stretch of landscaped beaches called Platjas de Barcelona, and the shopping centered around the deluxe high-rise Hotel Arts, which sits imposingly on the beach. [SEP] You can either take a bus or the metro to La Barceloneta from Plaça de Catalunya. [SEP] A sensational ride back is aboard an aerial cable car ride that traverses the length of the port, providing excellent views of the waterfront and La Rambla. [SEP] The ride climbs to the cable-car tower Torre de Jaume I, 107 meters (351 feet) above the harbor. [SEP] From there you can descend and	walk	back to the Columbus monument area, or continue the aerial lift to Montjuïc at the level of the amusement park. [SEP] Lodged between Port Olímpic and the La Ribera district is Parc de la Ciutadella, the city’s largest park. [SEP] The expanse contains the city zoo (Parc Zoológic and its rare albino gorilla named Snowflake, or Copito de Nieve), the Museu d’Art Modern (Modern Art Museum), the seat of the Parlament de Catalunya, and the foundations of Ciutadella (Citadel). [SEP] It’s a lovely park, with a lake, large old trees, and pleasant pathways. [SEP] The large Baroque fountain, La Cascada, was designed by Josep Fontseré, who had as his assistant a young architecture student named Antoni Gaudí.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
EP] The exhibits follow Miró’s artistic development from 1914 onwards. [SEP] Photographs show him always neatly dressed and barbered, looking like a Catalan businessman in contrast to the more bohemian Picasso, and in contrast, too, with the surrealist works he created. [SEP] The collection is witty and bright with the bright colors and unique language symbols associated with the artist. [SEP] The Avinguda de Miramar continues past the station of the funicular railway that climbs the hill from the Avinguda del Paral.lel near the Paral.lel metro stop. [SEP] The funicular links up here with a cable car that goes to the Parc d’Atraccions de Montjuïc, an amusement park, and on to the Castell de Montjuïc on the summit. [SEP] Cable cars run daily in summer, weekends-only in winter. [SEP] A short	walk	from the amusement park is the Plaça de l’Armada station for the cable car that crosses the harbor, completing an interesting network of transport by cable. [SEP] The fortress atop Montjuïc, built in 1640, remained in use by the army and then as a prison until shortly before it was turned over to the city to become a museum in 1960. [SEP] The Museu Militar (Military Museum) has an extensive collection of antique weaponry and armor, lead soldiers of different epochs, and models of Catalan castles. [SEP] Here in a basement room you’ll find what may be the only statue of Generalíssimo Francisco Franco to be seen in Barcelona today.

South Beijing Few tourists venture into the Xuanwu and Chongwen districts south of Chang’an Avenue and Tiananmen Square except to visit the Temple of Heaven and perhaps to	walk	along the charming Liulichang Culture Street. [SEP] But there are other sights of interest. [SEP] The Foreign Legation, where foreign governments maintained their own autonomous quarter in Beijing from 1860 to 1937, lies east of Tiananmen Square. [SEP] No longer the location of the diplomatic compounds in the capital, this district still contains many former embassies, clubs, barracks, churches, and commercial buildings, most now converted to Chinese institutes, banks, and offices. [SEP] The architecture is fascinating. [SEP] Located along Taijichang Dajie (the former Customs Street), directly south of Dongchang’an Jie (Chang’an Avenue East), are the old Austrian Legation (now the Institute of International Studies), the Italian Legation (now the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
The Great Wall is best appreciated at four main sites north of Beijing: Badaling, Mutianyu, Simatai, and Juyongguan. [SEP] Three of these four segments have been carefully refurbished, with the exception of Simatai, which is largely untouched since the days of the early Ming Dynasty. [SEP] The earthen foundations of the wall and watchtowers, as well as much of the brick-work, are original, most of it 300 to 500 years old, although extensive remodeling and fresh materials have been added. [SEP] The look and the feel are authentic enough, once one is on the wall itself, out of sight of the shops, vendors, tour buses, parking lots, and cable cars below. [SEP] The hordes of tourists are another modern addition, of course, but it is possible at all these sites to	walk	beyond the crowds. [SEP] The steep mountain scenery is spectacular and the air is usually quite clear. [SEP] The sheer steepness of the wall’s stone stairs and the precarious footing provided by the irregular treads are what most surprise first-time visitors. [SEP] As it snakes up and down the peaks and ridges, the wall conforms to a challenging topography, one that leaves many tourists gasping for breath. [SEP] But the views from China’s ancient Dragon of Stone make the journey unforgettable. [SEP] Carefully restored in 1957, the Great Wall at Badaling, 67 km (42 miles) northwest of Beijing, is the most-visited portion of the wall. [SEP] The mountain setting is spectacular and the wall rises and falls steeply as it winds up and down the ridges.

Carefully restored in 1957, the Great Wall at Badaling, 67 km (42 miles) northwest of Beijing, is the most-visited portion of the wall. [SEP] The mountain setting is spectacular and the wall rises and falls steeply as it winds up and down the ridges. [SEP] About 7 m (24 ft) high and 5 m (18 ft) wide, this Ming Dynasty fortification is built of tamped earth, stone, and brick. [SEP] Beacon towers of stone and brick are mounted at regular intervals. [SEP] It is possible to	walk	the stairs of the restored section for about 2 km (11⁄2 miles) before reaching the crumbling remains of the original wall on either end. [SEP] At the northern terminus, there is a cable car connecting the wall to a parking lot below. [SEP] The parking lots at the base of the wall are filled with vendors, stores, restaurants, and other modern attractions, including a cinema and a KFC fast-food outlet. [SEP] Badaling is crowded, especially from June through September, but it is quite beautiful. [SEP] Equally attractive is the second-most visited section of the Great Wall at Mutianyu, 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Beijing. [SEP] Mutianyu was opened to tourists in 1986 to relieve the crowding at Badaling.

The Great Wall at Juyongguan, 58 km (36 miles) northwest of Beijing on the way to the Badaling section, is the newest portion of the wall open to tourism (1998) and the nearest to the capital. [SEP] Juyongguan contains a massive guard tower marking one of the Great Wall’s most celebrated mountain passes. [SEP] This guard tower, built in 1345, is decorated in Buddhist carvings, with inscriptions in Chinese, Tibetan, Sanskrit, and languages of the northern tribes. [SEP] Some of the temples and parks clustered at the pass in the days of the Ming dynasty have also been restored here. [SEP] The wall can be	walk	ed for 4 km (21⁄2 miles) as it winds over the peaks of the Taihang Mountains. [SEP] The least restored, least crowded major segment of the Great Wall near Beijing is at Simatai, 124 km (77 miles) northeast of the capital. [SEP] Not only is Simatai rather far from the capital, it is also quite uncrowded and unreconstructed. [SEP] Its stairways and watchtowers resemble those crumbling edifices one can only glimpse from Badaling, Mutianyu, and Juyongguan. [SEP] The natural scenery is dramatic, and the ruined state of the wall gives Simatai a romantic feel (although there is a cable car to the top). [SEP] It is also dangerous, with broken stairways leading up some of the 70-degree inclines.

The Reichstag A few minutes’	walk	from the Kongreßhalle you’ll find the Reichstag building, its huge, new glass dome, with its mirrored central funnel, visible from much of the city. [SEP] The parliamentary home of Wilhelminian and Weimar Germany displays the proud dedication Dem deutschen Volke (To the German People) on a Neo-Classical façade built in 1894 by Paul Wallot. [SEP] This appeal to patriotism and democracy, set above six Corinthian columns, outlasted the burning in 1933 and the bombs of World War II, and was given renewed significance when Berlin resumed its former role as the seat of government of a unified Germany.

On the western edge of Berlin, the dense pine forest which was largely stripped for fuel in 1945, has been replanted, adding to the 18 million pines around 6 million chestnut, linden, beech, birch, and oak trees. [SEP] The lush wooded areas form a reserve for deer, wild boar, marten, foxes, and rabbits, but there are also plenty of green meadows for picnics, and the forest paths are extremely popular with both cyclists and joggers. [SEP] The easiest and most direct way to get to the Grunewald is to take the S-Bahn from Bahnhof Zoo to Grunewald S-Bahn station. [SEP] Alternatively, you could combine your trip with a visit to the museums at Dahlem — the Brücke Museum is only a 20-minute	walk	from the eastern edge of the forest. [SEP] Drivers take the Avus and turn off on the Hüttenweg to Grunewaldsee, a lake offering swimming and sandy beaches. [SEP] On the east shore, in an attractive lakeside setting of beech trees, you will find the Jagdschloß Grunewald, a hunting lodge built in 1542 for Prince Elector Joachim II. [SEP] Situated in a cobbled courtyard, the lodge has been restored to its original Renaissance appearance. [SEP] Inside is displayed a rather curious collection of early German hunting portraits and landscapes, among which can be found some remarkable paintings, in particular a series of panels depicting the Passion Cycle by Lucas Cranach. [SEP] Other German and Dutch works of note are those by Jordaens, Rubens, and Bruyn.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] Other German and Dutch works of note are those by Jordaens, Rubens, and Bruyn. [SEP] There are marvelous views over the lake from the first- and second-floor rooms, and the period porcelain, furniture, and wooden floors add rustic charm. [SEP] The nominal admission charge includes entry to the small hunting museum (Jagdmuseum) on the opposite side of the courtyard. [SEP] A short	walk	down the path outside the lodge brings you to the rather grand Forsthaus Paulsborn, where you can dine in splendor overlooking the lake. [SEP] On the Grunewald’s west side, along Havelchaussee, the Grunewaldturm (Grunewald Tower) is a Neo-Gothic tower built in 1897 to commemorate the 100th birthday of King Wilhelm I. You can climb the 205 steps to reach the 55-m- (180-ft- ) high observation platform for views as far as Potsdam.

Brücke Museum The Bridge Museum is an intimate, single-story museum situated in a pleasant suburb about 20 minutes’	walk	from Jagdschloß Grunewald. [SEP] Take U1 to Oskar-Helene-Heim, then bus 115 to Pücklerstraße. [SEP] The museum is 5 minutes from the bus stop. [SEP] The museum was created in 1967 to house works of classical modernism, thanks to a legacy of Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, a member of the Expressionist group Die Brücke which worked in Dresden from 1905 to 1913. [SEP] A large number of the group’s works were labeled as “degenerate” and thus destroyed by the Nazis. [SEP] Schmidt-Rottluff’s own bold paintings hang beside the works of fellow Expressionists Emil Nolde, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, and Max Pechstein.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
From the bank, head for Queen Street, which leads north from the Birdcage, a metal cage once used by police officers to direct the traffic that regularly comes to a halt on Front Street. [SEP] It was designed by a Mr. Bird, although it also has a resemblance to “Tweetie Bird’s” cage. [SEP] Traffic lights now regulate the junction. [SEP] Remember to look right as you prepare to cross the road! [SEP] On the left as you	walk	up Queen Street is Perot Post Office, named after the man who was appointed Bermuda’s first Postmaster General in 1821. [SEP] He had actually been acting as “unofficial” postman for several years, meeting the ships and putting the letters under his hat before touring the town to deliver them. [SEP] William B. Perot (pronounced “Pea-rut”) went one stage further in 1848 when he began to produce his own postage stamps; only 11 are known to exist today, making each one extremely valuable. [SEP] The little Post Office is very much as Perot kept it, neat and simply furnished. [SEP] The building still houses an active post office, which makes it an appropriate place to buy the stamps for your postcards.

Across Victoria Street from the bus terminal is Victoria Park, originally a children’s playground but later landscaped to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. [SEP] The main features are the sunken garden, lawns, and flowerbeds in traditional English style, and the beautiful ornate iron bandstand, where open-air concerts are still performed during the summer and in December just before Christmas. [SEP] Return to Church Street and	walk	east to the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, consecrated in 1905 after a fire destroyed the previous edifice in 1884. [SEP] The style is Early English, with a tower rising 44 m (143 ft) to provide good views of the town. [SEP] You can climb to the top for a small donation to church funds; the tower is open on weekdays only. [SEP] Perhaps the most dramatic area in the church is the wall behind the altar, where there are sculptures in niches depicting Christ and the saints. [SEP] Completed in 1967 it is a fitting modern edition to the church. [SEP] By contrast, farther along Church Street is the oldest church in Hamilton, St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church (founded in 1843), as well as Wesley Methodist Church.

Outside the Cabinet building on Front Street is the Cenotaph, which commemorates Bermuda’s dead of the two World Wars. [SEP] The monument dates from 1920, its design based on that of the war memorial that stands in London’s Whitehall. [SEP] The solemn ceremonies of Remembrance Day take place here on 11 November each year, when wreaths are laid and silent homage is paid to those who gave their lives. [SEP] From Front Street, a ten-minute	walk	up the steep incline of King Street leads to Fort Hamilton, which was built in 1889 to protect the harbor and formed part of a line of defense for the naval dockyard to the west. [SEP] Today it offers spectacular views over the rooftops of Hamilton, especially thrilling when the cruise ships are in port. [SEP] The upper levels and battlements have been landscaped with fine lawns, which make a fine place for a summer picnic. [SEP] Long, cool tunnels in the depths of the defenses were originally dug as a protected route for ammunition replenishment.

You will come first to the Elbow Beach Resort and the nearby public Bermuda Beach. [SEP] The resort is one of the premier hotels on the island and sits on a long stretch of sand that is for hotel guests exclusively. [SEP] South Road travels on top of the cliffs and offers beautiful views of the sand dunes and beaches below. [SEP] Don’t worry about trying to take in these views while driving, for there are many stopping places along the way where you can take photographs or simply enjoy the panorama. [SEP] The way to each beach is marked with a wooden sign, which leads to parking areas for bicycles and cars off the main road. [SEP] Once you reach Warwick Long Bay there are a series of public beaches that allow you to	walk	along the sand or find a patch to call your own for the day. [SEP] Miles of footpaths in the dunes and undulating grassland behind the beaches have been designated as South Shore Park.

West End: Somerset and Ireland Islands The bridge that connects Somerset Island and its parish of Sandys (pronounced “Sands”) to the main island is quite short. [SEP] If you travelled on immediately it would be easy to miss one of the curiosities of Bermuda, for Somerset Bridge is said to be the narrowest drawbridge in the world. [SEP] The section which opens is wide enough to allow the passage of only a boat’s mast! [SEP] It is operated by simply lifting two planks of wood by hand; one has to marvel at the skill of the sailors who use the bridge regularly. [SEP] The bridge and surrounding supports were renovated in 1998. [SEP] The ferry service from Hamilton also stops here on its way to Dockyard. [SEP] Take the ferry or	walk	along the old Bermuda Railway Trail, which is extremely scenic along this section. [SEP] There are several deep “cuts” created for the rail line, with tiny wooden foot bridges over the top. [SEP] The road into Somerset Island leads around a pretty bay and onto Fort Scaur, which stands on a rocky hillock hidden from the road. [SEP] The fort was begun in 1869 to protect the land route to the naval dockyard at the end of the island. [SEP] The layout is the so-called Prussian design, a polygon shape developed by German engineers at the time. [SEP] The gunning placements held “disappearing” guns, which could not be seen from land or sea. [SEP] Other gunning placements were also added by US engineers during World War II.

Walk through the Cooperage to reach the Victualing Yard, where you will find the Tourist Information Bureau, then across the park and around the dry dock area, which is still used to repair the boats and buoys so vital to ship safety. [SEP] On the left is the Bermuda Pottery, where you’ll find experts crafting and firing ceramics with a series of island motifs. [SEP] Your	walk	will then lead to the Clocktower Building, perhaps the most elegant of the structures at dockyard. [SEP] Its long lines and minimalist façade once housed administrative offices, but the interior has been transformed into a smart shopping mall with luxury goods from jewelry to cigars. [SEP] Above the ground floor shops is a light, open space designed for conventions and exhibitions. [SEP] There are several restaurants in the dockyard as well as places to sit in the sunshine and have a picnic. [SEP] In summer, cruise ships dock at the small port outside the main harbor wall, providing a good picture of how the working dockyard must have looked when it was home to British naval vessels.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Bailey’s Bay is the northern section of Hamilton Parish, which you’ll find just before reaching the Causeway that crosses Castle Harbour to the airport and St. George’s. [SEP] Bailey’s Bay has a number of attractions within	walk	ing distance of each other.

Only a short	walk	west from the Inn, you will find the Bermuda Perfumery and Gardens. [SEP] This small family business was established in 1929 by Madeleine and Herbert Scott in a garden shed. [SEP] They moved to their present site in 1939 and proceeded to plant the acres of flowers that serve as raw materials to produce their small range of signature fragrances. [SEP] The business has now been passed on to their son. [SEP] You can take a free tour of the “factory,” housed in a 200-year-old farmhouse, where you can watch the process of perfume production, including the techniques for collecting the ripe blooms. [SEP] Then take your time and wander among the fragrant gardens with their swathes of jasmine, frangipani, and passion flower,their scents heavy in the warm air.

[SEP] There are no less than three separate fortifications here protecting the entrance to St. George’s Harbour. [SEP] The earliest was Burnt Point Fort, built in 1688 to help stop illegal trading by local sailors. [SEP] The Ferry Island Fort, on a small island a short distance offshore, was begun in the 1790s and was almost constantly developed for the next 80 years. [SEP] In 1823, Major Thomas Blanchard constructed Martello Tower on high ground behind the two forts, where soldiers could survey the surrounding land and coastline. [SEP] Today the remains of all three fortifications comprise Ferry Point Park, where it is possible to explore the forts at your leisure,	walk	through woodland, and enjoy the beauties of Lover’s Lake. [SEP] It is a wonderful place to have a picnic, and it’s relatively quiet, even on a summer weekend. [SEP] Returning to Ferry Point junction, take the north fork to St. George’s town. [SEP] You’ll travel around the far side of Mullet Bay — a sheltered natural harbor for small craft — and then past a children’s play area before reaching the outskirts of town.

 the Bunker Hill Monument commemorates the first battle of the Revolution, on 17 June, 1775 — a hollow victory for the British who suffered more than 1,000 casualties against 400 to 600 for the colonials. [SEP] Despite the name it actually stands on Breed’s Hill, the site of the colonial redoubt in the battle. [SEP] At its base is a swashbuckling statue by William Wetmore Storey of American Colonel Prescott, who gave the famous order: “Don’t fire ’til you see the whites of their eyes.” [SEP] There are informative models depicting the battle’s progress as well as hourly musket-firing demonstrations. [SEP] You can climb the 294 spiral steps to an enclosed deck, which has great views. [SEP] A multimedia presentation at The Bunker Hill Pavilion re-enacts the battle.

[SEP] Today after a long period of decline, the area has revived and the granite warehouses have been renovated into apartments, restaurants, offices, and hotels. [SEP] The British sailed home from Long Wharf. [SEP] Today you can sail to the Harbor Islands, take a cruise around the harbor, or just sit and admire the craft at anchor. [SEP] On Central Wharf, the New England Aquarium is one of the best anywhere. [SEP] Its centerpiece is a giant 200,000-gallon tank containing a 24-ft- (7-m-) deep coral reef filled with sharks, sea turtles, and 600 fish from 100 species. [SEP] Five times a day, scuba divers go in to feed the fish, a fascinating spectacle to watch. [SEP] Ramps circle the tank so that you can	walk	around the whole thing. [SEP] More than 70 exhibit tanks make up the Aquarium galleries. [SEP] They are categorized as salt or fresh water and feature communities of fish inhabiting different marine climates, from cold and temperate to tropical. [SEP] Visitors can see the life forms found in a salt marsh, a mangrove swamp, or along the New England seashore. [SEP] Kids love the Touch Tide Pool where they can handle crabs and starfish. [SEP] Other perennial favorites are the penguins, the sea otters, and the sea lions, who provide entertainment in the theater.

There’s an even better view from the top of the 253-ft (77-m) Pilgrim Monument in Provincetown. [SEP] It’s called the Pilgrim monument because this is where the Pilgrims actually landed first before moving on to Plymouth. [SEP] The museum at the base of the tower tells the story. [SEP] P-Town, is a fabled place. [SEP] Although the main street is crowded and lined with commercial tourist trinket stores, it still has a magical atmosphere, because it has an “anything goes” attitude. [SEP] It is the East Coast’s gay mecca (along with the Hamptons, and Cherry Grove and the Pines on Fire Island). [SEP] Same-sex couples	walk	the streets hand in hand, and outrageous transvestites entertain in the cabarets. [SEP] Families come to browse the stores selling T-shirts, and scrimshaw and driftwood curios, and to enjoy the beaches and the fishing and whale-watch trips. [SEP] In the early 20th century Provincetown was a major art colony and there are still numerous art galleries, particularly at the east end of town. [SEP] In summer, the town is swamped and every guesthouse filled. [SEP] In winter, it’s quiet. [SEP] Many of the commercial stores close and only the residents remain — a community of artists, Portuguese fishermen, and a handful of restaurateurs. [SEP] You can visit Provincetown for a day (see page 110), but if you don’t stay longer, you’ll miss half the fun.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
The area overlooks the city from a long, narrow plateau, divided into two: the southern part, occupied by the enormous Royal Palace where the original castle once stood, and the northern district of historic streets, where 14th- and 15th-century aristocrats and artisans once rubbed shoulders. [SEP] From Pest there are various ways of getting up to Castle Hill. [SEP] The most popular method of ascent is aboard the 19th-century sikló (funicular) which starts by the end of the Chain Bridge and rises to the Royal Palace. [SEP] Alternatively take the metro to Moszkva tér, climb up the steps to the road, and catch the mini Várbusz service which shuttles to and from Dísz tér, stopping at numerous points en route. [SEP] You could simply	walk	up the hill using any one of several streets and staircases, but one method you cannot use is your own transport; cars are forbidden on the hill (unless you are a resident or a guest at the Hilton Hotel), thus preserving the area’s historic ambience.

Historic Streets Turning right at the funicular terminus, a short	walk	brings you to Dísz tér (Parade Square) which marks the start of the northern district. [SEP] The Mátyás templom (Matthias Church) spire, towering gracefully over this historic area, is the best reference point for our tour. [SEP] The church takes its name from Hungary’s favourite medieval king, who married here twice in the 15th century. [SEP] The Emperor Franz Joseph I was crowned king of Hungary here in 1867, to the tune of the Coronation Mass, composed by Liszt for the occasion. [SEP] The original church was built in the mid-13th century, converted into a mosque during the Turkish occupation, and seriously damaged during Buda’s recapture in 1686. [SEP] It was rebuilt in Baroque style after the return of the Christian forces, and between 1873 and 1896 it was completely reconstructed along	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
At number 9 you can descend deep into the hill via a series of tunnels that were dug in medieval times as an escape route in times of siege. [SEP] They were used again as air-raid shelters and an emergency hospital in 1944–1945. [SEP] Here visitors can join a guided tour of the caves and tunnels, which also contain a waxwork exhibition depicting episodes of Hungarian history. [SEP] Uri utca terminates at Dísz tér, where it’s best to turn and	walk	back along Tárnok utca. [SEP] Among the shops and restaurants here are a number of ﬁne buildings. [SEP] The orange-and-red geometric frescoes painted on the overhanging ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Aranyhordó (Golden Barrel) restaurant are the most noteworthy. [SEP] Next door, number 18 was built as a merchant’s house in the ﬁrst half of the 15th century. [SEP] Used as the Arany Sas (Golden Eagle) pharmacy from 1750 until 1913, it is now the most attractive of this area’s small museums. [SEP] Beautiful old majolica vessels are the stars of an atmospheric re-creation of the pharmacy, and there are also informative displays on potions, practices, and alchemy in the Budapest of this era.

[SEP] Nowadays it’s a nightmare of Soviet town-planning, with heavy trafﬁc constantly rumbling past on the main northern highway out of Budapest. [SEP] Amid this unlikely setting, however, there are some major Roman remains to be discovered. [SEP] To begin the Roman route, take any number of city buses north to the so-called Military Amphitheatre (Katonai Amﬁteátrum), thus distinguishing it from a smaller one a short distance farther north. [SEP] Gladiators performed here in the second century to amuse legionnaires. [SEP] Completely forgotten for centuries, the ruins were only partially restored in the 1930s. [SEP] Now it’s effectively a grassy piece of parkland where locals play and	walk	their dogs, but enough remains of the amphitheatre walls and outline to give a good idea of what it was once like.

[SEP] Inside, look up to enjoy the exotic Art Nouveau styling and glasswork; then	walk	round to see the stylish front of the building, where there is an IBUSZ tourist information ofﬁce.

[SEP] The biggest church in Budapest, built between 1851 and 1905, it is frequently full to its capacity of 8,500 people. [SEP] Its exterior is in a poor state, though slowly being restored. [SEP] Before seeing the interior, ascend the tower. [SEP] It’s a long	walk	to the top, but you are rewarded with Pest’s highest viewpoint. [SEP] The interior of the basilica is dimly lit.

San Franciscans are quite unashamedly in love with their town. [SEP] Its natural setting, nestled in the hills around the bay, makes the city uncommonly cozy; the zip in the air is invigorating, and even the fog that rolls in off the ocean seems more romantic than chilling. [SEP] If you have a car, one way to begin your visit is to travel along 49-Mile Drive, which provides a comprehensive tour of the main sights. [SEP] You’ll need to use a good map, as the blue signposts with a white seagull in the center can be difficult to locate. [SEP] Stop off at Twin Peaks (the road to get there starts near the southern end of Market Street) for an excellent panoramic view of the city and the bay, then park the car, put on a pair of comfortable	walk	ing shoes, and take to the city’s first-class public transport system (see page 120). [SEP] Start at the bridge. [SEP] The city has more than one, but the one is, of course, the Golden Gate Bridge. [SEP] The name Golden Gate was given to the city’s harbor entrance in 1846 by Captain John Frémont, but the mile-wide channel lay unspanned until the bridge, a masterpiece of engineering by Joseph Strauss, was completed in 1937. [SEP] At 4,200 ft (1,280 m), it was the world’s longest single span until New York’s Verrazano Narrows Bridge surpassed it in 1964, but few would deny that it remains the most beautiful suspension bridge in the world.

At the Broadway Street edge of the Gaslamp Quarter, you can’t miss Horton Plaza, one of the best modern shopping malls in the United States. [SEP] Along with six floors of shops and restaurants, open-air terraces, and quirky decorations, visitors will find the local half-price ticket booth, Times Arts Tix (Tel. 619/497-5000). [SEP] Broadway ends at the harbor, where visitors can visit one of several 19th-century ships moored on the Embarcadero and belonging to the excellent Maritime Museum. [SEP] The city’s pride and joy is the iron-hulled square-rigger Star of India, built in the Isle of Man in 1863. [SEP] The Star is the oldest sailing ship that is still seaworthy; she makes a celebratory cruise twice each summer. [SEP] A brief	walk	along the waterfront leads to Seaport Village, a lively complex of shops, restaurants, and galleries overlooking the harbor. [SEP] One of the best ways to appreciate San Diego’s sparkling beauty is from the sea. [SEP] You can take a cruise along the bay — boat trips leave from Harbor Drive, just south of the Maritime Museum — out past the man-made Harbor and Shelter Islands and around the tip of the Coronado peninsula (occupied by a US Naval Air Station — the film Top Gun was set nearby in northern San Diego) to Point Loma out on the Pacific coast.

The oldest part of San Diego is situated 3 miles (4.8 km) north of downtown in the area known as Old Town (bounded by Juan, Congress, Twiggs, and Wallace streets). [SEP] Here, in 1769, the European colonization of California commenced, beginning with the construction of Father Junípero Serra’s Mission San Diego de Alcala. [SEP] In this area of restored adobe buildings, you can enjoy a rest under the palms and eucalyptus of Plaza Vieja (originally the town plaza and bullfight arena before the Yankees arrived), browse among the stalls selling Mexican handicrafts, or eat at one of the many restaurants. [SEP] Cabrillo National Monument, situated on the Point Loma promontory (I-5/I-8 exit on Rosecrans Street and follow the signs), celebrates the man who discovered San Diego Bay. [SEP] You can	walk	the trails around the point, visit the Old Point Loma Lighthouse, and at low tide explore the tide pools for crabs, starfish, anemone, and, if you are lucky, perhaps even the odd, elusive octopus. [SEP] If you’re here between December and March, watch for migrating gray whales from the look-out point near the lighthouse. [SEP] Other aquatic pursuits can be enjoyed at Mission Bay, a first-class watersports center and park. [SEP] The bay is also home of the famous Sea World marine park, where you’ll be able to watch performing two-ton killer whales.

[SEP] Continue to Dante’s View (altitude 5,745 ft/1,750 m), where you can look out westward to Wildrose, Bennett, and Telescope peaks. [SEP] Down in the valley in front of you lies the salty puddle called Badwater — at 282 ft (86 m) below sea level, which is the lowest point in the western hemisphere. [SEP] The crazed and pinnacled surface of the salt-caked lake bed has earned it the nickname of Devil’s Golf Course. [SEP] Take a	walk	out across that glaring expanse of baked salt — the atmosphere of desolation is almost exhilarating. [SEP] If you look closer at the salt under your feet, you’ll discover that the expansion of the crystallizing mineral has heaved it into bizarre funnels, swirls, and other intricate patterns. [SEP] On the way back toward Furnace Creek lies Artist’s Drive, where the road (one way only from south to north) carves its path through a canyon of multi-colored rocks, culminating in the very aptly named Artist’s Palette.

[SEP] The park’s driveway takes you out to the Rockcliffe Lookout for a spectacular view of the Ottawa River and the mouth of the Gatineau. [SEP] In the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Barracks, at the north end of St. Laurent Boulevard, you can see some of the horses performing or training for the popular RCMP Musical Ride, the one occasion when the Mounties are still Mounties.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Mount Royal For an overall view of the city, start with a bracing	walk	up the slopes of the charming Mount Royal Park (Parc du Mont-Royal). [SEP] Follow the footpath and stairs from the end of Peel Street or a shorter route from the Chemin Remembrance car park. [SEP] Perhaps the most pleasant way is to take a leisurely ride in a horse-drawn carriage from Dominion Square. [SEP] Known with characteristic local irony as la Montagne (the Mountain), the heights were spotted by Jacques Cartier on his historic journey up the St. Lawrence River in 1535, and named Mont Réal in homage to his king François I.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
rance as wives for bachelor farmers and fur traders. [SEP] In the 19th century, Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours became the “Sailors’ Chapel,” to which survivors of shipwrecks brought model ships they had carved as offerings of thanksgiving. [SEP] The models still hang from the ceiling, lit up now by tiny electric bulbs. [SEP] Notice how the trompe l’oeil painting on the low arched ceiling aspires to turn the little church into a lofty Gothic cathedral. [SEP] Climb the church tower for a good view of Vieux Montréal and the harbor. [SEP] Most of the ugly old warehouses have been demolished along the Vieux Port at the foot of Place Jacques-Cartier. [SEP] Some have been refurbished as cafés or hotels; one pier now houses the headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil, another an IMAX theater. [SEP] Take a	walk	along the port to Pointe à Callières, where the Ville-Marie settlers first landed. [SEP] An obelisk on the nearby Place Royale commemorates their adventure. [SEP] The statue at the Pointe is of an Anglo-Canadian, John Young, who developed the port’s commerce in the 19th century. [SEP] The rue St-Sulpice takes you over the Place d’Armes, close to the site of the first French battles with the Iroquois. [SEP] Today it serves as a visual link between the historic old town of the pioneers and the new city of commerce and industry. [SEP] In the middle is a statue of Maisonneuve, looking very like one of Alexandre Dumas’ musketeers. [SEP] He’s brandishing the royal French fleur-de-lys flag that inspired the Québec provincial flag of today.

[SEP] It is named after Count Louis de Frontenac, a rascally 17th-century French governor who upset the clergy by encouraging the sale of brandy to the native peoples. [SEP] Take a look inside at the stucco carvings, tapestries, and handsome wood paneling. [SEP] Behind the hotel, beyond an 1898 statue of Samuel de Champlain, the city’s founder, Dufferin Terrace offers a magnificent view over the St. Lawrence and downriver to the Ile d’Orléans. [SEP] Stroll alongside a pleasant little garden, Parc des Gouverneurs, with its obelisk paying tribute to Generals Wolfe and Montcalm, both killed at the great battle for Québec in 1759. [SEP] The terrace is prolonged by the Promenade des Gouverneurs, continuing the	walk	along the foot of the citadel towards Battlefields Park. [SEP] North of the Frontenac, Place d’Armes is the center of Old Québec, where troops were mustered and paraded, proclamations read out, criminals whipped or executed. [SEP] In the middle, the Monument of Faith (Monument de la Foi) commemorates the work of French Catholic missionaries in North America. [SEP] On the north side of the square, the Musée du Fort, 10 rue Ste-Anne, stages a sound and light show alternately in English and French on the military history of Québec City.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Down on the harborfront today, the old wharves, warehouses, even the houses of joyous ill-repute that cluster in back streets around any international port have been refurbished as Historic Properties, a bright and breezy neighborhood of artists’ studios and galleries, shops, restaurants, and taverns with open-air terraces. [SEP] The board	walk	takes you through a colorful architecture of red brick, timber, grey stone, and gaily painted clapboard. [SEP] Summer attractions include a puppet theater, concerts, lobster races, and windsurfing competitions. [SEP] At the international tournament of town criers, hear local newsmongers in 18th-century costume pitting their Oyez! against the best bellowers from Britain and Bermuda.

You are plunged into the atmosphere of that “moment in time” as soon as you get off the park bus at the Georges des Roches fishing property, a long turf-roofed log cabin outside the fortified town. [SEP] The men may be laying out dozens of cod to dry on what are known as flakes, the same trestled wooden racks still used in fishing villages all down the coast. [SEP] At the drawbridge to Porte Dauphine, the main entrance gate bearing a relief of three fleurs-de-lys, the French royal coat of arms, you’ll be stopped by French soldiers to check whether you’re a British spy. [SEP] If they let you through (they usually do),	walk	past the Dauphin bastion to the handsomely carved stone portside gate, Porte Frédéric. [SEP] Turn right into the town along the main street, past the hospitable eating establishments of the Hôtel de la Marine and L’Epée Royale, where you can get a characteristic 18th-century meal served on tin or pewter plates. [SEP] Continue over to the King’s Bastion, the military barracks where living conditions show the kind of stark contrast that nurtured enough discontent to cause a mutiny in that year of 1744. [SEP] The gabled Governor’s Wing numbers ten luxurious apartments with fine furniture, tapestries, silks, brocades, silverware, and delicate porcelain.

 Bay of Fundy’s extraordinary tides, with a variation from low to high tide of 8.5 m (26 ft) at the mouth of the Saint John River. [SEP] Watch the Reversing Falls Rapids from the bridge on Highway 100. [SEP] The tourist information office there will tell you the best times to watch the tides’ evolution. [SEP] At low tide, the Fundy’s waters are 4 m (13 ft) lower than the Saint John River, causing it to cascade through a narrow gorge into the bay. [SEP] Gradually the flow slows down as the tide begins to rise again. [SEP] At the tide’s turn, the slack enables ships to pass the rapids before the flow builds up in the opposite direction. [SEP] The bay’s high tide of more than 4 m (13 ft) above the river thrusts all the way inland to Fredericton, 130 km (78 miles) away.

Bay of Fundy Take Highway 1 northeast from Saint John and turn off at Penobsquis to head for Fundy National Park, a wonderful nature reserve with an emphasis on the seashore and its spectacular high tides. [SEP] At the park entrance, you can get detailed maps of the 110 km (68 miles) of hiking and biking trails linking campgrounds and chalets inside the park. [SEP] An arts-and-crafts school offers courses in wood-carving and copper jewelry for adults, and basket-weaving and glass-painting for children. [SEP] On Bennett Lake, you can rent a canoe or fish from a rowboat. [SEP] On the shore,	walk	along the flats at low tide to seek out periwinkles, barnacles, and sea anemones underneath the rocks. [SEP] Herring Cove gives you a good view and detailed explanations of the tides. [SEP] Take a side-trip to Hopewell Cape at the mouth of the Petit-codiac River. [SEP] If you can, camp overnight, as dawn is the perfect time to enjoy the view of its red cliffs and bizarre pillars of granite topped with tufts of balsam fir and black spruce, revealed at low tide.

into the Burrard Inlet, the waterway that George Vancouver explored in a scouting boat in 1791. [SEP] The harbor separates the city proper, with the Stanley Park promontory, from its elegant north shore mountainside suburbs of West and North Vancouver. [SEP] To take in all this, you need to begin from not one, but two observation points. [SEP] Cross the First Narrows on Lions Gate Bridge and take the Capilano Road for a cable-car ride, “Skyride,” up to Grouse Mountain and its grand view south over the city and harbor. [SEP] Try to be there at sunset, too, to see the city light up. [SEP] A favorite with skiers, the mountain also offers a fine view northwest over Capilano Lake and across to Vancouver Island. [SEP] If you feel like a quick whiff of the wilderness on your way back, turn off to	walk	the swaying suspension bridge 76 m (230 ft) above the fast-flowing waters of Capilano Canyon. [SEP] To get an equally impressive view of the city set against its mountains, go downtown to the observation deck (and its restaurant, if you like) on top of the 40-story Harbour Centre (555 West Hastings Street).

Turning west, you’ll pass on the seaward side a bronze statue oddly named Girl in a Wet Suit, a version of Copenhagen’s mermaid designed not to shock. [SEP] Stop off at Prospect Point for a good view of oil tankers and grain cargo ships bound for Japan, China, or Russia. [SEP] A totem pole marks the site where Captain Vancouver met with members of the Squamish tribe. [SEP] At the Aquarium the star attractions are the dolphin show and the beluga whales, closely followed by polar bears. [SEP] Equally fantastic are wolf-eels with crab-cracking jaws. [SEP] Bears and monkeys seem to be having much less fun at the nearby zoo.

[SEP] Stop off at Shannon Falls, a short	walk	away from the road on an easy gravel path over footbridges into the forest. [SEP] You can picnic at the bottom of the cliff over which the water cascades. [SEP] Famous for its August log-rolling contests, the town of Squamish makes a useful base for hiking tours into Garibaldi Provincial Park. [SEP] The winter sports resort of Whistler offers excellent summer facilities, too: bicycles, kayak and river-rafting or more sedate swimming, golf, and tennis. [SEP] Take the ski-lift for views across the Coastal Mountains or stroll around Lost Lake — good trout-fishing — but beware of a pretty yellow flower known as skunk cabbage that smells like its name when you pick it.

Coming from Vancouver, board the car ferry at Horseshoe Bay for Nanaimo and head north on Highway 19. [SEP] Turn west at Parksville to cross the island on Highway 4. [SEP] This takes you through some of the province’s finest forestland: the red cedar of canoes, totem poles and longhouses; stately Douglas fir, mainstay of white man’s bridges, boats, houses, and flagstaffs; and the good old Sitka spruce Christmas tree. [SEP] About 20 km (12 miles) from Parksville, look for a signpost to Little Qualicum Falls. [SEP] The well-marked	walk	loops around the upper falls tumbling into a ravine, then follows the river rapids along to the lower falls that crash into another rocky gorge. [SEP] You can extend the hike along the river for a picnic or bracing swim at Cameron Lake. [SEP] Highway 4 follows the lake shore to Cathedral Grove, a formidable stand of Douglas firs in MacMillan Provincial Park, donated to the public by a paper manufacturer as a gesture for government permission to exploit less accessible parts of the forest. [SEP] Many of the firs, up to 76 m (230 ft) high, are more than 300 years old, the most ancient dating back to the 12th century. [SEP] Excellent explanatory panels trace the growth of these majestic trees.

[SEP] With only one secluded hotel on its shores, the pearshaped lake’s tranquillity is less troubled by noisy tour groups than some of the more popular Rocky Mountain resorts. [SEP] The lake path makes a delightful two-hour ramble through woodland, giving you a good chance of spotting some of the park’s small wildlife, notably some very chubby brown porcupine and an occasional beaver. [SEP] Back on the Trans-Canada, the turn-off 6 km (31/2 miles) after Field takes you past the park information center to a steep winding route through the pine forests of the Yoho Valley. [SEP] Signposted on the right, 13 km (8 miles) into the valley is a short	walk	to the foot of the spectacular Takakkaw Falls. [SEP] Takakkaw is an Indian word for “magnificent,” a fair description of the waters spilling out of the outflow of the Daly Glacier. [SEP] Unlike many waterfalls, this one is at its most spectacular on the hottest summer afternoons, when the glacier ice melts. [SEP] For a panoramic view of the glacier, take the Highline Trail 1 km (1/2 mile) south of the falls, starting out from the Whiskey Jack Hostel. [SEP] On the way back, stop south of the confluence of the Yoho and Kicking Horse rivers for a view of the Spiral Tunnels.

[SEP] Stop first at the Crowfoot Glacier, where you can see the foot’s two remaining “toes,” the third having broken away. [SEP] The mass of ice facing you is 55 m (165 ft) thick. [SEP] At Bow Summit, leave the Parkway at the signpost to the viewpoint overlooking the lovely Peyto Lake, a deep turquoise at the height of summer. [SEP] If you have time, stop at Kilometer 119 on the Parkway, to hike up the winding path to Parker’s Ridge (2,185 m/6,560 ft) above pretty alpine meadows overlooking the Saskatchewan Glacier, the beginning of the great North Saskatchewan River that ends up in Hudson Bay.

[SEP] This is just one of the town’s many modern skyscrapers clustered around the commercial hub of Portage and Main, which has the reputation of being the windiest spot in Canada. [SEP] In the splendid Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature (190 Rupert Avenue), prehistoric and present-day animals are presented in beautifully recreated environments of Arctic wastelands, tundra, woodland, and waterfalls, complete with bird sounds, eerie wolf howls, or the terrifying roar of a forest fire. [SEP] The province’s ethnic groups are shown in traditional costume and old homesteads; special emphasis is given to Manitoba’s Indians and a Métis buffalo hunt. [SEP] Be sure to	walk	around the reconstructed decks of the 17th-century Nonsuch ketch that pioneered Hudson Bay’s involvement in the fur trade. [SEP] The museum adjoins the Centennial Center, home of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, Manitoba Opera Association and Royal Winnipeg Ballet.

[SEP] It is one of the busiest ports in the world. [SEP] The real hub of Las Palmas is the Parque de Santa Catalina. [SEP] This square is effectively one gigantic outdoor café that buzzes day and night, and is just a short	walk	to Playa de las Canteras. [SEP] This superb golden beach stretches for 3 to 5 km (2 to 3 miles) and a natural reef just offshore means that the water couldn’t be calmer. [SEP] Las Canteras and the area behind it reflect the city’s cosmopolitan nature. [SEP] Like the city in general, it has seen better days and is losing younger tourist trade to the smarter modern resorts in the south.

[SEP] This includes works by Picasso and Miró, and is also notable for the contrast between the modern exhibits and the ancient structure that houses them.

[SEP] Its eastern shoreline is one long beach of fine white sand (there are seven named beaches along the strip), which is washed by the translucent azure waters of the Caribbean. [SEP] Between the island and the mainland is Laguna Nichupté, a huge seawater lagoon bounded by mangrove swamps that are havens to numerous species of wildlife. [SEP] Today a string of hotels have taken much of the beachfront real estate; the balance given over to bars, nightclubs, and shopping malls. [SEP] On the lagoon side, watersports and eco-tours abound in the calmer shallow waters. [SEP] Blue signs denote public beach access and there are no restrictions, so you can	walk	the island’s full length without concerns about trespass. [SEP] All in all, Cancún has everything needed for the perfect relaxing vacation. [SEP] Finding your way around the resort couldn’t be simpler.

[SEP] The remains of San Gervasio are located several kilometers from the site entrance, and though not on the scale of the major Mayan settlements of the mainland, the beautiful tropical park environment makes the ruins worth exploring. [SEP] Most structures date from the post-classical period (1200–1650); the site was still in use when the Spanish arrived.

[SEP] The main building at the site is the Iglesia or church, a huge pyramid nearly 30 m (90 ft) high. [SEP] It sits among a number of structures known as the Grupo Cobá, which lie to the right of the main entrance. [SEP] Its major staircase has been cleared, and the view from the top is spectacular, with the lakes and jungle stretching out to cover the land. [SEP] At irregular intervals, vegetation-covered mounds indicate other pyramids yet to be freed. [SEP] The only other large structure in view is the stone façade of Nohoch Mul (Big Hill) some 20 minutes’	walk	away. [SEP] At 42 m (138 ft), Nohoch Mul is the largest Mayan pyramid yet discovered; there are 120 steps to its upper platform. [SEP] Once there you will find images of the Descending God — the same image seen so often at Tulum.

The Forbidden City, so described because it was off-limits to ordinary people for nearly 500 years, is now called the Palace Museum. [SEP] Designed to contain the auspicious number of 9,999 rooms, its scale is overwhelming and leaves many visitors bewildered. [SEP] Built in the years 1406–1420, it was the residence of 24 emperors for nearly seven centuries. [SEP] Tourists normally enter the Forbidden City from the south, after a long	walk	along a cobbled roadway from the Gate of Heavenly Peace. [SEP] The main entrance to the compound, Meridian Gate (Wumen), was designed in the 15th century. [SEP] Officials used the left portal, members of the imperial family the right.

[SEP] Beyond this powerful defense line stands China’s supreme ensemble of ancient architecture. [SEP] First and foremost is the Hall of Great Harmony (Taihedian), popularly called the “Hall of the Imperial Throne.” [SEP] This is the biggest building in the Forbidden City and one of China’s most beautiful wooden structures.

The first elements of the wall system were built more than 2,000 years ago, but the expansion and consolidation of the project near Beijing began under the Ming Dynasty in the 14th century. [SEP] The serpentine stone bulwark and elevated highway became Wanlichangcheng — “The Wall Ten Thousand Li Long” (about 6,000 km/3,700 miles). [SEP] The restored section of the wall at Badaling, undulating up the unexpectedly steep hillsides, can be a test of a tourist’s endurance. [SEP] It is far steeper and more formidable than it looks in any tourist brochure. [SEP] Out of breath, many visitors exchange sympathetic smiles along the way as they ascend to one or another of the towers. [SEP] If you	walk	far enough west, you come upon unrestored sections of the wall at the edge of the Gobi Desert. [SEP] The Badaling section is often overcrowded these days. [SEP] Two other sections now provide relatively easy access to tourists: the Great Wall at Mutianyu, as beautiful as the section at Badaling but a little less steep, and the Great Wall at Simatai, more distant from Beijing than other sections but virtually unrestored. [SEP] Simatai is the least crowded and most original of the Great Wall sites. [SEP] Although it too has a cable-car concession, Simatai bills itself as “the most dangerous section of the Great Wall.”	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
The sightseeing you remember best might be the lively free market lining the hundreds of steps that descend higgledy-piggledy from the hills of central Chongqing to the river. [SEP] Hustling, bustling peasants hawk the rich harvest of the surrounding farming country: cabbages and oranges, eggs and live chickens (they are weighed while flapping), river fish and squirming eels, and table after table of the most fragrant spices, while stalls and hole-in-the-wall cafés heat up the city’s number-one dish, the Sichuan hotpot. [SEP] Leading down to the river’s edge, the steep stone stairway known as the Gate to the Sky (Chaotianmen), which appears not to have been cleaned since the Ming Dynasty, is treacherously overlaid with mud and muck, so wear your safest shoes and	walk	with care. [SEP] Happily, at the bottom of this long descent there is a terminal for the funicular that returns you to the top of this town, which is so hilly bicycles are almost unknown. [SEP] Sights worth seeing in town include the Chongqing People’s Hall, built in 1953 to serve as a 4,000-seat conference hall and hotel. [SEP] It blends the styles of the Ming and Qing dynasties with the needs of a modern conference hall. [SEP] The Chongqing Museum, while poorly-lit and aging, does contain a collection of dinosaur eggs and two 3,000-year-old wooden boats that, suspended from the cliffs of the Yangzi, served as caskets for nobles in the days of the Ba Kingdom. [SEP] Perhaps the liveliest sight in Chongqing is the 1,000-year-old Luohan Temple, where blind fortune-tellers and devoted follower	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
The café life in Dali is one of its chief delights. [SEP] Cafés are perfect spots to wile away the sunny hours over coffee or beer or to meet local Bai people as well as other travelers. [SEP] Perhaps the most famous of the dozens of cafés is Mr. China Son’s Cultural Exchange Café, run by Uncle Li (Heliyi), the first Bai in history to go abroad. [SEP] His autobiography, on sale at his café, is an epic soap opera. [SEP] Dali also has sights and attractions well worth attending to when the café and bistro scene begins to pale. [SEP] Erhai Lake is a 30-minute	walk	from town, and its main village, Caicun, is a maze of unpaved alleys and mud houses. [SEP] Ferries cross the lake to even more remote villages, including the temple dedicated to Guanyin (goddess of mercy) on Putuo Island. [SEP] Any of dozens of local travel agents can quickly arrange an excursion to lakeside villages, including the market at Wase. [SEP] One popular diversion is the Monday morning outdoor market at Shaping, 30 minutes up the eucalyptus-lined road by minibus from Dali. [SEP] It’s a vast market of country wares, batik, and horse-trading, with hundreds of locals dressed in their traditional bright Bai jackets, tunics, and plumed caps. [SEP] The chief monument at Dali is the Temple of the Three Pagodas (Santasi), founded in 825.

Southeast of the city is Thousand Buddha Mountain (Qianfoshan), but instead of a thousand Buddha images you’ll find a hundred today. [SEP] And, at only 280 m (about 900 ft) above sea level, it is more a hill than a “mountain.” [SEP] But a hike up the hill and down again permits a close look at old temples, grottoes with Buddhist statues, and refreshing forests. [SEP] Of all the springs in Jinan, the one with the most historical associations is the Jet Spring (Baotuquan). [SEP] It was from this spring in the 17th century that the Qing Dynasty Emperor Kangxi took a swig and pronounced it the “First Spring Under Heaven.” [SEP] It is now surrounded by a carefully landscaped park. [SEP] A short	walk	away is Black Tiger Spring (Heihuquan), its sweet water roaring from the mouths of three tigers carved in a black stone cliffside. [SEP] As the provincial capital, Jinan is the site of the Shandong Provincial Museum, where more than 400,000 items illustrate local history and nature. [SEP] The highlight of the collection is an exhibition of Longshan Black Pottery found near Jinan — an elegant, delicate ware fired 4,000 years ago.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
From the busy harbor square, overlooked by the balconies of the venerable Lujiang Hotel, you can stroll into old-town areas along Zhongshan Road, past dozens of antique shophouses and cafés. [SEP] Or you can head south along Minzu Road and take in the life of the fishing boats and warehouses on the quays. [SEP] If you	walk	long enough (or hail a taxi), you end up at Nanputuo Temple, nestled in the hillside on the east shore of the harbor. [SEP] This Buddhist complex is in immaculate condition, its marble a gleaming white. [SEP] Locals are always on hand, burning incense and praying for good fortune. [SEP] The rocky cliffs behind the temple make for fine hiking and picnicking. [SEP] South of the temple and past Xiamen University (founded in 1921 by a local who made good in Singapore) is the Huli Mountain Cannon Platform. [SEP] In 1921 the Germans placed their artillery here to defend the colonial port of Amoy, as Xiamen was known to Westerners. [SEP] From here, if you look across the Formosa Strait on a sunny day, you can make out the disputed islands of Mazu and Jinmen.

e settlement into a major trading port serving Granada, and it was one of the last cities in Spain to be re-conquered by Christian forces in 1487. [SEP] A good place to begin a tour is at Málaga’s principle landmark, Gibralfaro (from the Arabic Jebel al Faro — Lighthouse Hill). [SEP] Located some 130 m (425 ft) above the city, this hilltop is capped by the ramparts of a Phoenician castle reconstructed in the 14th century by the Moors (who went on to build the lighthouse that gave Gibralfaro its name). [SEP] The restored walls and parapets offer a superb panoramic view of both the city below and the coastline disappearing into the horizon. [SEP] Because it looks down on the Plaza de Toros, the hill also acts as free seating for bullfights taking place below. [SEP] Although it is possible to	walk	here, it is not recommended. [SEP] Not only is the pathway somewhat difficult in places, it is also a well-known hangout for muggers. [SEP] Best, then, to take a taxi. [SEP] Back at sea level is the delightful Paseo del Parque, with contrasting fountains at either end, which connects the old town with the Plaza de Toros. [SEP] On its south side, it is a lush seaside tropical garden enhanced by fountains, duck ponds, and small bars. [SEP] The other side is home to the smaller Jardínes Puerta Oscura and two impressive buildings, the Ayuntamiento (Town Hall) and the 18th-century La Aduana (Old Custom House).	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Immediately behind here is the sprawling Alcazaba fortress/palace complex that the Moors built between the 11th and 14th centuries. [SEP] A cobbled path climbs up the hillside within the walls to the portal dubbed Arco del Cristo (Gateway of Christ). [SEP] The victorious Christian army of Ferdinand and Isabella celebrated mass here when the fortress finally fell into their hands in 1487. [SEP] Higher still, the one-time palace (a disappointment compared with those in Granada and Sevilla) contains a small archaeological museum. [SEP] Beside the entrance to the Alcazaba are the partially excavated ruins of a Roman theater, the only visible remains of the ancient city. [SEP] A short	walk	away is the cathedral, known locally as La Manquita — the one-armed lady — because one of its twin towers remains unfinished. [SEP] The north tower soars 100 m (some 330 ft) above the street, but work on the other, a forlorn stump of stone, stopped in 1783 because of a lack of money. [SEP] Málaga was the birthplace of Pablo Ruiz Picasso, though the young artist left his native city at age 14 for the more cosmopolitan climates of Madrid and Barcelona. [SEP] The house he was born in, Casa Natal Picasso at Plaza de la Merced 14, doubles as a small museum and research center. [SEP] On a larger scale is the nearby Museo de Bellas Artes (Fine Arts Museum), an old Renaissance-style palace with pleasing patios.

Mijas Eight kilometers (5 miles) inland from Fuengirola and clinging to the hillside is Mijas. [SEP] Surrounded by modern villas and urbanizaciones (developments), it looks from the outside like any other quaint village with whitewashed houses. [SEP] But Mijas is different. [SEP] Most of the houses have been converted into upscale shops, restaurants, or bars, making the village itself a unique tourist attraction. [SEP] Traffic is banned from the center, so if you don’t feel like the short	walk	from the parking lot, take a mule taxi. [SEP] Mijas has Spain’s only square bullring, and across from it, beautifully tended gardens slope down to a cliff-top mirador, with fine views all along the coast. [SEP] There is another mirador beside the car park. [SEP] On one side of this natural balcony you will find a tiny chapel dedicated to the Virgen de la Peña (Our Lady of the Mountain), set in a grotto carved from living rock.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
 the Moors in the 11th and 12th centuries, and it is from that period that the impressively walled and towered Alcázar dates. [SEP] Inside is a simple but elegant mosque that was later converted into a chapel dedicated to Santa María la Real. [SEP] Re-conquered by King Alfonso X in 1264, it became one of the most prosperous towns in Andalucía after the discovery of the Americas and the reunification of Spain in 1492. [SEP] Below the Alcázar lies the Colegiata (Collegiate Church), a towering dark stone cathedral dating from the 17th to 18th centuries. [SEP] Housed within is the precious image of Cristo de la Viña (Christ of the Vineyard). [SEP] It was the development of the sherry wine and brandy business that brought the city worldwide acclaim and more prosperity. [SEP] It is impossible to	walk	the streets without recognizing bodegas (wineries) of prestigious old firms such as Harvey, Williams & Humbert, Gonzalez-Byass, and Pedro Domecq. [SEP] As some of the names imply, it was a group of English merchants who launched Jerez as the world capital of fortified wine. [SEP] Three centuries on, their descendants continue to control the sherry trade. [SEP] All the larger companies offer tours of their bodegas, mostly on weekday mornings, and some require you to reserve in advance.

Iráklion was a thriving port in Minoan times and became known as Herakleium under Roman rule. [SEP] The arrival of the Venetians changed the town’s fortune. [SEP] They chose it as their capital, bestowing the name Candia on both the city and the whole island. [SEP] Candia blossomed with the riches of Venetian trade, and when Turkish forces stormed the island, the town held out for several months before falling into the Moslem hands. [SEP] It became a relative backwater of the Ottoman Empire only to rise to prominence again following union with Greece. [SEP] It was declared capital again in 1971, taking the title from Chaniá in the west. [SEP] The city center lies within the walls of a vast fortress started by the Venetians and reinforced by the Turks. [SEP] It is possible to	walk	along the walls, which seem to be swallowed up by the higher modern buildings of the city, to gain an impression of how large the citadel once was. [SEP] The heart of the city is tiny Venizélos Square (Plateía Venizélou) with its fringe of cafés and restaurants. [SEP] At its center, the Morosini Fountain dates from Venetian times, though the somber lion statues are three hundred years older. [SEP] Formerly waterspouts, these now stay dry.

[SEP] They are now on view inside. [SEP] Head across 25 August Street to a small park — El Greco — named after the painter, a native of Crete, whose true name was Dominicos Theotokópoulos. [SEP] Here you can sit under the shade of the trees away from the noise of the traffic. [SEP] Continuing along 25 August Street leads to the waterfront and the majestic sight of the Venetian fortress (Koúles), built to protect the old harbor. [SEP] You’ll also see the vaulted remains of large arcaded asenali (ship repair yards) that serviced the Venetian fleet. [SEP] The fortress sits out on the breakwater and you will	walk	past the city’s fishing fleet to reach it. [SEP] Small colorful boats with piles of yellow nets are waiting to set sail for the next day’s catch. [SEP] The fortress was completed in 1540 to protect the town against the Ottoman threat. [SEP] It proved a fine defense and was instrumental in Candia’s ability to hold out so long in the siege of the city throughout the 1660s.

Immediately north of Venizélos Square you’ll reach 1866 Street (Odós 1866), also known as Market Street, which still has the atmosphere of an old Turkish bazaar. [SEP] Here you’ll be able to stroll past stalls selling fresh produce and souvenirs, or eat at the numerous small ouzeries that serve the market workers. [SEP] At the southern end of Market Street is Kornárou Square (Plateía Kornárou) where you will find the Bembo Fountain (Kríni Bembo) created in the 16th century using numerous pieces of architectural salvage — including the fine torso of a Greco-Roman statue. [SEP] A short	walk	from here to the left along the inner arterial road brings you to St. Catherine’s Square (Plateía Agías Ekaterínis) where the 19th-century Cathedral of Ághios Minás dwarfs two older religious buildings. [SEP] The small church immediately next to it is the Church of Ághios Minás, which has a splendid ornate iconostasis — if the church is closed ask in the cathedral as the custodian here has the key. [SEP] Behind these two churches is the 15th-century place of worship that gives the square its name; Church of St. Catherine (Agía Ekateríni).

The golden era came to an end in 1450 [SEP] b.c. [SEP] and major fire caused catastrophic damage around 1350 [SEP] b.c. [SEP] , but though the palace was completely destroyed the site continued to be occupied until the 5th century [SEP] a.d. [SEP] The palace was erected around a large Central Court, used for public meetings, which now forms the heart of the site. [SEP] Imagine Minoans at play here as depicted on the pottery and frescoes in the Archaeological Museum in Iráklion — acrobats and dancers as well as the famed bull leapers. [SEP] Visitors enter past what remains of the West Court used as an entryway to a West Wing, where the administrative and religious activities took place. [SEP] Minoans would	walk	down the corridor of processions past frescoed walls to reach the propylaia (sacred entranceway). [SEP] A Grand Staircase then led north to the most important official chambers within this wing, its sturdy painted colonnades typical of those found throughout the palace. [SEP] The lower floor here houses the throne room with ornate griffin frescoes and a lustral basin for ritual purification. [SEP] The gypsum throne is the oldest in Europe and traces of paint show that it would have been brightly colored when in use. [SEP] The walls — lined with stone seats thought to have been used by advisers or councilors — would have been decorated with red plaster and an ornamental dado.

To reach the ancient sites drop down from Agía Vavára on to the Plain. [SEP] Near the village of Agía Déka — named after ten saints who were martyred here — and widely scattered in farmland, are the remains of Górtis (Gortyn), capital of the island during the Roman era (from 65 b.c.) and also an important city in Minoan times. [SEP] Górtis is such a huge site — at its height it had a population of 300,000 — that you will see signposts to remains lying in the midst of crops south of the modern road. [SEP] By all means, stop to enjoy them, or leave the car in the village and	walk	around. [SEP] You’ll be well-rewarded, with ancient columns resting against olive trees, shards of pottery among the grass blades, and a Governor’s palace and amphitheatre to explore. [SEP] Stop at the Byzantine church in the village — you’ll find stone from the ancient site used here too — and see the stone execution block of the martyrs. [SEP] Their tomb can be viewed through the gate of a nearby crypt. [SEP] The main site (the one with the admission fee) covers only a tiny part of the whole, but it protects one of the most important archaeological finds on the island — the Code of Laws dating from the Dorian period, around 500 b.c. The huge stone tablet was incised with script dictating codes governing daily life including rules on marriage, property, and inheritance rights.

[SEP] Stop in Ágios Geórgios to visit the Folklore Museum and look for the remnants of hundreds of small windmills that once powered water pumps. [SEP] Now only a few still turn in the breeze, and irrigation is more high-tech. [SEP] On the southern edge of the plain is a large cave said to be the birthplace of Zeus — the Dictean Cave (Dictéon Ántron). [SEP] Though no proof can be put forward for this claim, from the ancient votives left in the cave it was certainly very important during Minoan times. [SEP] It is a 15-minute	walk	from the parking lot, or you can take a mule ride up the narrow path. [SEP] Be aware that the surface underfoot is very slippery, and take a flashlight for better visibility. [SEP] The cave drops precipitously 65 m (213 ft) into a dark cavern where the imagination begins to work overtime — what demons could lurk here? [SEP] A guide will help to point out details that your untrained eye might miss — such as the monstrous face of Kronos here to eat his new offspring Zeus, and the small nipple shaped stalagmites on which the infant god is said to have suckled. [SEP] The Dictean Cave is one of Crete’s most popular excursions and is very busy in the peak of the day.

Réthymnon has also been the intellectual center of Crete throughout the ages and still boasts a School of Philosophy. [SEP] In August each year it draws intellectuals and artists from across Greece for a Renaissance Festival. [SEP] The Old Town occupies a strategic position on a nub of land jutting out from the long flat coastline. [SEP] A huge fortress — the Fortezza — dominates the site, its walls rising high above the streets on the northwestern point. [SEP] This is thought to be the largest fortification ever built by the Venetians, who completed the task in 1586. [SEP] The finest views of the walls are from the promenade on the waterfront. [SEP] As you	walk	you can truly appreciate its grand scale. [SEP] Once inside it is easy to imagine a large garrison and its entourage being based here, though there are few buildings left to explore. [SEP] There is a small, whitewashed Orthodox chapel and the remains of barracks and arsenals. [SEP] Ottoman forces made surprisingly light work of taking the fortress in 1646. [SEP] They worshipped in a large mosque in the center of the fortress, whose interior you can explore. [SEP] Perhaps the most exciting part of the tour is the view over Réthymnon old town from the parapets on the eastern side — myriad tiled rooftops lead down to the harbor beyond. [SEP] There are also views east and west along the bay.

[SEP] You can take boat trips to the island of Gávdos, the most southern territory in Europe, and to Loutró, a picturesque village with no vehicular access; or head inland on foot for Loutró and the remains of ancient Anópoli for an enjoyable day’s hiking. [SEP] Heading north by road once more, your journey will take you through the spectacular Imbros Gorge with its recently released population of Bald Eagles (among other birds of prey).

[SEP] The highest range on Crete, with several of its peaks breaking 2,000 m (5600 ft), there are no villages in its shadow because the mountains rise steeply with no perceptible foothills. [SEP] This is an untamed landscape, rugged and stunningly beautiful, with narrow valleys incised between limestone peaks that wear a mantle of snow until the early summer months. [SEP] Yet in spite of this the mountains host one of Crete’s most impressive, popular, and enjoyable excursions — the 16-km- (10-mile-)	walk	down the Samariá Gorge. [SEP] The gorge is the longest in Europe and starts in the heart of the mountains at a mighty 3,352 m (11,000 ft). [SEP] In winter its path carries melted water from the peaks above. [SEP] Only in the mild conditions of summer, when the torrent turns to a trickle, are people allowed to follow its path. [SEP] The journey brings home the true power and wonder of nature. [SEP] High walls of stone, ancient cypress trees, rare orchids, and soaring birds of prey can all be seen, along with glimpses of the wild Cretan goat — the kri-kri — bounding between precipitous crags.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] The freshwater pools are inviting, but swimming is strictly forbidden. [SEP] The abandoned village of Samariá, with its 14th-century church of Ossia Maria (Mary’s Bones), marks the halfway point. [SEP] People lived here until 1962; now there’s only a warden’s post and first-aid station. [SEP] Beyond is the gorge’s narrowest point, the Sideróportes (Iron Gates), only 3.5 m (11 ft) wide but 300 m (1,000 feet) high, a truly humbling sight and the most memorable, for from here the gorge opens up as it approaches the sea and is much less striking.

[SEP] Wandering round the compact castle, you’ll understand why, for lack of space, the belfry had to be built outside, and why the picturesque old cemetery is so small. [SEP] From Guadalest, the road leads to the small town of Callosa de Ensarriá, centre of the honey industry, where you can taste before you buy, often six or eight different flavours. [SEP] From Callosa take the Parcent road, follow it for 21⁄2 km (11⁄2 miles), and make a right-hand turn at the entrance to the El Algar waterfalls, a tumbling oasis beneath the massive Sierra Bernia formed by a tributary of the River Guadalest. [SEP] Leave your car in the parking area and	walk	to the 27-metre (80-foot) falls. [SEP] You can swim beneath them in chilly waters, then picnic by the cool, leafy pools above. [SEP] It’s easy to get away from crowds in this pleasant spot, but if you’re in the mood for company, you’ll find lots of people in the restaurants near the car park. [SEP] The next stop is Tárbena (10 km/6 miles farther along the C-3318), an invigorating mountain village famed for its delicious sausages.

[SEP] At its eastern end, primary-colored buildings — a showcase of tragic splendor — seem to fall apart before your eyes. [SEP] Havana’s youth congregate along the Malecón on fine evenings, flying kites, necking, swimming off the rocks, and setting out to sea in giant inner tubes to fish. [SEP] Although most visitors will want to concentrate on historic and museum-like Old Havana, the newer districts provide a fascinating view of the areas where most people live and work. [SEP] The most interesting districts of New Havana are Central Havana and Vedado. [SEP] The former is a congested, lower-middle-class barrio with few attractions for visitors, although a	walk	along its dusty streets and crumbling façades can be an eye-opening experience. [SEP] Vedado is the city’s principal commercial and residential zone — the epicenter of middle-class Havana — with parks, monuments, hotels, restaurants, theaters, and the University of Havana. [SEP] Once the stomping grounds of the elite in the 1950s, the “suburb” of Miramar today is home to the offices of rich foreign companies investing in Cuba and the diplomatic missions of foreign governments.

Business is centered on La Rampa, the name for Calle 23 from Calle L to the sea. [SEP] Opposite the tower-block Hotel Habana Libre — the Havana Hilton in pre-revolutionary days — is the Coppelia ice cream park. [SEP] At this institution, locals queue for hours for the prized ice cream, eating several scoops in one sitting or ladling them into saucepans to take home. [SEP] Hard-hearted foreigners paying in dollars down their scoops in a cordoned-off area. [SEP] Coppelia was instrumental in the award-winning Cuban film Fresa y Chocolate (“Strawberry and Chocolate”), a daring film about freedoms and revolutionary fervor in contemporary Havana (its title is a wry reference to the lack of choices of ice cream flavors — indeed, of all things — in Cuba). [SEP] A short	walk	up the hill brings you to the University of Havana, founded in the early 18th century, a quiet, attractive campus of neoclassical buildings. [SEP] English-speaking students eager to meet foreigners are numerous here. [SEP] Directly east on Calle San Miguel, between Calles Ronda and Mazón, is the fine and surprising Museo Napoleónico. [SEP] The mansion boasts not only Empire furniture but also a remarkable collection of Napoleonic memorabilia: busts, portraits, and even his pistol, hat, and death mask from St. Helena. [SEP] The house and contents were acquired by the state from a rich owner in 1960. [SEP] In the same year, the government acquired the Museo de Artes Decorativas, at Calle 17 between Calles D and E. Each room in this grand 19th-century villa is furnished in a particular style: 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
A dashing equine statue of Agramonte forms the centerpiece of Parque Agramonte, just to the south. [SEP] The cathedral occupies one side of the park, and the Casa de la Trova (see page 82), around a floral patio, features musical performances afternoon and evening. [SEP] A ten-minute	walk	west down Calle Cristo brings you to a dignified 18th-century church, Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje (Christ of Good Travels), perfectly named for out-of-town visitors. [SEP] Behind the church is a great sea of crosses and marble saints in a picturesque cemetery; church officials claim it is wholly unrelated to travels that didn’t go so well. [SEP] A few blocks north, the Convento de Nuestra Señora del Carmen (from the early 19th century) was in a disastrous state in early 2000, though workers were busily rebuilding it. [SEP] Just enough of the structure remains to make plain that it would be stunning if carefully restored. [SEP] Camagüey’s finest feature — and marvelously restored — is Plaza San Juan de Dios, an angular old cobblestoned square surrounded by brightly hued, single-story buildin	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
en de la Caridad (Virgin of Charity). [SEP] According to legend, Cuba’s patron saint was rescued bobbing in the sea in the 17th century by three young fishermen about to capsize in a storm. [SEP] With the wooden statue in their grasp, they miraculously made it to shore. [SEP] Pilgrims, often making the last of the trek on their knees, pray to her image and place mementos and offerings of thanks for her miracles; among them are small boats and prayers for those who have tried to escape Cuba on rafts. [SEP] The Virgen is on the second floor, encased in glass and cloaked in a glittering gold robe. [SEP] You can take a taxi to El Cobre for around US$15 roundtrip, although more adventurous sorts can hop a máquina (vintage American automobile taxi) or colectivo (bus or truck) out to the town and	walk	the mile or so to the church. [SEP] If you’d like to stay overnight in this spectacular (and deathly peaceful) area, there is a hostal, Hospedería de la Caridad, behind the church, where foreigners who abide by the strict rules can stay for a mere five pesos a night (see page 133). [SEP] East of Santiago is Parque Baconao, a biosphere reserve spread over 40 km (25 miles). [SEP] The local dark-sand beaches can be scrubby and the hotels themselves are isolated, but there’s lots to explore in the park, and the Sierra de La Gran Piedra rise majestically above the coast.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
are milked, and millet is threshed by pounding the stalks on the threshing floor. [SEP] Women and girls troop to and from water taps with their water jars, while small children rock babies slung in baskets under the thatched eaves of stone-walled houses. [SEP] Grain is taken to water-driven mills for grinding, or in some cases is ground between two flat stones or pounded in a mortar by a foot-operated rocker-beam pestle. [SEP] In recent years numerous hydroelectric projects throughout the Annapurna and Solu-Khumbu regions have brought moderately reliable electricity to remote villages. [SEP] However, this electricity is usually only available for a few hours in the evening. [SEP] With electricity available, it is now possible to watch CNN (via satellite dish) from a remote lodge many days’	walk	from the nearest road. [SEP] If you are trekking in the Annapurna region, you will at times have to give way to caravans of ponies, mules, and donkeys crowned with red and white yak-tail plumes. [SEP] In the Khumbu region, it will be caravans of yaks themselves (or yak-cow cross breeds) carrying the packs. [SEP] Give the yaks a wide berth, and always stay on the uphill side of the trail as they pass.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Solu-Khumbu: the Everest region (5 days–3 weeks). [SEP] The shortest possible trek for a close view of Mount Everest and Sherpa country in Sagarmatha National Park is a five-day dash with round-trip flights between Kathmandu and Lukla. [SEP] The trail goes up the Dudh Kosi river valley through lovely woodlands with an overnight at Phakding or Jorsale. [SEP] The next night is at Namche Bazaar, where there is a Sherpa market on Saturdays. [SEP] Return is by the same route with an added night at Lukla to be on hand for one of the (often cancelled) early morning flights back. [SEP] Add two days for the interesting switchback	walk	from Namche to the Thyangboche Monastery and back, or ten days for the circuit that goes on to Pheriche, Lobuje, Gorak Shep, and Kala Patar for one of the greatest of all Himalayan views. [SEP] It is also possible to continue on to the Everest Base Camp area at an exhausting 5,360 m (17,586 ft), although there is not much to see at base camp (no view of Everest). [SEP] Add another week (for a total of 20 to 21 days) if you hike in from Jiri (reachable from Kathmandu by bus or taxi) and then fly out of Lukla.

Turn right at this intersection, and then left where two lions flank a passage leading to a striking white Buddhist stupa in a large courtyard. [SEP] This is the Kathesimbhu temple, built in the mid-17th century in the style of Swayambhunath (see page 42) as a service to devotees physically unable to climb up to that hilltop shrine. [SEP] There are several masterpieces of sculpture here, as well as a bahal, or monastery, one of 120 tucked away in courtyards of the city. [SEP] At this point, continuing to Thahiti Tole, where there is another small stupa, you can	walk	north to the main intersection of Thamel, Kathmandu’s lively, fast-spreading center for budget-conscious tourists. [SEP] Guest houses, restaurants, curio vendors, rug shops, trekking agencies, bicycle and motorcycle rental stands, and bookshops line the way. [SEP] Some guest houses have pleasant gardens, and most are clean and quite inexpensive, though in recent years more expensive hotels have also opened in this neighborhood. [SEP] Many low-budget guest houses have bulletin boards where trekkers leave messages for friends or advertise for trekking companions. [SEP] From Thamel’s center you can return to your starting point by heading right, or east, to a roundabout. [SEP] Back in the modern part of town you come to the Kaiser Library.

he world, an immense white mound surmounted by a golden cube, on the four sides of which are the astonishing all-seeing eyes of Buddha. [SEP] Above this rises a tower of 13 diminishing golden disks symbolizing the 13 steps to enlightenment, then a golden royal parasol topped by a bell-shaped crown. [SEP] Strings of prayer flags stretch from the tower’s pinnacle, and around the base are hundreds of small prayer wheels. [SEP] While pilgrims circumambulate the stupa, monkeys, dogs, and pigeons clamber about and forage for scraps of food offerings in small altars set in the foundation. [SEP] The typical Nepali mix of Hinduism and Buddhism is almost immediately in evidence. [SEP] At the top of the stairs stands a huge dorje, the tantric thunderbolt symbol. [SEP] To the left of this (remember to	walk	clockwise around the stupa) rise two shikara-style votive towers to Hindu deities. [SEP] On the side of the stupa opposite the stairs is a very popular pagoda temple to Hariti Devi, a Hindu goddess who protects against smallpox and children’s diseases. [SEP] This temple, too, has Buddhist prayer wheels around it, worn shiny by the hands of the devout. [SEP] Adjacent to this temple, within a cage to prevent their theft, are two images alternately described as the White Tara and the Green Tara (Buddhist deities) and as Ganga and Jamuna (Hindu deities). [SEP] A bronze peacock accompanies these two figures. [SEP] There is a small forest of white chaitya shrines behind the Hariti Devi temple, and a porch to one side where pilgrims congregate to prepare meals in offering for the goddess.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Duck through a low passage between two shops across the street to find the Til Mahadev Narayan Temple. [SEP] It stands in an un-touristy rubble-filled square where there are families washing, goats looking out of upstairs windows, and, behind a grill in a small kiosk, a lingam much venerated by older women, who keep it covered with flowers. [SEP] Bhaktapur expanded over the centuries from a nucleus around the Tachupal Tole, reached by a	walk	from the Nyatapola Temple through narrow streets full of unfamiliar merchandise: the lengths of red yarn are sold to be plaited in women’s hair; the gray cannonballs are homemade soap, the conical yellowish cigarettes are bidi, the cheapest tobacco, and can be bought singly. [SEP] There will be heaps of orange turmeric, cardamom, ginger, and other spices, and bundles of dried fish, looking like twigs. [SEP] Pan sellers offer to mix lime, spices, and bits of nuts and tobacco in a fresh betel-leaf packet for chewing. [SEP] Bigger leaves stuck together with bamboo toothpicks are sold as plates for temple offerings. [SEP] Many of the old houses around Tachupal Tole have been very carefully restored.

From Kathmandu, short trips to the valley rim make it possible for those with limited time to see the high mountains at sunrise or sunset. [SEP] Nagarkot, which stands on the crest of a ridge at 2,195 m (7,200 ft), is about an hour’s drive from Bhaktapur and one of the best places in the Kathmandu area for viewing the Himalayas. [SEP] From this aerie on the rim of the Kathmandu Valley, 322 km (200 miles) of the Himalayas stretch out before you in an immense wall of rock and ice. [SEP] Although there are excellent views from the many lodges and hotels here, the view is even better from a nearby observation tower, which can be reached in about an hour’s	walk	from Nagarkot. [SEP] From this observation tower, it is possible to see as far as Mount Everest. [SEP] Most visitors come for the sunrise or sunset on the mountains, and though the weather is often at its clearest in the early morning, low clouds and fog often obstruct the view. [SEP] The Kathmandu area’s other popular mountain-viewing spot is the village of Dhulikhel, which has a view very similar to that from Nagarkot and is a bit easier to reach, since it is on the main highway to Tibet. [SEP] This highway passes through Banepa, where you can turn off to visit Panauti. [SEP] The buildings here have great artistic and historic importance and for this reason have become the focus of a French-funded restoration project.

[SEP] On the airport side of town, there are several luxury hotels, and one of these, on the lake itself, is reached by a hand-drawn ferry. [SEP] This is a starting and ending point for trekkers, and as such is filled with a mix of people in anxious anticipation of their impending adventure and those who have recently returned from exhausting treks. [SEP] Everyone seems content to fill up on cakes and pies. [SEP] Day hikes are a popular activity here, with the most popular hike being that to Sarangkot to see Dhaulagiri and the Annapurnas from the viewing tower.

Montmartre Montmartre is really a hilltop village (“La Butte” to its residents), with narrow, winding streets and dead-ends. [SEP] For the last 200 years it has been associated with artists and bohemians. [SEP] The Montmartrobus spares you the	walk	and shows you some of the area in a single tour, but the best way to discover Montmartre at your own pace is to start early, at the top. [SEP] Take the métro to Abbesses and the elevator to the street (the stairs here are endless) and notice the handsome Art Nouveau entrance as you leave. [SEP] Rue Yvonne le Tac leads to the base station of a funicular railway. [SEP] It was here that St. Denis was martyred (see page 13) and where St. Ignatius Loyola launched the Jesuit movement in 1534. [SEP] The funicular (it takes métro and bus tickets) climbs to the terrace in front of the Byzantine-style basilica of Sacré-Cœur. [SEP] Standing at the highest point in Paris, it’s one of the city’s principal landmarks, and one of the few to remain perennially controversial.

[SEP] All the way east to place Pigalle and beyond runs a ribbon of tawdry nightlife, with sex shops, peep shows, and other dubious attractions, punctuated by a few conventional restaurants and bars. [SEP] By evening, tour buses from all over Europe are parked bumper to bumper. [SEP] Avoid the late-night métro here, unless you want to share it with reeling drunks. [SEP] The principal cemetery of Montmartre, where luminaries of the arts such as the composers Berlioz and Offenbach lie buried, may seem a world away, but it’s only a short	walk	west from the Moulin Rouge to the entrance (west past the Moulin Rouge, then right at avenue Rachel).

Geographically if not temperamentally part of the Left Bank, the Palais-Bourbon is the seat of the Assemblée Nationale (parliament). [SEP] Designed for a daughter of Louis XIV in 1722, it makes a stately riverside façade for the 7th arrondissement, with its 18th-century embassies, ministries, and private mansions (hôtels particuliers). [SEP] Napoléon added the Grecian columns facing the Pont de la Concorde, but the palace is more graceful seen from its entrance on the south side. [SEP] Access is available only on written request or invitation by a deputy. [SEP] A privileged few get to see the great Délacroix paintings in the library, illustrating the history of civilization. [SEP] The Prime Minister’s splendid residence, Hôtel Matignon at 57 rue de Varenne, is a short	walk	from the National Assembly. [SEP] Its private park has a music pavilion favored for secret strategy sessions. [SEP] On the same elegant 18th-century street, the Musée Rodin at number 77 houses the sculptor’s works in the delightful Hôtel Biron (see page 75). [SEP] Most important sight in the neighborhood is the monumental Hôtel des Invalides, established by Louis XIV as the first national hospital and retirement home for soldiers wounded in action. [SEP] At one time it housed approximately 6,000 veterans, but Napoléon took over a large part of it for the Musée de l’Armée (Army Museum). [SEP] Then the Invalides came to symbolize the glory of Napoléon himself, when his remains were finally brought back from St. Helena in 1840 for burial in the chapel under the golden Dôme.

Perched on the edge of the Bairro Alto is one of Lisbon’s most evocative sights, the shell of the 14th-century Igreja do Carmo, which was packed with worshippers on All Saints’ Day, 1755, when the terrible earthquake brought the roof down. [SEP] The church remains deliberately preserved as an atmospheric ruin. [SEP] Nearby, the sumptuous 16th-century Igreja de São Roque features a lavish baroque chapel of São João Baptista (St. John the Baptist) and a small museum of sacred art. [SEP] You can easily	walk	to the Bairro Alto from the central squares in the Baixa, but it’s also fun to go by tram or board the landmark 30-m (98-ft) Elevador de Santa Justa, which you’ll find just off Rossio square. [SEP] The stately elevator, a 1902 Victorian marvel of iron and glass, was built by Raul Mesnier (not Gustave Eiffel, as many continue to believe).

[SEP] The elegant formal Palace Gardens are laid out with an array of baroque statues, sculpted hedges, fountains, and pools. [SEP] The nearby Miradouro de São Gens affords a good view of the city.

[SEP] The streets are too narrow for cars, but a short	walk	to the castle at the top is worth the effort for the impressive stonework and the view.

r, take at least a couple of days. [SEP] Enjoying a rest in a shady plaza or taking a long lunch at an outdoor café are just as much a part of your trip as a tour around the museums. [SEP] San Juan is a living city, and it’s especially bustling after dark, when crowds throng to the bars and restaurants or simply stroll the narrow streets and airy plazas. [SEP] Begin your exploration at Plaza de Colón (Columbus Square). [SEP] If you take a taxi from the outlying resort areas, this is a good place to alight — before traffic in the narrow streets forces your vehicle to a halt.

After visiting the fort continue west along Boulevard del Valle, which becomes Calle Norzagaray. [SEP] Here you’ll be tempted by fine views of the sea; you may even catch sight of a cruise ship sailing gracefully into port. [SEP] This route sits against the old city walls, which were completed in 1785, and from here it is easy to see why the city was thought to be impregnable. [SEP] Thanks to the high, thick walls and the watch-towers with their distinctive rounded roofs, the residents could be sure that no one would approach unseen. [SEP] After a	walk	of about half a mile you’ll find the plain façade of the Museo de Arte e Historia (San Juan Museum of Art and History) on your left. [SEP] Once a major market place for the city, built in 1855, the building now houses a major collection of Puerto Rican art. [SEP] Just past the museum, a large, open grassy area comes into view. [SEP] If you happen to be here on a weekend you’ll find thousands of Puerto Rican families out flying kites. [SEP] This area is the best place to take advantage of the sea breezes, and many kites soar hundreds of feet up in the air.

Behind the museum are a number of other important attractions. [SEP] Take Calle las Monjas toward San Juan Bay. [SEP] After a short distance you’ll arrive at the western wall and a small square, Plazuela de la Rogativa, with a bronze statue commemorating the torchlight religious procession, or rogativa, that saved the city in 1797. [SEP] It’s believed that the lights held by the bishop and the women of the city fooled the British forces in the bay into assuming that Spanish reinforcements had arrived. [SEP] The British fled empty-handed. [SEP] Just a short	walk	north of the square is the Casa Blanca (White House), which for 250 years was the home of the descendants of Ponce de León. [SEP] Something of a mini-fortress, safe behind its own high wall, the house itself is fascinating — the interior is a museum to life in 16th- and 17th-century San Juan, with many rooms full of period furniture. [SEP] Walk back toward the Plazuela de la Rogativa and peer over the city wall, which rises over 100 ft (301⁄2 m) at this point. [SEP] The plain façade is broken by the San Juan Gate, which was once the only entrance to the city from the old port. [SEP] The gate was constructed in 1639, and the walls were completed in 1641. [SEP] Every person who traveled across the Atlantic from Spain would enter through this narrow passage — many would make their way directly	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Take a left and a block farther down you’ll enter Plaza de Armas. [SEP] This was the first central square of Old San Juan, and the City Hall, or Alcaldía, still sits on its northern side. [SEP] The army used to drill here, hence the name (armas means weapons, or arms), but today it is simply a place for people to meet and have a coffee, or sit and chat. [SEP] Workers enjoy picnic lunches here at midday; old people while away the afternoon. [SEP] The Alcaldía has an interesting interior, with checkerboard marble floors and magnificent chandeliers. [SEP] It’s usually open on weekdays; you can check with the tourist information office on the ground floor as to whether it’s OK to wander around. [SEP] Back on Calle Fortaleza,	walk	east until you reach the Casa de Callejón (House of the Alley) on the corner of Callejón de Capilla. [SEP] A fine example of an 18th-century house, it is now the Museum of the Puerto Rican Family, full of the furniture, toys, and other daily artifacts of a well-to-do San Juan family. [SEP] Taking a left out of the museum brings you back to Plaza Colón, from where you can make your way south toward San Juan harbor. [SEP] Along the way you’ll pass Teatro Tapia (Tapia Theater) named after Puerto Rican playwright Alejandro Tapia y Rivera. [SEP] The splendid façade was restored in 1976, the interior remodeled in 1987. [SEP] The theater hosts regular performances of ballet, dance, and drama, often showcasing works by modern Puerto Rican writers and choreographers.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
Arriving via Route 191 you’ll come right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park. [SEP] This facility presents important information about the history of the park, its plant and animal species, and its role in the local ecology. [SEP] You can then travel on higher into the park, toward the summit. [SEP] You can’t drive the whole 8 miles (13 km) between the visitors center and the end of the road, but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way, so there’s ample access. [SEP] Two popular stops are La Coca Falls, on the right after the 5-mile (8-km) point, and the Yokahú Observation Tower, at the 51⁄2-mile (9-km) point. [SEP] Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes. [SEP] The most spectacular cascade in the park, La Mina Falls, is just a 30-minute	walk	from the roadside, via Big Tree Trail.

Culebra, much smaller at 21 sq miles (34 sq km), is north of Vieques. [SEP] It is the largest rock in a collection of over twenty that attract sailors and divers from the main island. [SEP] Culebra was known as the Spanish Virgin Island until the American takeover — it lies halfway between Puerto Rico and St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. [SEP] Its only town is named Dewey, after Admiral George Dewey, a hero of the American-Spanish War of 1898. [SEP] The local people are more apt to call it Pueblo. [SEP] Culebra is full of natural beauty: beaches (Flamenco is the most celebrated), clear waters full of marine life, and land awash with flowers. [SEP] Most people come just to sit on the beach or	walk	in the fresh air. [SEP] Much of the island is now managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, to preserve the environment. [SEP] It makes an interesting day trip from Puerto Rico and a total contrast to hot days in the streets of Old San Juan.

 [SEP] Ponce is a thriving port city, very modern in many ways, but it lives up to its name of “Pearl of the South.” [SEP] At the very heart of the city is a jewel of an old town, well-preserved thanks to a massive and expensive restoration program begun in the 1980s. [SEP] Hundreds of careworn buildings were brought back to life, and power cables were buried underground and out of sight. [SEP] Along with this physical transformation came a cultural change: Ponce has become a focus for social events that celebrate Puerto Rican history and tradition; several major festivals are held here throughout the year. [SEP] The focus of the city is Parque Degetau in Plaza Las Delicias (Delight Square), known by most locals as Plaza de Ponce. [SEP] Most of what you want to see is within a few minutes’	walk	of this plaza, and cafés and restaurants for refreshments are also near at hand. [SEP] You can spend a wonderful morning just soaking in the atmosphere. [SEP] The park, with its shady trees, cooling fountains, and somber bronze statues, including one of Luis Muñoz Marín, is where people come to take a break from the midday heat. [SEP] There’s also a good ice-cream shop on the east side of the square. [SEP] At the heart of the square is the Cathedral of our Lady of Guadalupe, the city’s main place of worship since the late 1600s. [SEP] Steady streams of visitors step inside to light a candle. [SEP] Behind the cathedral is perhaps the most famous building in the city, the Parque de Bombas.

ays, but if you arrive midweek or out of season, you may find that you are the only visitors. [SEP] South of Boquerón you leave the world behind. [SEP] Make your way along Route 301 towards Cabo Rojo and the lighthouse at the southwest tip of the island to really enjoy natural Puerto Rico. [SEP] Fishing is the main way people make a living here — between mangrove outcrops are many small shacks with boats tied up to rickety wooden jetties. [SEP] The salt flats that you see are still harvested commercially. [SEP] Eventually, the tarmac stops and the road changes to a simple dirt track. [SEP] The surface is reasonable, so don’t worry about continuing on. [SEP] You’ll travel over a narrow bridge and enter a section of the Bosque Estatal de Boquerón. [SEP] Leave you car below the lighthouse and	walk	up the hill to reach it (a five-minute	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
 to the waterfront. [SEP] A series of narrow alleys are filled with craft, clothing, and jewelry shops, along with cafés and restaurants that provide welcome relief once you’ve become “shopped out.” [SEP] But Charlotte Amalie is not just a shopper’s paradise. [SEP] There are historic gems to be discovered here as well. [SEP] Perhaps the most prominent is Fort Christian, which sits to the east of downtown. [SEP] Work on the fort began in 1671, to protect the harbor. [SEP] The terra-cotta walls, pretty painted shutters, and crenellated clock tower give the building a cozy rather than a fearsome look. [SEP] The interior has been transformed into a museum of life in the US Virgin Islands: colonial furniture, archive documents, and old photographs of the islands, people, and towns. [SEP] Take a	walk	onto the walls of the fort for a wonderful view over the seafront and the colorful Vendors Plaza, a craft market under bright parasols that has a permanent home in the fort’s shadow. [SEP] Next to the fort is the pretty Legislature building with a classical façade painted bright lime green. [SEP] Finished in 1874, the building was originally used as a barracks for troops based at the fort. [SEP] Behind the fort and the Vendors Plaza is Emancipation Park, perhaps the one place in town where you can sit in the shade of the trees and enjoy the cooling sea breeze after your sightseeing and shopping. [SEP] The park was named to commemorate the freeing of the slaves in 1848. [SEP] Across Tolbod Gade is the Tourist Information Office, where you can pick up maps and other information.

Perhaps one of the most beautiful and unusual buildings in Charlotte Amalie is the St. Thomas Synagogue, on Crystal Gade. [SEP] This is the oldest synagogue building in continual use under the American flag. [SEP] The Jewish congregation has always been strong here, from the very earliest days of Danish settlement in 1655. [SEP] When the all-consuming fire of 1831 broke out, 64 families were worshipping in the small synagogue. [SEP] Only one scroll could be saved before the flames destroyed the building. [SEP] The present structure was built on the same spot and opened in 1833. [SEP] The synagogue has sand on the floor, symbolic of the Jewish flight from Egypt. [SEP] The cruise port is situated at the West Indian Company Dock, a mile or so east of town. [SEP] The thirty-minute	walk	around the harbor is pleasant if the traffic is not too busy. [SEP] Those who want to ride will find numerous taxis waiting to take them to and from Charlotte Amalie. [SEP] The dock is one of the largest, and busiest, in the Caribbean. [SEP] Old Danish warehouses along the dockside have been transformed in recent years, creating Havensight Shopping Mall. [SEP] Over 80 tax-free boutiques with cafés and restaurants sit only feet away from the huge ships. [SEP] You will also find the ticket office for Atlantis Submarine in the Havensight Mall. [SEP] This mini-submarine, which seats around thirty, takes you some 60 ft (18 m) under the sea to view coral reefs and the marine life that inhabits them. [SEP] A ferry takes you out to Buck Island some 3 miles (5 km) offshore to rendezvous with the sub	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	1
