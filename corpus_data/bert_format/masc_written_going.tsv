Dear David Hardy, It is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been	going	on in the United States since the release of his last documentary. [SEP] In a time of simple-minded patriotism, loud, clear and dissenting voices like Mr. Moore's are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced, partially through well funded public relations campaigns, partially through conservative "grass-roots" propaganda. [SEP] Not surprisingly, much of the criticism of Moore's film is misguided or outright wrong, often vastly more inaccurate than Moore's work itself. [SEP] Moore portrays the NRA as an unethical, dishonest organization; he sees the paranoia and fear in the United States as a primary cause of violence, and he does not see gun ownership itself as a problem. [SEP] His documentary is full of subtle humor, jaw-dropping dialogue and dark contrasts. [SEP] All in all, it is 	#essays#	essays_A_defense_of_Michael_Moore.txt	go	written	masc_written	2

That, & your boarding pass is sticking out of your pocket with the airline’s name facing out.” [SEP] I laughed.

[SEP] You wouldn't believe half of the shit I've seen, even when I was straight. [SEP] It was a Friday night.

ety. You see, Nathan, there is …separate from your society …oh, damn it. I’ve never had to give this conversation before. Come on, I have something to show you.” [SEP] With that, he made a sharp turn onto a side street that I hadn’t noticed before. [SEP] We drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that I couldn’t tell whether they were abandoned. [SEP] My driver turned again next to an old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year. [SEP] In front of a few houses, there were cars parked, but there were almost none on the streets. [SEP] Their bumpers looked ready to drop off, and their paint was half smog. [SEP] I got a strange feeling that we weren’t supposed to be driving here. [SEP] “Hey,” I said, “are you sure that we should be	going	this way? I mean – ” “Just ignore that,” he told me. [SEP] “You’ll be used to the sensation in a moment.” [SEP] That just unnerved me more. [SEP] As we kept driving, the anxiety grew more pronounced. [SEP] I noticed that there were some people on the street, people the same color as the soiled buildings. [SEP] Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes. [SEP] “Okay, this is the spot,” said my driver, pulling over. [SEP] He parked and got out.	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	go	written	masc_written	2
Holding Dvorov’s directions, Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway. [SEP] I started wondering again how reliable my guide’s credentials were. [SEP] Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other, he did not inspire confidence. [SEP] “Just at this corner,” he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, “we’re	going	to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east. East is that way.” [SEP] He pointed at the wall to our right. [SEP] “Don’t let the sun fool you. Then I’m	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	go	written	masc_written	2
“Oh, thanks, Nepthys, for your confidence-inspiring tales of experience. So they’re probably worse than we think, okay, that’s great. Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an Anne Rice novel?” “My plan is that you shut up while we’re trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what we’re actually	going	up against. Okay? Don’t forget, she’s your girlfriend. Now calm down while I talk to this gentleman. I can hear your heartbeat from over here.” [SEP] I shut up and tried to breathe. [SEP] Nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed, who had not moved. [SEP] “Please, accept our apologies. As you can see, our situation is of personal importance to the young man. Now: may we ask you a few questions about an individual we believe to be a vampire? It would be a great help to us.”	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	go	written	masc_written	2
We hit a bar on the next street over. [SEP] “Vodka, straight up,” Nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter, “and a Bloody Mary for my friend. Make it extra bloody.” [SEP] When our drinks came, he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my Bloody Mary. [SEP] “That should help,” he said. [SEP] “You could run on empty with a little of that stuff. It won’t refill your blood supply, but while that’s in your system, you won’t even need blood.” [SEP] He grinned at me. [SEP] “Drink up, kid.” [SEP] I took about half of the Bloody Mary in one gulp and then ate the celery. [SEP] Nepthys slapped me on the back. [SEP] “Okay,” I said, “now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s	going	on here? I mean, what is this place, really?” [SEP] He thought about that. [SEP] “I think that our world is a reflection of yours, or yours is a more boring reflection of ours. This place is just a little of both. In America, things are still weird after the European conquest. The natives are still here, but so is everyone else. The Europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities. We aren’t quite what you’d expect from reading the Grimms.”	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	go	written	masc_written	2
“My parents came over from Russia, just like your family. My real name is a little more ethnically appropriate, but we don’t toss those around in this place. They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary. When the Russian government dammed the river, my parents decided that instead of dying with the river, they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected. I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river. Sure, I miss having a place to settle down, but it’s better than waiting to get dammed.” [SEP] He took another shot of vodka. [SEP] “Shouldn’t you be	going	light on the vodka? I mean, we might have a lot of work ahead of us.” “Are you kidding? I can drink like a fish, kid. We should get	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	go	written	masc_written	2
We left. [SEP] Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck. [SEP] “You idiot,” he hissed, “do you know how much you’ve set us back? I should say, set yourself back, since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for.” [SEP] I thought about Rachel; in the excitement, I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts. [SEP] “You’re just lucky that Dvorov isn’t my only contact. Come on, we’re heading out.” [SEP] He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs. [SEP] Walking outside, I was shocked to see that it was already dark. [SEP] “Night comes quickly here,” said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me. [SEP] “Didn’t I warn you?” “Okay,” he said as we hit the street, “we’re	going	to see another friend of mine. First, though, we are getting you a hat. You look ridiculous with a shaved head.” [SEP] At a nearby stand, he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston. [SEP] It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front. [SEP] Amy liked it, I think. [SEP] She still hadn’t spoken since I named her, so I wasn’t sure. [SEP] He took us to a squat, long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal. [SEP] The black door opened as we came up to it, and a pale man opened the door. [SEP] He was naked, but there was nothing to hide: his body was hairless and completely smooth. [SEP] I only say “he” because he didn’t have a hint of femininity. [SEP] His eyes were white. [SEP] From behind him, I 	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	go	written	masc_written	2
“She may be at that,” said Isis, gazing at her. [SEP] “That sweet, small nose, and her soft lips – she’d kiss well, I should think, if gently. She has good blood under her cheeks. Good, round breasts, too, even though they’re small, they suit her.” [SEP] Amy didn’t blush, and I hoped that she didn’t understand what Isis was saying. [SEP] “She would have been worth it,” Nepthys interrupted, “if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact. He was	going	to give us valuable information for her.” “Now I understand why you’re here,” said Isis. [SEP] “So what do you need to know?”	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	go	written	masc_written	2
Nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall. [SEP] When we got there, another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood. [SEP] He offered it to Nepthys, who opened the box: on velvet lining, a wooden hammer and two stakes. [SEP] “Mountain ash,” said Nepthys. [SEP] “That was very kind of her.” [SEP] Closing the box, he paused beside the open door and looked back at me. [SEP] “I really hope we find your Rachel,” he said. [SEP] It looked like he was	going	to continue, but then he walked out the door. [SEP] “I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,” said Nepthys. [SEP] “I bet he’s kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me.” [SEP] In a few minutes, we were back to the first door we’d knocked on in this town and Dvorov himself was greeting us. [SEP] The pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart.	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	go	written	masc_written	2

Price records are being set at auctions this week. [SEP] At Christie's, a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz's "Equivalents" series sold for $396,000, a single-lot record. [SEP] Other works also have been exceeding price estimates. [SEP] In part, prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints. [SEP] This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal, says Beth Gates-Warren of Sotheby's. [SEP] "There is finally some sort of sense in the market," she says. [SEP] Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers, giving greater market stability, says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector.

A new continuity What general lessons can be claimed from our two examples? [SEP] Many would argue that traditional employment systems,	going	back to the factories of the eighteenth century, do not favour boundaryless careers. [SEP] We agree, but we also live in a time when those systems are failing, and where their underlying assumptions of stasis are incompatible with the emergent reality of persistent change. [SEP] Moreover, those systems were designed according to a conception of ‘labour capital’ rather than to one of ‘intellectual capital’. [SEP] Yet, it is the conception of intellectual capital that is increasingly emphasised today. [SEP] Readers of this chapter will most likely see themselves as having a capacity for continuous learning. [SEP] Is it really too great a step to extend the same belief in the capacity for learning to the workforce at large?
