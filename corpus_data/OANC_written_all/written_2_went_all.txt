In any case, since the 1970s, such debates about the impact of international trade policy have been placed in a new economic context. Increasingly, analysts and public policy makers discuss trade issue in terms of the emergence of a significant and growing inequality in compensation between production and nonsupervisory workers, on the one hand, and managerial, supervisory, or exempt employees and professionals on the other. These differences include a larger disparity in compensation between those highly educated and those who are not, particularly high school dropouts. In addition, there has been an appreciable growth in relatively unskilled immigrants in some localities such as major metropolitan areas around the country.4 The 1997 Economic Report of the President, reporting a colloquium of experts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, attributes the growth of inequality to the following: technological change (45 percent), international trade (12 percent), a decline in the real minimum wage (10 percent), rising immigration (8 percent), and other factors (15 percent).5<n>Although such analysis and policy discussions have not singled out specific industries, the nature of the occupational structure and workforce in textiles and apparel—particularly the latter sector—makes the general discussion relevant to these two industries. It would appear that neither the market imports of textiles nor the immigration of low-skilled workers has had an appreciable negative impact on the wages of the textile industry or its major sectors. The average hourly earnings of U.S. employees in textile mill products (SIC 22) went from $4.66 in 1979 to $10.02 in 1997—an increase of 115 percent and more than the increase in all manufacturing or nondurable manufacturing. This relative wage increase in textiles took place despite its concentration in a low-wage region—the southeastern Piedmont states—the low level of collective bargaining, and the higher-than-average percentage of women workers.<n>But the experience in apparel is less categorical, especially because of the differential impact on various branches of apparel and other textile products (SIC 23). In 1997, the average hourly earnings of apparel workers were $8.25. On the high end, automotive and apparel trimmings (SIC 2396) averaged $11.36; on the low end, women’s and misses’ blouses and skirts (SIC 2331) averaged $7.01. Correspondingly, employment in automotive and apparel trimmings increased 71.4 percent from 1979 to 1997 while in women’s and misses blouses and skirts it declined by 60.6 percent in the same period. Bear in mind, however, that blast furnaces and steel mills (SIC 3312) declined in employment from 478,500 employees in 1979 to 163,300 in 1997. This 65.9 percent decline from 1979 to 1997 compares with a 31.3 percent drop for textile mill products and 37.6 percent for all apparel workers.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch15.txt
A Dying Industry—or Not?<n>For many commentators, a book about the future of the U.S. apparel and textile industries is still an oxymoron. The conventional wisdom paints a grim picture of where these industries are headed. Low-cost labor overseas and the increasing penetration of imports have certainly undercut American apparel manufacturers; apparel imports grew rapidly in most categories starting in the mid-1970s. If we measure import penetration in physical units (rather than dollar value),12 import penetration for men’s and boys’ suits, for example, went from just 10 percent in 1973 to 43 percent by 1996. A similar expansion in imports occurred for men’s and boys’ trousers, women’s and girls’ dresses, and women’s slacks and shorts.13<n>As one consequence, the number of business failures among U.S. apparel manufacturers climbed from 227 in 1975 to a high of 567 in 1993.14 Not surprisingly, employment in the apparel sector during this period declined appreciably. And the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a further reduction in the domestic apparel industry during the period 1996 to 2006 from 864,000 workers to just 714,00015—this from an industry that employed about 1.2 million employees in 1950 and reached a peak of 1.4 million employees in 1973.16<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt
Continuing integration of the industry also contributed to the rise in productivity. Although small, family-owned and operated companies were the norm in traditional textiles, in the early 1950s leaders like Burlington Industries and Milliken undertook vertical integration to handle textile products from fiber to finishing.36 Historically, finishing operations were often undertaken by separate firms known as converters, which played a large role in the design of finished goods. Companies like Burlington integrated forward by bringing converting operations in-house, while a number of converters extended their operations backward into primary textiles.<n>Beyond restructuring for materials flow, the industry has experienced substantial horizontal integration. As a consequence, some segments of textiles, such as spinning, weaving, and knitting, became more concentrated by the late 1970s. The industry underwent another substantial restructuring in the 1980s, and product lines became even more concentrated.37 Much of this happened because less efficient firms, using older technologies, went under or were absorbed by larger survivors. Between 1977 and 1987, the number of textile establishments declined by 11 percent, from 7,202 to 6,412, and industry employment fell by nearly 25 percent. At present, the four largest firms control about 40 percent of weaving and yarn mills output, although many finishing and dyeing companies and knitting firms remain small.<n>Human Resources and Productivity Growth<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
The late Joseph Gerber, founder of Gerber Garment Technology Company in Tolland, Connecticut, invented automated fabric cutting and introduced it to the market in 1969. This innovative company went on to create a new industry in automatic-cutting equipment. By the late 1970s, Gerber Garment Technology was supplying the automotive and apparel industries with its GERBERcutter, allowing firms to cut cloth and nonwoven material more effectively. The Gerber system first made it possible for a computer to guide the cutting knife anywhere on the cutting table. Gerber’s automatic-cutting equipment, as well as that of several other international competitors, has continued to improve; cloth from a single ply to layers up to six inches thick can now be cut quickly and accurately.<n>Gerber is also a major worldwide supplier of information systems for the sewing products industries. Its Product Data Management software provides users with all the information about an apparel product, including design, patterns, markers, sewing instructions, and assembly costs. This single software package can be made available through an in-house local area network or the World Wide Web. Computer data systems like this have enormous potential for the apparel industry. Private-label apparel for U.S. department and specialty stores, for instance, is generally designed in this country and produced by domestic contractors or overseas. Regardless of geographic location, it is always difficult for a contractor to know if it has the latest information on sewing patterns and other construction details. But via a network that allows contractors access, manufacturers’ headquarters can make sure that the information available is the most recent and complete. In addition, video instructions, which do not rely on spoken language, can demonstrate to foreign contractors what is acceptable and what is not.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
Although many apparel manufacturers do have in-house designers, most of the work of garment design comes in adjusting previous -patterns or small elements of existing garments—say, the trim or the fabric—and is more a matter of technical creation than a flight of fancy. Consider the expansion of basic and fashion-basic garments in the U.S. market. For T-shirts, sweatpants, and different types of jeans, the design elements that change annually may only amount to a change of color, fit of the jeans, or the addition of a pocket to sweatpants.<n>Traditionally, a new apparel design was created by asking the designer/artist to make a watercolor sketch. If the fabric was to have a pattern, there might also be a close-up colored sketch of it. Many designs would be grouped together into a storyboard, which was then presented to managers for final decisions. Next the designs that passed this stage went through a technical design step in which details were added and patterns made. After this step, fabric might be cut and a sample made to see how it would look on a mannequin. If the new garment was a blouse, for example, the designer might wish to see how it looked with skirts planned for the collection. If the designer was not satisfied with the drape of the garment, the fit, or the pattern, he or she might go back to square one. Several iterations of these initial design steps could add weeks or months to the process before production began.<n>Although some haute couture or high-end apparel designers may still work in this manner, each year more garments are designed using computer technology. In our survey, 40 percent of the business units reported using Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) systems to prepare new products in 1992. Employing CAD was particularly common among the largest business units in our sample. The use of modern design tools and information technology can collapse the design time so that managerial decision-making becomes the longest step in the process—and even the time for that step can be shortened with information technology. The new way allows the designer to work creatively with a computer pen or brush to outline the sketch, which appears on a computer screen. The computer can “watercolor” the sketch and produce the storyboard for presentation. Once past the first steps, these systems let designers drape fabric patterns on sketches or photographs of people on the computer screen. For example, sketches or photos can be draped with material of different colors and patterns. The size of the pattern can be changed and the visual images compared to get a sense of their appeal. And a colored ink-jet printing of the pattern can be made on basic plain fabric to help identify and demonstrate the desired colors in future discussions with textile mills.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
A close look at the research reveals that children who fared well experienced eective interaction over an extended period. In studies following children from infancy into childhood and adolescence, early brief episodes of parental stimulation and sensitivity did not result in more competent children.8 Instead, positive, supportive parenting that endured, even when it marked a change from an early period of parental retreat or negative interaction, was linked to favorable child development, including persistence in problem solving, high self-esteem, socially skilled behavior, closer friendships, and better peer relationships.9 In sum, high-quality involvement with children requires a certain quantity of time—actually, a great deal, as I’ll argue in this book.<n>In Angela and Tom’s case, sandwiching concentrated time with Victor and Jeannine between work and other obligations, which often took precedence over family rituals, meant that routines that signal parental caring and that are major sources of development went by the wayside. For example, family dinnertimes and storybook reading at bedtime became rare events. So did the sheer enjoyment that comes from relaxed parent–child play; a joint cooking, art, or construction project; and a conversation based on real listening and exchange of ideas. Because these experiences were so few and short-lived, Angela and Tom were deprived of valuable opportunities to observe their children closely and to become intimately familiar with their talents, shortcomings, preferences, styles of learning, and ways of coping with hardship—knowledge that is crucial for helping children develop into mature, competent individuals.<n>Furthermore, the “time bind” stiﬂes an essential child-rearing responsibility that I mentioned earlier and will return to again: monitoring children’s experiences while they are both within and beyond parents’ immediate reach. This includes frequently touching base with nonparental caregivers and teachers to ﬁnd out what’s happening at child care or in the classroom; looking in on sibling and peer interaction to make sure that it is positive and respectful; and controlling time spent watching TV and playing video games.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
Parents who throw up their hands in desperation and search through their own parents’ or grandparents’ shelves for a more “tried and true” vision will ﬁnd themselves mired in the same conundrum. They might, for example, run across Arnold Gesell’s books of the 1940s and 1950s—The Infant and Child in the Culture of Today, The First Five Years of Life, and The Child from Five to Ten38—still prominent in many bookstores. Oering a lock-step description of physical, intellectual, and emotional milestones at each age, Gesell aimed to reassure uneasy parents that children’s problematic behaviors were merely a phase—part of a biologically based sequence requiring understanding, not correction. A search of the previous generation’s parenting handbooks might uncover other volumes of this child-centered wave, including In Defense of Children, Children Have Their Reasons, and even Stop Annoying Your Children and Parents, Behave!<n>Experts of Gesell’s time complained that he went too far in downplaying the role of parents. His advice was soon overshadowed by Benjamin Spock’s standby, Baby and Child Care, published in 1946 and selling millions of copies over seven editions, the most recent appearing in 1998.39 Providing answers to virtually any question about child rearing that might occur to a parent, from physical care to emotional, disciplinary, and educational issues, Spock seemed, on many fronts, to lean toward parental ﬁrmness and away from children’s rule-of-the-roost. A closer look, however, indicates that even Spock felt torn between the embattled forces of adult and child control. He tried to grant legitimacy to both poles, commenting that perhaps it’s not what you do but how you do it:<n>A strictness that comes from harsh feelings or a permissiveness that is timid or vacillating can each lead to poor results. The real issue is what spirit the parent puts into managing the child and what attitude is engendered in the child as a result.40<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt

everyday routines and duties.  By participating in everyday routines and duties at home and in preschool, children develop a sense of responsible participation in family and community life. At the same time, they acquire practical skills and a wealth of knowledge about their physical and social surroundings. The parent always in a hurry—who says, when the child desires involvement, “There isn’t time,” or who fails to insist that the child join in household tasks in keeping with his or her capacity—severely limits the child’s learning.<n>In preindustrial times, children spent most of their day alongside parents as they went about housekeeping and earning a livelihood. As a result, children became deeply familiar with adults’ daily activities, picking up many skills through observation and direct participation. (Recall John Ise’s account of family life on a rural Kansas homestead, described in Chapter 1.) Greater parent–child togetherness throughout the day is also common in tribal and village societies, where adults spend less time supporting children’s learning through verbal scaolding because children have so many opportunities to observe and participate directly in the work of adults.98<n>Because ﬁne-tuned scaolding is seldom required, adult–child participation in everyday routines and duties—preparing a meal, washing dishes, raking and bagging leaves in the garden, buying groceries—oers extra time for conversation, with all its attendant beneﬁts. In addition, many informal learning opportunities arise that will serve children well when they get to school. An astute mother I observed in the grocery store had her 3-year-old son, Ricky, reach for items on the shelf and put them in the cart. When at the checkout counter Ricky became restless and whiny, his mother handed him her credit card and directed him to watch closely for the moment the clerk would need it. As the boy turned toward the register, the mother pointed out how the price of each item appeared on a screen. Ricky alternately named the numbers he recognized and counted items as they passed through the checkout. Awed by the responsibility of handing over the credit card, a task he had seen performed only by adults, Ricky complied eagerly—and also saw numerical concepts in action! Although grocery shopping with Ricky might take 10 or 15 minutes longer than otherwise, it has wide-ranging beneﬁts for his development.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
Yet a certain number of children and adolescents, despite exposure to severe family adversity, escape these diculties and adjust well. A common element in the lives of such resilient youngsters, as I noted in Chapter 1, is an unusually warm, positive relationship with at least one parent or a close tie with an adult outside the immediate family.125 What happens within these alternative relationships that shields the young person from problems or restores eective functioning? Although little systematic evidence exists on the precise ingredients of such ties, I recently became familiar with the bond forged between Hannah, a 21-year-old college student, and her Aunt Eva and Uncle Charlie, two of my university colleagues. Hannah’s parents divorced when she was 9 and her older sister Sarah was 15. Hannah related the story of her childhood and the genesis of her relationship with Eva and Charlie, who oered insights as well. What they had to say is enlightening.<n>“I can’t remember much family togetherness when I was a kid,” Hannah remarked. “Our parents couldn’t talk things out with each other, and they rarely talked things out with us. Mom took Sarah and me to Girl Scouts, swimming, piano, and other lessons. We enjoyed the activities and the friends we made, but they couldn’t compensate for what was missing: warm, family time. We almost never sat down to a meal together or went places together; we each went our own way. Our dad started going o on vacations by himself when holidays rolled around, so family get-togethers were rare.<n>“When our parents split up, we moved with our mom from Arkansas to Seattle. Mom worked all week, weekends, and most evenings. She had to get a career going so there’d be money to live on and to send us to college. Sarah hung out with another family in the neighborhood. A couple of times a week, she had dinner and went to church with them. Looking back, I’d say they were her substitute family; she ‘adopted’ them, and they ‘adopted’ her. I was too young to go o on my own that way. When I didn’t have after-school activities, Mom insisted that I come home and do chores and homework. Sometimes I got to go to a friend’s house to play, but many nights I’d open a can of spaghetti and have dinner by myself. I spent hours daydreaming and looking at old pictures of Mom, Dad, Sarah, and me.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt

The year after her college graduation, Sarah married a devout classmate, entering into a culture in which family life was pivotal. Six years later, Hannah started college, but for her the road to maturity was rough. She had diculty concentrating, earned uneven grades, and accumulated so many incompletes in courses that the university prohibited her from reenrolling until she wrapped up her “unﬁnished business.” Frustrated with Hannah’s undirectedness, her mother withdrew ﬁnancial support and insisted that she get a job. Hannah’s full-time waitressing soon became both an obstacle and an excuse for lack of progress in her studies. “I was at sea,” Hannah recalled. “I didn’t have any conﬁdence in myself, and I didn’t think I could do anything. So I started visiting Aunt Eva and Uncle Charlie, who lived three hours away.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
In poet Sylvia Plath’s childhood, stories and storytelling were pervasive. As a 2 1/2-year-old, Sylvia was intensely jealous of her sickly younger brother for consuming so much of her mother’s attention. While the baby nursed, Sylvia sat nearby on the ﬂoor, impatient and unhappy. Her mother discovered that she could defuse Sylvia’s envy with a game in which Sylvia spread out the newspaper before her, picked out all the capital letters on the page, and pretended, in a very grown-up way, to read—an achievement that attracted much parental admiration. Sylvia’s mother often made up bedtime tales, serialized from one evening to the next. Almost as soon as they could talk, Sylvia and her brother responded in kind with limericks, poems, and fantastic stories of their own. On walks to their grandparents’ house and on long car trips, favorite books invariably came along, offering ready inspiration for the children’s imaginative creations.54<n>Filmstar Charlie Chaplin’s mother was herself a talented comedy actress and singer. As a young child, Charlie often accompanied her when she went to work at the theater. As a result, playacting and impersonating became an early focus of Charlie’s pretending. One evening during a performance, his mother’s voice failed. In a pinch, the stage manager, who had seen Charlie at play, led the little boy onstage in her place. Charlie continued his playacting unabated, which included songs, dances, and impersonations from his mother’s repertoire. He was demonstrating the wares of his ﬁrst and best teacher in the art of make-believe, and the performance evoked a roar of appreciation and a shower of coins from the crowd.55<n>In these and many other similar biographical anecdotes, childhood make-believe engendered imaginativeness that was clearly related to outstanding accomplishment in adulthood. Of course, the scientiﬁc and artistic talents of individuals like Curie, Plath, and Chaplin are rare among us. Nevertheless, as play theorists Dorothy and Jerome Singer point out, all children have “that same potential for playfulness, for trying out possible lives, that is the foundation for a humbler but personally meaningful creativity.”56<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Although many teachers believe that a 5-year-old who’s on the young side can beneﬁt from waiting another year before enrolling in kindergarten and advise parents to hold the child out, research has not revealed any advantages for delayed entry. A host of studies indicate that younger children make just as much progress, academically and socially, as do older children enrolled in the same grade. No difference exists between younger and older classmates in achievement test scores.45<n>A related dilemma involves whether to retain a kindergartner for a second kindergarten year if he or she is not progressing well. More than a half-century of research has failed to show any learning beneﬁts for children retained in grade, and mounting evidence indicates that retention can be harmful, prompting negative attitudes toward school and a drop in self-esteem and in academic motivation, even as early as kindergarten.46 In one study, retained kindergarten children, despite the extra year of school, scored lower than their classmates in academic achievement after entering the primary grades. In contrast, children recommended for retention but who nevertheless went on to ﬁrst grade were doing just as well as classmates who had been promoted in the standard fashion.47<n>Yet another alternative is to place a poorly performing kindergarten child in a “transition” class—a waystation between kindergarten and ﬁrst grade. Transition classes, however, are a form of homogeneous grouping that gathers children judged by the school system as less likely to succeed. As with other “low-ability” groups, teachers often have lower expectations for transition-class students and teach them in a less stimulating fashion than they do other children.48<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
La Adelita is more than a romantic image to modern-day Chicanas. She continues to symbolize feminine independence, integrity, the fight for justice, and a proud heritage. Because the major influx of Mexican immigration into the United States was during the Mexican Revolution, many Chicanos and Chicanas grew up hearing stories about soldaderas and La Adelita from relatives, parents, and grandparents. In the late 1960s Chicanas who joined the Brown Berets de Aztlán, a political pseudomilitary youth group, often dressed as Adelitas, wearing rebozos (shawls) and bandoliers crisscrossed over their chests.<n>One play about La Adelita, titled Soldadera, written by Josephine Niggli, was produced and performed in the United States in 1936, and is still performed today. Niggli was 25 years old when the play was written. She went on to write Mexican Village, a novel that incorporated many of the Mexican people’s folk customs and traditions. Born in Monterrey, Mexico, she lived in Mexico City and was taught at home by her mother. Later she moved to San Antonio, Texas, where she attended high school. She went to the University of North Carolina for playwriting, sometimes acting in her own plays. Soldadera is a play about the women in the Revolution, “women who left homes to follow their men, cooking for them, tending their wounds, guarding their ammunition, fighting when necessary,” as Niggli put it. The Adelita character dies in the play, and Niggli idealizes her bravery.<n>One variant of the corrido “La Adelita” follows:<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt
Aguinaldos (Christmas Gifts)<n>The translation of this word found in Spanish dictionaries is a “gift given at Christmas.” In the folk tradition, it is a small gift given at a Christmas party or celebration, usually in the form of food or candy. During Las Posadas, the reenactment of the pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph’s search for an inn, when celebrations are held in private homes, the hostess will pass out aguinaldos to the children. These can be small bags or baskets filled with candy, nuts, fruits, or toys. It is a gift given as a sharing, a memento, a remembrance, rather than as a Christmas present. Mention of the custom of aguinaldos is found in Cabeza de Baca’s book, The Good Life. Américo Paredes describes a slightly different tradition of aguinaldos that he learned in song form from his mother in South Texas. During the days between Christmas and Día de los Reyes (the Day of the Kings, or Epiphany), January 6, young boys went from house to house singing carols called aguinaldos, and asking for food and gifts. Homes were opened to them and they were offered good things to eat and drink. In this context aguinaldos are Christmas songs.<n>This expression has also been used when describing a children’s custom in the Southwest. On Christmas Day children went knocking on doors and visiting homes, asking for and receiving candy or small toys. Sometimes they would sing a song that sounded more like a prayer or a chant, called Oremos. Lottie Devine describes a custom in Arizona where the local Indians visited homes on Christmas Day, receiving food and drinks. This was referred to as “calling Christmas.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt

The title of a song, as well as the title of a movie directed by Luis Valdez in 1987. The film is about the life of the Chicano singer Ritchie Valens, who recorded the song and made it very popular in 1958. The song actually goes back to early Mexican colonial history; it has been traced to 1790 when it was performed at the Coliseo Theatre in Mexico City. There are printed sources that cite the song being sung and danced in Veracruz during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By the 1830s it was also a popular dance in Mexican California.<n>“La Bamba” is considered to be a son jarocho (country folks’ dancing music), an example of the mestizo (mixed-race) musical tradition, with strong African influences, from the state of Veracruz. The instrumentation of the traditional son jarocho included a small harp, a small eight-string guitar (jarana), and a small four-string guitar (requinto). The dance that went with son jarocho was a zapateado, a foot-stomping dance. There are two different accounts about how Ritchie Valens learned the song, since he supposedly never learned Spanish. One source states that he heard the song on a short trip across the border into Mexico, and another states he learned the song from his uncle when he was five years old. His innovative style mixed jarocho music with a rock ‘n roll beat. His recorded version of “La Bamba” in 1958 is the first known U.S. recording. “La Bamba” has now been recorded more than 150 different times in the United States; for example, in 1966 by Trini Lopez, in 1979 by the Plugz, and in 1980 by Los Lobos. The Rice University Marching Band and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir have also recorded it. The movie, with the soundtrack recorded by Los Lobos, was very successful with mainstream audiences and launched the acting careers of several Latino actors.<n>References La Bamba 1987; Guevara 1985; Holscher, Fernandez, and Cummings 1991; -Lipsitz 1990; Loza 1982; Sheehy 1979<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
According to the tragic legend, there once was a woman who was abandoned by her husband, or lover, and left with two or three children. Angry and seeking revenge, she kills her children by throwing them into a river, or sometimes by other means. When she realizes what she’s done, she goes insane. She is condemned to spend eternity searching for her lost and dead children. Consequently she is often heard in the night calling her children. She frequents rivers and other bodies of water, and is sometimes seen floating above the water looking, searching for her children. Her legend has been recited for over 300 years, and in contemporary times she is still believed to be wandering the streets in large cities, as well as in the small towns of the Southwest where numerous people report encounters with her. At times she is seen as a beautiful woman, wearing a white dress, roaming back streets and country roads, crying and weeping. Sometimes she becomes visible to the wayward husband who is out late, drinking, and when he approaches her, she turns into an ugly horse-faced hag, scaring him into swearing abstinence forever. Parents use her name to scare little children into obedience: “Hay viene La Llorona . . . portaté bien” (The Llorona is coming, behave yourself). Even adults who’ve heard the story many times and do not want to admit belief still fear a late-night encounter with La Llorona.<n>There are ancient texts of indigenous mythology narrated by the Aztecs and recorded by the Spaniards that very closely resemble the La Llorona legend. In some tales she is believed to be Cihuacoatl, the patron goddess of women who die in childbirth. It is said that Cihuacoatl carried a little baby cradle on her back, or a dead baby in her arms, as she roamed the country crying through the nights. Those who saw her considered it an ill omen. Sahagún mentions in The Conquest of Mexico that “a woman was often heard [as] she went weeping and crying out. Loudly did she call out at night. She walked about saying: ‘O my beloved sons, now we are about to go!’” (Horcasitas and Butterworth, 208). Horcasitas and Butterworth reprint several texts of these early chronicles. Diego Muñoz Camargo (ca. 1529–1599) also reported that before the Spaniards arrived, “many times and many nights was heard the voice of a woman who cried out in a loud voice, drowning herself with her tears, and with great sobs and sighs, wailing” (Horcasitas and Butterworth, 209).<n>Contemporary texts of La Llorona collected in Mexico assert that the original Llorona was La Malinche, the mistress of Cortés. Cortés abandoned her to return to Spain, and according to the legend Malinche killed their son with a knife. This could be the source of another characteristic of the La Llorona legend. In many variants the reason for her abandonment by her lover is their class differences. He leaves her for someone of his own class, or she is an Indian woman or a mestiza (mixed-race woman) and he is of pure blood. In other variants, she is a woman of the streets, who doesn’t want her illegitimate children, so she throws them into the river. She is always described as having long hair, down below her waist, and is seen wearing a white gown. Sometimes men see her as a temptress and a siren; she entices them to follow her, and then she frightens them with her horrible looks. They are usually found dead the next day. What appears to be an unjust punishment is that La Llorona is condemned to wander for eternity, crying and repenting, searching for her lost children. All mothers who have lost children identify with her, and feel her pain.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
In Chicano culture a person who turns his back on his people is call a malinchero or, if it’s a woman who has betrayed her community, a malinche. Contemporary Chicanas have taken La Malinche as a positive role model to illustrate and explain the survivalist psyche of the Chicana in modern society. Her influence in the conquest of Mexico may be debatable, but there is no doubt that she is considered a heroine, almost on the same plane as La Virgen de Guadalupe. Octavio Paz writes of La Malinche as the “violated woman,” La Chingada, and his writings have influenced several generations of Mexicanos and Chicanos in seeing the Mexican people as “hijos de la chingada,” that is, “sons of a conquest by rape.”<n>Cortés married Doña Marina off to one of his lieutenants, Juan Jaramillo, and they had one daughter. She went with them to Central America and there died of an illness when she was approximately twenty-three years of age. Some scholars regard La Malinche as the archetype of La Llorona and others think of her as the original Llorona (weeping woman), while some consider her to be the source of La Llorona legend.<n>To many Chicanas Malinche has become a symbol for the socioeconomic and educational limitations of contemporary life. They feel the defamation of her character is equal to the denigration of Chicanas. The victimization and criminalization of Malinche, a double oppression, is parallel to the experiences of young Chicanas and Mexicanas. Malinche and La Virgen de Guadalupe are two archetypes of womanhood in Mexico and in the Southwest, the whore and the virgin, who symbolize the precarious dilemma of being female. Malinche has played an enormous role in the literary production of Chicana writing, in essays and short stories, but especially in poetry.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
Doors and windows we will break.)<n>The chant states that they’re angels from heaven and are asking for gifts, although if they receive none, they may break doors and windows. The origin of this custom is not known, but some believe it is to remind society that the stranger at the door should not be forgotten.

These seven propositions summarize the enduring content of the Reconstruction Amendments.13 The key provisions of these amendments define political membership, articulate basic rights, and provide an ambit of legislative competence. So reformed, the American system of government would be able to protect individual rights as well as promote the equality of all persons who survived the war. Of course, we must assume a set of institutions—a Congress, an Executive, and a Judiciary—that will continue to function according to the terms of their initial creation.<n>Still, there is something missing in this filtering off of the three Reconstruction Amendments and calling them a separate constitution. The missing factor is the consciousness of setting forth a new framework of government, a structure based on values fundamentally different from those that went before. To find that consciousness, we need to turn, I wish to argue, to the critical message of the Civil War, the address that would generate a new normative world in which to make sense of the epic war that consumed America from the firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox. The new Nomos, the new framework of values that necessitated a new constitution, comes forth in one of the great prayers of the American civil religion, the Gettysburg Address. It is worth recalling some of the enduring phrases of this civil prayer, the incantations that reverberated in American consciousness:<n>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation. . . .<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt
The historical retreat to the Declaration of Independence left Lincoln with a major paradox. He claims to be speaking as president, and his office owed its existence to Article II of the Constitution of 1787. Yet, he thought himself back prior to the Philadelphia convention and the creation of the presidency. He pulled the rug of legitimacy out from under his own office. To be able to advocate the principle that all men are created equal, that a nation was born committed to this principle, he had to speak from a time prior to the creation of the government for which the Union troops died.<n>The precursor to this unusual mode of dating comes in an unexpected place—in the final paragraph of the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863:<n>Done at the City of Washington, this first day of<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt

Many of us have now explored the application of Bak’s ideas in models of coevolution that I will discuss shortly. With caveats that other explanations may account for the data, the general result is that something may occur that is like a theory of coevolutionary assembly that yields a self-organized critical biosphere with a power law distribution of small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events. As we shall see, the best data now suggest that precisely such a power law distribution of extinction and speciation events has occurred over the past 650 million years of the Phanerozoic. In addition, the same body of theory predicts that most species go extinct soon after their formation, while some live a long time. The predicted species lifetime distribution is a power law. So too are the data.<n>Similar phenomena may occur in an econosphere. Small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events occur in our technologies. A colleague, Brian Arthur, is fond of pointing out that when the car came in, the horse, buggy, buggy whip, saddlery, smithy, and Pony Express went out of business. The car paved the way for an oil and gas industry, paved roads, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote about this kind of turbulence in capitalist economies. These Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction appear to occur in small and large avalanches. Perhaps the avalanches arise in power laws. And, like species, most firms die young; some make it to old age = Storre, in Sweden, is over nine hundred years old. The distribution of firm lifetimes is again a power law.<n>Here are hints = common law, ecosystems, economic systems = that general principles govern the coevolutionary coconstruction of lives and livings, organisms and natural games, firms and economic opportunities. Perhaps such a law governs any biosphere anywhere in the cosmos.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
The problem, briefly, is that there appears to be no finitely prestatable set of conditions about sense data statements whose truth is logically equivalent to any statement about a real physical chair in a living room.<n>Wittgenstein invented the concept of a “language game,” a codefined cluster of concepts that carve up the world in some new way. Consider, he said, legal language, and try translating it to ordinary statements about human agents without using legal concepts. So consider, “The jury found Henderson guilty of murder.” We understand this statement but do so in the context of law, evidence, legal responsibility, trials, guilt and innocence, jury systems, bribing jury members, appeal processes, and so forth. Now try to translate the statement into a set of statements about ordinary human actions, “A group of twelve people were seated behind a wooden enclosure for several days. People talked about someone having died of poison. One day, the twelve people left the room and went to another room and talked about what had happened. Then the twelve people came back and one man stood up and uttered the words, ‘We find Henderson guilty of murder.’”<n>There is no finitely prespecifiable list of statements about ordinary human actions whose truth would be necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement that the jury found Henderson guilty of murder.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Something has obviously happened in the past . billion years. The biosphere has expanded, indeed, more or less persistently exploded, into the ever-expanding adjacent possible. The secular diversity of organic molecular species has increased, on average, over the past . billion years.<n>It is more than slightly interesting that this fact is clearly true, that it is rarely remarked upon, and that we have no particular theory for this expansion. Indeed, I note for future reference that the standing diversity of species in the biosphere has, on average, with noticeable crashes in large extinction events, increased over the past . billion years. And among us mere humans, the diversity of ways of making a living has increased dramatically over the past million years, the past hundred thousand years, and even over the past thousand years. If you wanted a rabbit for dinner thirty thousand years ago, you bloody well went out and caught a rabbit. Now most of us can go buy a rabbit dinner. Something again has happened. At the level of species and ways of making a living in the “econosphere,” the actual has expanded into a persistent adjacent possible.<n>We are all parts of the universe. So, in our little hunk of the universe, with the sun shining beatifically upon us, rather remarkable goings on have occurred. Indeed, the biosphere may be one of the most complex things in the universe.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
Now, the idea that Bruce and Tim had was that building a community with random critters having random food and niche requirements is like the Ksat problem. They consider S species. Each species’ niche includes some of the S species that it eats and some that eat or kill it. Thus, species S must eat S or S or S to survive, but can survive on its own only in the absence of S, which poisons the chloroplasts that allow S to be an autotroph. In disjunctive form, the requirements for species S to survive are (S v S v S) and (not S).<n>Bruce and Tim did numerical experiments for dierent values of S and K and C where again K is the number of alternative species any given species could eat. (S v S v S) corresponds to K = .They found the same phase transition. As more and more species are added, there are more potential interactions among the species since the pairwise possibilities increase as the square of the total species diversity. As this occurs, each species appears in an increasing number of clauses, so as C/V increases, at some point the satisfiability of the Ksat system went from easy to hard. It became hard, then impossible, to add new species. The community filled up because the Ksat problem went from easy to impossible.<n>I find this line of thinking rather interesting. Given rather general assumptions on the probability per pair of species of who eats or kills what, assigned more or less randomly, then as the number of species, hence pairs of species increase, such communities can fill up in the presence of persistent attempts at invasion. Bruce and Tim may have found the underlying reason for Stuart and Mack’s earlier results. Moreover, Bruce and Tim have found reasonable numerical evidence for small and large avalanches of local extinction events upon entry of new species while the community was filling up.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
But recall that a mixed microbial community should be able to be driven to the subcritical-supracritical boundary by increasing the diversity of microbial species present and/or hitting the community with a sucient diversity of novel small molecule species. My argument follows that if the community is supracritical, the novel cascading molecular species will kill o some of the microbial species, thereby lowering the community toward the subcritical regime. On the other hand, mutation and immigration should drive the community toward the supracritical regime. Do mixed microbial communities hover on the subcritical-supracritical boundary? We have seen other reasons that bound a community’s complexity, including Ksat problems noted in this chapter. So a better question is: Can microbial communities be driven supracritical? And if so, are they often near that boundary?<n>Of course, I do not know, but the hypothesis is testable. Increase the diversity of species and test for the diversity of synthesized small molecules, say, by gas chromatography. A colleague and I once devised such an experiment with mixtures of increasingly diverse moss species, planning to measure the molecular diversity of gas species evolved as a function of community diversity and the diversity in gas species introduced to the community. We went skiing instead. I still like the lines of the experiment. It could be carried out directly with mixed microbial communities as well.<n>As noted in the previous chapter, there must be some interplay in the entry into the adjacent possible that gates the exploration by the capacity of natural selection to trim away the losers. I described the Manfred Eigen–Peter Schuster error catastrophe. If the mutation rate in a population of viruses is low, by successive rare successful mutations the population climbs steadily uphill, then becomes trapped on or in the near vicinity of a local peak.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
We need a theory of the persistent coming into existence of new goods and services and extinction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera.<n>But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. With the horse went the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. With the car came paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. Most firms die young, some last a long time. We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions.<n>The parallels are at least tantalizing, and probably more than that. While the mechanisms of heritable variation dier and the selection criteria dier, organisms in the biosphere and firms and individuals in the econosphere are busy trying to make a living and explore new ways of making a living. In both cases, the puzzling conditions for the evolutionary cocreation and coassembly of increasing diversity are present. The biosphere and econosphere are persistently transforming, persistently inventing, persistently dying, persistently getting on with it, and, on average, persistently diversifying. And into a framework of such a diversifying set of goods and services we must graft the central insights of general competitive equilibrium as the approximate short-timescale mechanism that achieves a rough-and-ready approximate clearing of markets at each stage of the evolution of the economy.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
Technology Graphs and Economic Webs<n>Life takes its unexpected turns. I have been an academic scientist, a biologist, for thirty years at the University of Chicago, the National Institutes of Health, the University of Pennsylvania, then twelve stunningly exciting years at the Santa Fe Institute. After thirty years, I’ve written the canonical hundred or more scientific articles, was fortunate enough to receive a MacArthur Fellowship, during whose five years my IQ went up and then slumped back to normal as the funding ended, invented and patented this and that, and published two previous books of which I am proud, Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe, both by Oxford University Press.<n>I thought Origins and At Home were largely about the challenge of extending Darwinism to an account of evolution that embraced both self-organization and natural selection in some new, still poorly understood marriage. One hundred and forty years after Darwin, after all, we still have only inklings about the kinds of systems that are capable of adaptation. What principles, if any, govern the coevolutionary assembly of complex systems such as ecosystems or British common law, where a new finding by a judge alters precedent in ways that ricochet in small and large avalanches through the law? If new determinations by judges did not have any wider impact, the law could not evolve. If every new determination altered interpretation of precedents throughout the entire corpus of common law, the law also could not evolve.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
There are three distinct reasons for the intimate relationship between dress and décor. The first is technical. Décor, like dress, incorporates fabrics. Curtains, swags, and window-treatments are made of silk, damask, satin, brocade, wool, muslin, and velvet—so is clothing. Woven materials are used in tapestries, wall-hangings, carpets and upholstery as well as coats and skirts. Inevitably, the dressmaker’s techniques of embroidering, gathering, pleating, and trimming find their way into décor. This is why furniture skirts recall women’s skirts, and why the fringes, cords, and bobbins of nineteenth-century drapery recall ladies’ ballgowns. The delicate lace curtains and the billowing baldachin over a bed in a ladies’ boudoir matched the clothes in her dressing room.<n>The connection between décor and dress can be even more intimate, for architecture sometimes directly mimics dress. The garlands in eighteenth-century buildings are sculpted or painted versions of the sashes and flowered ornaments worn by men and women. The ancient Greeks incorporated elements of dress in temple architecture. This is most apparent in colonnades, which Vincent Scully has likened to hoplites massed in a phalanx.2 There is no doubt that Classical columns were given human attributes. Ancient authors likened the vertical flutes to the folds in a chiton, or tunic.3 Columns have capitals—that is, heads. The moldings of Doric capitals were sometimes painted to resemble headbands; Ionic and Corinthian capitals incorporated carved head garlands, and the curving tendrils of Corinthian capitals often look more like hair than foliage. Indeed, Vitruvius considered the Corinthian order “feminine,” as opposed to the sturdy masculine Doric. Sir Henry Wotton went so far as to call the Corinthian order “lascivious” and “decked like a wanton courtesan.”4<n>The second connection between dress and décor is social. In the 1890s, the famous English economist Alfred Marshall observed that as people earned more money, they wanted better food, better clothes and larger homes—both for social standing and comfort. Since homes and clothes are timeworn ways in which to convey status, there is a conformity in the types of materials and symbols used to convey social standing. If family coats of arms are displayed, they will be seen on wall medallions as well as on blazer buttons. If gold is treasured, the wealthy will wear gold braid and surround themselves with gilt moldings. If this is considered too flashy, other materials can convey status: stainless steel kitchen appliances and stainless steel watch bracelets. Diamonds may be forever, but fashions change. Today, leather is considered a luxury material, and is used both for expensive clothing and expensive sofas. A hundred years ago, leather was considered utilitarian; leather aprons and vests were worn only by workmen, and leather easy chairs were only found in smoking rooms and men’s clubs since leather was less flammable than fabric. But it was never used in salons or drawing rooms. When corduroy, originally used only in workingmen’s dress, became accepted by the middle class, it also showed up as upholstery. The current fashion for “natural” dress fabrics—cotton, wool, linen—has a counterpart in “natural” décor: exposed brick, oiled wood, polished concrete.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch1.txt

"WE HAVE SOME PLANES"<n>Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run.<n>For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
Command Center: Uh, who, it hit the ground. That's what they're speculating, that's speculation only.<n>The aircraft that spotted the "black smoke" was the same unarmed Air National Guard cargo plane that had seen American 77 crash into the Pentagon 27 minutes earlier. It had resumed its flight to Minnesota and saw the smoke from the crash of United 93, less than two minutes after the plane went down. At 10:17, the Command Center advised headquarters of its conclusion that United 93 had indeed crashed.<n>Despite the discussions about military assistance, no one from FAA headquarters requested military assistance regarding United 93. Nor did any manager at FAA headquarters pass any of the information it had about United 93 to the military.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering "how the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower.<n>Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.<n>The Agencies Confer<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
The Pentagon Teleconferences. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director for operations immediately thought the second strike was a terrorist attack. The job of the NMCC in such an emergency is to gather the relevant parties and establish the chain of command between the National Command Authority-the president and the secretary of defense- and those who need to carry out their orders.<n>On the morning of September 11, Secretary Rumsfeld was having breakfast at the Pentagon with a group of members of Congress. He then returned to his office for his daily intelligence briefing. The Secretary was informed of the second strike in New York during the briefing; he resumed the briefing while awaiting more information. After the Pentagon was struck, Secretary Rumsfeld went to the parking lot to assist with rescue efforts.<n>Inside the NMCC, the deputy director for operations called for an allpurpose "significant event" conference. It began at 9:29, with a brief recap: two aircraft had struck the World Trade Center, there was a confirmed hijacking of American 11, and Otis fighters had been scrambled. The FAA was asked to provide an update, but the line was silent because the FAA had not been added to the call. A minute later, the deputy director stated that it had just been confirmed that American 11 was still airborne and heading toward D.C. He directed the transition to an air threat conference call. NORAD confirmed that American 11 was airborne and heading toward Washington, relaying the erroneous FAA information already mentioned. The call then ended, at about 9:34.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary.<n>Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization.<n>At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to "engage or "take out" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: "I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out."<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
SecDef: We can't confirm that. We're told that one aircraft is down but we do not have a pilot report that did it.<n>As this exchange shows, Secretary Rumsfeld was not in the NMCC when the shootdown order was first conveyed. He went from the parking lot to his office (where he spoke to the President), then to the Executive Support Center, where he participated in the White House video teleconference. He moved to the NMCC shortly before 10:30, in order to join Vice Chairman Myers. Secretary Rumsfeld told us he was just gaining situational awareness when he spoke with the Vice President at 10:39. His primary concern was ensuring that the pilots had a clear understanding of their rules of engagement.<n>The Vice President was mistaken in his belief that shootdown authorization had been passed to the pilots flying at NORAD's direction. By 10:45 there was, however, another set of fighters circling Washington that had entirely different rules of engagement. These fighters, part of the 113th Wing of the District of Columbia Air National Guard, launched out of Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland in response to information passed to them by the Secret Service. The first of the Andrews fighters was airborne at 10:38.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there.<n>The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready allies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation.<n>In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-History.txt
Yet if the façades of the buildings hark back to the past, the interiors do not. Internet banking, interactive information points, and resource recycling advice centers — the concepts of today are alive and thriving all around the city. This is no historic ghost town, the city brims with people. Its houses are still lived in (although most are now apartments rather than single-family homes), and its streets filled with bakeries, delicatessens, and wine merchants where people drop in to buy dinner on the way home in the evenings. It’s all part of the fascinating dichotomy you find at every turn here. The city strides into the future while still holding hands with the past.<n>The historic heart of Amsterdam has remained unchanged mainly because of people power. As in most cities in the world, during the second part of the 20th century property developers eyed the old canal houses with relish. The price of land was soaring, and developers could make a tidy profit by demolishing them and replacing them with something modern. Unfashionable buildings, such as the warehouses of the old docks, were simply left to the elements, deemed to be worthless. Amsterdammers, though, had other ideas. They went out onto the streets to fight for their city, barricading historic houses and occupying empty buildings in the warehouse district.<n>This was typical of the populace, and it wasn’t the first time; in fact Amsterdammers have been standing up for what they believe in for centuries. When Protestants were persecuted in the 16th century, they flocked here from all around Europe to take refuge. During WWII, the dock workers of Amsterdam went on strike as an act of protest against the treatment of the Jews in the city. Although in the end the protest was futile, it shows the strength of feeling and social awareness that pervades every part of society here. As the 21st century begins, Amsterdam has over 100 different nationalities living within the city boundaries, a situation which could be fraught with difficulty and strain. Yet here it only adds to the cultural richness built up over centuries of exploration and trade.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-Intro.txt

Yet here it only adds to the cultural richness built up over centuries of exploration and trade.<n>Amsterdammers seem to have the ability to find creative solutions to the problems of their world. When there wasn’t enough housing on the land, they looked at the empty canals and decided that houseboats would help. There are now over 2,500 on the waterways of the city. When cars became a problem in the old town they gave the bicycle priority, and now there are over 1,000,000 on the streets — and an estimated 30,000 at the bottom of the canal system at any one time! You’ll quickly learn to listen for the warning bells and stand clear as their riders pedal by.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-Intro.txt
Running parallel to Jodenbreestraat on the left-hand side is Waterlooplein, named after the famous battle and home to the famous flea market of the same name. Every day you’ll find an eclectic mix of second-hand crockery, clothes, and electrical equipment on sale, along with cotton clothes from India or Indonesia. The eastern end of the market square is dominated by the twin spires of Mozes en Aäronkerk (Moses and Aaron Church), a Catholic Church built in 1840 on the site of a secret chapel. The Old Testament figures of Moses and Aaron were found depicted on gable stones in the original building and were set into the wall of the new edifice. The fine towers are actually wood rather than stone. They were painted to match the sandstone walls in a 1990 restoration.<n>Waterlooplein — and its market — used to be much larger, but a massive building project begun in the early 1980s cut its size considerably. Protesters deplored the loss of several old canal houses fringing the square which constituted much of what was left of the old Jewish Quarter. Nevertheless, the construction went ahead, and the result of this labor is the Muziek Theater and Stadhuis, the front façade and entrance of which sits majestically on the Amstel River.<n>The attractive glass-fronted building was opened in 1986. It is home to the Netherlands Opera and the National Ballet and also hosts a range of traveling companies in what is the largest auditorium in the Netherlands. Amsterdammers have christened this combination of town hall and theater the “stopera” (staduis+opera).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Byzantine and Ottoman Obscurity<n>When Roman Emperor Constantine gave Christianity official sanction in 326, he looked for a “New Rome” in the eastern Mediterranean. Athens hoped to be chosen but the title of new capital went to the former Greek colonial town of Byzantium (Constantinople), now Istanbul. Under Byzantine rule the city of Pericles sank into deep provincial obscurity. It merited only a few brief mentions in the history of the following centuries.<n>Christianity had taken early root in Greece, as a result of St. Paul’s visit to Athens somewhere around 50 a.d. Polytheism, however, persisted until 529, when an edict by Emperor Justinian outlawed the last “pagan” temples and closed the famous Athenian schools of philosophy.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-History.txt
Civil War Blockade Running<n>Over the centuries, trouble on the nearby American continent has often meant good news for the Bahamas. When Lincoln ordered a blockade of the southern states in 1861 after the outbreak of the Civil War, the Bahamas quickly boomed. Nassau harbor was busy with ships unloading Confederate cotton and tobacco and taking aboard arms, medicine, and manufactured goods, mainly from Europe, to be run back through the northern blockade. As the war went on, speedy and camouflaged contraband vessels were built to slip past the ever-increasing Federal patrols. Profits from blockade running were incredible, and Nassau went wild. But the extravagant parties and carefree spending stopped abruptly with the North’s victory in 1865. Late the following year an immense hurricane sent a tidal wave over Hog Island (today Paradise Island), smashing Nassau’s flimsy buildings and ruining crops. Other islands were also devastated. As the Bahamas sank back into economic doldrums, citizens turned to agriculture, fishing, or salt raking. The spread of lighthouses and decent navigational charts had crippled the old standby, the wrecking trade.<n>For a time a new fiber called sisal seemed promising. But Bahamian soil was too poor and Mexico grew a better plant. Neville Chamberlain, future British Prime Minister, took over his family’s sisal operation on Andros in the 1890s. It failed, the natives said, because of that island’s evil elves called chickcharnies, who cast a spell on the family for disturbing the land. Hopes were raised, and also fizzled, over Bahamian citrus and pineapple. Sponging, another vitally important industry at the end of the 19th century, also had setbacks. A hurricane in 1839 drowned some 300 sponge fishermen in the ‘mud’ off Andros, and a devastating fungus some 40 years later killed almost all the sponges.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-History.txt
Paradise Island<n>Across Nassau Harbour north of the town is Paradise Island, known until the 1940s as Hog Island. For many centuries the island simply acted as a protective barrier against bad weather and attack from invaders. Its recent history is fascinating: In the 1930s it was owned by Swedish millionaire Axel Wenner-Gren, an arms manufacturer who was found to be a Nazi sympathizer. He sold the island to Huntingdon Hartford, who changed the name from Hog to Paradise and created a beautiful private retreat, now the Ocean Club Hotel. Later gangster Per Lansky began the process that transformed the island from a private sanctuary with magnificent homes into a playground for tourists. The wonderful beaches, such as Cabbage Beach on the northern coast, were the focus of the development. The first hotels began to appear in the 1960s when gambling was a lure to the rich and famous. As Paradise Island saw owners Donald Trump and Merv Griffin come and go, it went through a continuing series of developments and re-developments.<n>Today Paradise Island may be close to fulfilling the dream of the perfect vacation playground. It has many of the essential ingredients needed: fine white-sand beaches, a protected marina, a golf course, a group of fine hotels, and perhaps the biggest adult playground this side of Las Vegas. The brainchild of the Sol Group, Atlantis Paradise Island is a new concept in resorts — it’s a huge hotel with an amazing theme park and entertainment village all on one site. The resort takes its name, and inspiration, from the lost city of Atlantis, said by some to lie off the coast of Bimini. This theme runs throughout the whole resort. The vast open foyers and public areas of the hotel have high columns of cathedral-like dimensions; the walkways and outside terraces recall Mayan temples, with large stones covering the façade. Waterfalls literally or figuratively cascade to give a feeling of a city just having risen from the ocean. Man-made sheltered lagoons provide for safe swimming, snorkeling, and sunbathing.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
This tiny patch of land, 63 sq miles in area, is at the center of a momentous turning point in history, for it was here that Christopher Columbus first made landfall in the New World, on 12 October 1492. One can only imagine the relief of his crew, and perhaps Columbus’s own sense of satisfaction that his theories had proved to be correct (though not entirely, since he assumed he had found the Indian subcontinent).<n>Around the shoreline of San Salvador are four separate places that are purported to be the site of Columbus’s landing. No one will ever know for sure, of course, but the competition continues. After the Spaniards went on to other islands in the Caribbean, the island became a base for English pirate John Watling; indeed until 1926 it was known as Watling’s Island.<n>The interior of San Salvador is dotted with lakes; there is a great deal of marshy land and only one major road. Cockburn Town (pronounced “KOE-burn”) is the capital. Pride of place in the town goes to the small jail found by the main coast road. It’s now a museum because, as one resident said, “we don’t have no need for no jail.” (The opening hours are irregular.)<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
In 1550 Bali was united under Batu Renggong, the formidable ruler known as Dewa Agung (god-king) of Gelgel, near Klungkung. His men even succeeded in turning back the tide of Islam for a short while, adding eastern Java and Lombok to his domains. During his rule, Balinese power, culture, and influence reached a peak, with a boom in temple building and the associated crafts of sculpture and woodcarving.<n>During the next 250 years, Bali’s rulers fell to squabbling among themselves and the island split into ten or more rajadoms. Bali’s contact with the Dutch was restricted to providing slaves — mainly Balinese who had broken the rajas’ laws or priests’ taboos — and soldiers for the army of the United Dutch East Indies Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC). The company was the instrument of influence of the Netherlands until it went bankrupt in 1799 and was superseded by the government. Throughout the 18th century, Dutch influence and authority slowly spread across the Indonesian archipelago, but bypassed the relatively poor, unimportant island of Bali.<n>Between 1811 and 1817, during the Napoleonic Wars, Britain took control of Indonesia and seriously thought of staying once the wars were over. Britain’s administrator, Stamford Raffles, who was named Lieutenant Governor, even visited Bali, and may have had it in mind to build a trading station here. After the war, however, the British government decided to restore Dutch territory and interests — and Raffles found another site, the island and future port of Singapore.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-History.txt
The period between 1959 and 1965 was a surreal time of government by means of slogans and Orwellian acronyms. Sukarno attempted to control the competing nationalist, religious, and communist groups; NASAKOM was the word he used to represent their supposed common interests. As if that wasn’t enough, processions paraded with placards emblazoned with MANIPOL (Sukarno’s political manifesto) and DEKON (his economic declaration) written on them, and there were others which condemned NEKOLIM (neo-colonialism and imperialism). In the meantime, the Indonesian economy collapsed and hyper-inflation destroyed the currency.<n>The country’s limited foreign-exchange reserves were squandered on window-dressing projects, grand monuments, and stadiums to host the Asian Games of 1962, seen as part of a plan to bring Indonesia into the world spotlight. International travel agents were given a tour of the country, including a visit to Bali that coincided with an important Balinese ceremony in March 1963 at the so-called “mother temple” Besakih, on the slopes of the island’s highest mountain, Gunung Agung. Portentously, Gunung Agung, though long dormant, chose this particular moment to begin emitting smoke and firing rocks into the air, but the ceremony went ahead anyway, literally under a cloud. The official guests had scarcely left Bali when Gunung Agung exploded in what was the most violent eruption the island had seen in centuries. Lava flowed down its slopes, but despite the impressions conveyed by reporters (and by photographs seen in many books), it covered only a limited area. The chief instrument of destruction was the volcanic ash that showered down on the northern half of Bali, covering it with a layer 40 cm (15 inches) thick. Crops were wiped out; the rice terraces were devastated, and starvation threatened.<n>The ash fall also blocked rivers, but the dams it formed could not retain the waters for long. When they broke, torrents of mud and rock tore down the valleys and through the villages and towns along the river banks. The official death toll of 1,600 was a wild underestimate. The sky went black even over southern Bali, although Denpasar received only a sprinkling of ash.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-History.txt

There’s an even better view into the caldera, and no fuss, from the road a short way east from Penelokan (heading towards Suter and Rendang, the turnoff for Besakih).<n>Mount Batur went into an active phase in August 1994, blowing huge puffs of smoke and rocky debris from a new vent on its northwest face. As a result, some of the tracks there were cut. In addition, unsavory locals harass climbers. Only hikes accompanied by guides from the local guiding cooperative are advised. Travel agencies elsewhere on Bali that specialize in nature/active tours can make arrangements for hikers. A steep zig-zag road winds down to the lake: Bemos and motorcycle jockeys are ready to take anyone without transport to Kedisan, a lakeside village where you will find a few modest homestays.<n>On the lake’s western shore, reached by a road winding through lava fields, lies Tirta, or Toyabungkah, known for its hot springs. They are believed to be both holy and highly therapeutic, and are channeled into a public pool — as hot as a steaming bath. You can also enjoy the thermal waters at a new spa complex in the center of town. A scattering of homestays and rudimentary eating places has now been dwarfed by a big hotel resembling a Chinese palace, with its own fiberglass “rock” pool fed by hot spring water.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
The port area of Ampenan is crumbling and mostly disused, but the narrow streets of the old town are livelier. Many of the people here are descended from Arab traders — noticeable in the well-attended mosques and the cries of the muezzins in their minarets calling the faithful to prayer. A variety of so-called “antique” shops sell the odd interesting relic amid piles of dusty junk. The museum, which is south of the center on Jalan Banjar Tilar Negara, gives an overview of the island’s culture, as well as its unique and volatile ecology.<n>Mataram has the array of government institutions found in every Indonesian provincial capital, as well as tree-lined residential streets with many opulent houses. Cakranegara (or just Cakra — remember that it is pronounced “Chakra”) grew up around the palace of the Balinese rajas. Today it is the commercial center of Lombok. All that remains today of the royal compound is the 1744 Mayura Water Palace, the former meeting hall and court of justice standing in the middle of a lake and reached by a causeway guarded by old cannons. This was the scene of a short-lived Balinese victory over Dutch troops in 1894. The result was reversed only weeks later and the Dutch went on to take over the whole island.<n>Across the way, Pura Meru, the biggest temple in Lombok, was built in 1720. It has three meru-topped shrines dedicated to Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu. The huge wooden drums in the outer courtyard are sounded, calling the Hindu community to festivals and ceremonies. Just to the east, Sweta buzzes with bemos, buses, and pony-powered cidomos.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
For all of Barcelona’s exuberant architecture, the city’s modern district is a model of rationalist urban planning, a rigid geometric grid dryly called “the Extension.” The outrageous and conservative, one learns, coexist here without much fuss.<n>Barcelona’s expansion came about in a remarkable burst of urban development. By the mid-1800s Barcelona was bursting at the seams and suffocating inside its ring of medieval walls. A municipal competition was held in 1859 to select a plan for a new quarter between the old city and the Collserola hills. The job went to a road engineer named Ildefons Cerdà, whose plan quintupled the city’s size in a matter of decades. Eixample construction by elite Barcelonans transformed the city into a showcase of extravagant modernista architecture, and the swank Passeig de Gràcia became the place to be seen. Barcelona used the 1888 Universal Exposition as an open house to show the world its new face.<n>The place to begin a modernista tour is definitely on Passeig de Gracia and its single, hallucinatory block popularly known as Manzana de la Discordia (“Block of Discord”) between Consell de Cent and Aragó. (In Spanish the word for “apple” and “street block” are the same  — manzana — allowing for a play on words alluding to the apple in Greek mythology, which was awarded to the most beautiful among three goddesses — a contest that led inevitablyto trouble.)<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
Since the time of the First Opium War (1839–1842), Western nations had been pushing China to open its doors to foreign trade. In 1860, during the Second Opium War, British and French troops forcibly occupied Beijing and exacted treaty rights. Foreign delegations, businesses, and missionaries poured into the capital, taking up residence in the Legation Quarter, located just southeast of the Forbidden City.<n>In 1900 the Legation Quarter was attacked by the Boxers, a radical nationalist group that had the tacit support of the Qing court. In retaliation for this unsuccessful attempt to expel Westerners from Beijing, military forces representing the eight foreign nations resident in the capital went on a rampage, destroying the national library and even setting fire to the Summer Palace. Thereafter, the Legation Quarter exercised complete control over its own affairs, becoming its own foreign city within the city of Beijing. Many of the European-style embassy buildings, offices, banks, hotels, and mansions of the period have survived, although all have been converted to other uses since the revolution of 1949.<n>Republicans and Warlords<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-History.txt
The Chinese Communist party first initiated a popular program of reconstruction to transform and modernize the nation. In Beijing, the ancient city walls were pulled down and the city moat was filled in. Only a few of the venerable city gates and towers remain standing today. China’s first subway system now makes a loop that retraces the foundations of the city walls, with the subway stops named for the ancient city gates. Tiananmen Square was substantially enlarged, Chang’an Avenue widened, the Great Hall of the People built, the Museum of History and the Museum of the Revolution opened — all in the 1950s. Old neighborhoods began to be replaced by modern brick-and-concrete highrises. Beijing became its own powerful municipality (not part of any province), the seat of the new revolutionary government for the nation.<n>The Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) closed Beijing’s doors to the outside world. Mao and his most radical followers shut down the nation’s institutions and went on a witch hunt for those alleged to harbor politically incorrect thoughts, behaviors, or backgrounds (which at times seemed to include anyone not waving Mao’s Little Red Book). Many of Beijing’s temples and historic sites were not only closed but severely damaged, all in the name of making a complete break with the feudal, superstitious past. Renovations as a result of this era of cultural destruction are not yet complete, and some ancient sites have never reopened.<n>Nevertheless, after the death of Chairman Mao (whose mausoleum on Tiananmen Square has become a much-visited modern monument to China’s modern “emperor”), Beijing entered a period of liberal economic reform that has again transformed the capital. Under “supreme leader” Deng Xiaoping, China opened its doors to Western investment and culture in the 1980s.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-History.txt
Western Hills<n>When China’s rulers really wanted to escape the heat of the city, they went farther west than the Summer Palace to the Western Hills (Xi Shan), romantically known today as Fragrant Hills Park (Xiangshan Gong yuan). Imperial villas first dotted these hillsides — 27 km (17 miles) from Beijing — more than 800 years ago. But it was the Qing Emperor Qianlong who converted the Western Hills into a formal mountain retreat for the enjoyment of the court, complete with its own temples, lakes, gardens, and even a zoo. Late autumn is the favorite season for park visitors these days, when leaves turn a fiery red. However, locals as well as tourists come to the Western Hills year round for the natural beauty and historic sites.<n>Two renowned temples still survive in the Western Hills. Near the park’s north gate are the four great halls of the Temple of the Sleeping Buddha (Wo Fo Si). In the final hall (Wo Fo Dian) there is a 5-m (16-ft) lacquered statue of the reclining Buddha (dated 1321) about to attain nirvana.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt
The Third Reich<n>Communist hostility towards the Social Democrats split the opposition to the Nazis. Hitler became Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Only a month later, on 27 February, the Reichstag went up in flames. Hitler used the fire as a pretext to eliminate Communist and all left-wing opposition from German political life. The Nazi reign of terror had begun.<n>Flames were the leitmotiv of the Third Reich in Berlin. On 10 May 1933, a procession brought thousands of students along Unter den Linden to the square before Humboldt University. They carried books, not to a lecture but to a bonfire on which were burned the works of Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, Stefan Zweig, Albert Einstein, and Sigmund Freud, as well as Proust, Zola, Gide, H.G. Wells, and Jack London.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt

They carried books, not to a lecture but to a bonfire on which were burned the works of Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, Stefan Zweig, Albert Einstein, and Sigmund Freud, as well as Proust, Zola, Gide, H.G. Wells, and Jack London.<n>In 1936 a flame was brought from Athens to Berlin to inaugurate the Olympic Games, an attempt at Aryan propaganda which was soundly destroyed by black athlete Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals. In deference to foreign visitors, all anti-Semitic signs such as Juden unerwünscht (Jews not wanted) were removed from shops, hotels, and cafés. As soon as the foreigners had left town, the signs went up again.<n>Discrimination against Jews moved inexorably to the night of 9 November 1938, when synagogues and other Jewish-owned buildings were burned. In the midst of the smashed glass of the looted shops, German wit eased the discomfort by referring to the event as Kristallnacht (Crystal Night). Berlin’s Jewish population, which stood at 170,000 in 1933, was reduced by emigration and extermination to around 6,000 by 1945.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt
The gate itself, designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, was built between 1789 and 1791. With two rows of six Doric columns forming the gateway proper, it was inspired by the Propylaeum gatehouse leading to the Parthenon in Athens. (To go all the way, Hitler had even planned to hoist the gate onto an artificial hill, in an attempt to create a mini-Acropolis.) Forming part of the city wall, the gate was intended by the more pragmatic Prussians not so much as a triumphal arch as an imposing tollgate for collecting duties.<n>The gate was left isolated in no-man’s land when the Wall went up, and subsequently became the scene of quite ecstatic celebrations when it came down, though now you would scarcely believe it as Berliners cross nonchalantly from east to west through Brandenburg’s mighty central arch.<n>The new US Embassy is being built nearby, on land originally occupied by that country’s pre-war embassy, and a large stretch of ground leading towards Potsdamer Platz has been designated as the site of a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
King James added the name of Bermuda to the original Virginia Company Charter, and in the spring of 1612 more than 50 colonists were sent out on the Plough to join three pioneers who had volunteered to hold the fort. Defenses were built and the town of St. George’s was established at the east end of Bermuda, near the spot where the Sea Venture castaways had first landed. The Bermuda Company was then created to administer the island.<n>News of the British settlement agitated the Spanish. After all, a Spaniard had discovered (and given his name to) Bermuda. Philip III of Spain was urged by his advisors to act immediately to force the British out. Two ships were dispatched with orders to evaluate the situation. As they approached the island, the small British population created a number of ruses to convince the Spanish that Bermuda was well defended; two salvos fired from a cannon went across the bay. The Spanish fell for the ploy and fled, grossly overestimating the strength of the English garrison, which couldn’t have mustered a third shot at that time. Bermuda’s Britishness was affirmed.<n>A Growing Colony<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-history.txt
A Growing Colony<n>Progress was swift during the first few years of the colony’s existence. In 1619 the congregation of St. Peter’s Church moved into a permanent building, and Bermuda’s parliament met in an enclosure still visible amid the pews. But it was soon decided to separate the secular from the religious, and a new government building went up. State House, Bermuda’s first stone structure, is still standing today in St. George’s.<n>An English surveyor, Richard Norwood, undertook a study of the terrain, dividing the colony into the nine “tribes” that are the parishes (counties) of today and the origin of the numerous “Tribe Roads” still to be seen across the island. Of the nine parishes, all but St. George’s were named after prominent shareholders in the original Bermuda Company.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-history.txt
During this period local money was minted, called “Hog” money after the wild pig on the reverse side; it was Britain’s first colonial currency. Agriculture was to be the economic base for the new colony, whose major crop was tobacco. In reality, Bermuda could never compete with the crops produced in Virginia, but it began to develop a plantation system, including the importation of slave labor. The slaves were treated a bit better than were those on islands farther south, and slavery was finally abolished in Britain (and Bermuda) in 1834. The initial centuries of enforced settlement, followed by emancipation and the ensuing years of equality, have produced Bermuda’s modern biracial society.<n>When agriculture failed to be profitable, the ingenious settlers looked for other ways to make a living. Bermuda sits astride the main whale migration route, and because the motherland and other colonies demanded (and paid well for) the oil, the local population went into the whaling business. Once the colonists were good enough seamen to land whales, it was perhaps only natural that they might turn their skills to another historical marine tradition: piracy. The practice evolved modestly, perhaps even legally, from the salvaging (called “wrecking”) of treasure found on ships grounded on the local reefs. From there it was easy to make the transition to taking goods by subterfuge or by force. Smuggling was so commonplace that it passed almost unnoticed.<n>Changing Loyalties<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-history.txt
From the bank, head for Queen Street, which leads north from the Birdcage, a metal cage once used by police officers to direct the traffic that regularly comes to a halt on Front Street. It was designed by a Mr. Bird, although it also has a resemblance to “Tweetie Bird’s” cage. Traffic lights now regulate the junction. Remember to look right as you prepare to cross the road!<n>On the left as you walk up Queen Street is Perot Post Office, named after the man who was appointed Bermuda’s first Postmaster General in 1821. He had actually been acting as “unofficial” postman for several years, meeting the ships and putting the letters under his hat before touring the town to deliver them. William B. Perot (pronounced “Pea-rut”) went one stage further in 1848 when he began to produce his own postage stamps; only 11 are known to exist today, making each one extremely valuable. The little Post Office is very much as Perot kept it, neat and simply furnished. The building still houses an active post office, which makes it an appropriate place to buy the stamps for your postcards. Bermudian stamps always have a colorful and interesting design; perhaps you can start a collection by buying a set for yourself.<n>Just behind the Post Office is a building that houses the Bermuda National Library and the Historical Society Museum, prime collections devoted to important historical documents and artifacts from the island. The public rooms are small but full of Bermudian treasures. Silver, china, coins, and furniture have been gathered together, including rare and valuable “hog” money as well as some of the Confederate notes that were used to pay for goods before the Civil War. Many Bermudian businessmen and sailors were paid in money that became worthless after the Unionists won the war.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
A Bewitching City<n>In Salem magic bookshops, fortune tellers, a witch house, dungeon, and museum all recall the town’s witchcraft trials of 1692, but there is much more to this town than witches. Start at the National Park Visitors Center at Museum Place (on Essex Street), where you can pick up some literature and a map of the Heritage Trail. Visit the outstanding Peabody Essex Museum, where the exhibits tell the story of the development of this very wealthy seaport town, which produced America’s first millionaire, Elias Hesketh Derby. Kids always love the Salem Witch Museum, a diorama show that tells the story of the witch hysteria when 19 people went to the gallows.<n>Go beyond these sights to Nathaniel Hawthorne’s House of the Seven Gables. Hawthorne of course worked at the Custom House and was also born in one of the houses nearby.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
Peace lasted for the rest of the century and the country made great economic strides as a province of the Habsburg empire. Factories, theatres, and newspapers were opened and Pest expanded its role in international trade while Buda regained its status as Hungary’s administrative centre.<n>But prosperity was not for the majority. The rich were getting richer while the serfs were getting poorer, and the Magyar identity was being repressed by the influence of the Germanic Habsburgs. In the mid-19th century, the Hungarians once again went to war for their independence.<n>The rebellion of 1848 was led by a group of young intellectuals, including the 25-year-old radical poet, Sándor Petoﬁ. A provisional government was formed, headed by Lajos Kossuth, but it was short-lived. The Emperor Franz Joseph I summoned help from the Czar of Russia and the revolt was crushed in 1849.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-History.txt
But the big news was railways. The first, in 1836, was the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad, a few miles of track between Montréal and Lake Champlain. By 1854 more than 250 miles joined Niagara and Windsor. The dream of a transcontinental railway with freight revenues drew financiers to the Grand Trunk project to join up Montréal, the Great Lakes, and the western hinterland. But initially they had to content themselves with luring American trade to the St. Lawrence by linking eastern Canadian cities to Portland, Maine.<n>Choosing a permanent capital for these United Provinces wasn’t easy. In the perennial Anglo-French conflict, bilingual Montréal was too troublesome, while English-speaking Toronto or French-speaking Québec City would favor one community at the expense of the other. Royal Engineer officers sent watercolors of likely sites for Queen Victoria’s approval. The choice went to Bytown, a puny lumber depot renamed Ottawa after the river on which it stood, diplomatically situated between Upper and Lower Canada.<n>To the east, and remote from the centers of power, the people of Newfoundland and the Maritime Provinces lived in small, isolated communities with no unifying geography comparable to the Great Lakes or St. Lawrence River. Newfoundland turned its back on the hostile interior to reap the harvests of the sea. Always psychologically closer to London than to Ottawa, Newfoundland did not become part of Canada until 1949. Yankee Loyalists struggled valiantly with a region they called Nova Scarcity. The British had scattered Nova Scotia’s French Acadians, some to the nearby islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon (still French today), others as far as Louisiana, while a small nucleus remained in New Brunswick. The potential of Prince Edward Island’s fertile soil was squandered by absentee land speculators who milked it only for the rent and left the settlers no motivation to develop it.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt
Our popular image of the North American Indian is conditioned by Hollywood’s stereotype — feather headdress, necklace of scalps, and whooping war dances around the campfire — which in fact derived from the prairie tribes, or Plains Indians, as they are known to American anthropologists. The Blackfoot of Alberta are a classic example. Their name, says the myth, was bestowed on them when an ancestor, on his way to meet another tribe, walked through land burned by prairie fire and blackened his moccasins.<n>For these great hunters of the Rocky Mountain foothills and prairies, wild game included grizzly and black bear, antelope, deer, elk, wild sheep, and goats, but the only “real meat” was buffalo. Before the early 1700s, when horses appeared on the scene, guile was more important than speed, and hunters stalked the buffalo herd disguised with the skins of wolf and buffalo calves. Horseback hunting brought new skills and prestige to an élite that had been given no other duties. The Blackfoot went to war with Shoshoni and Crow Indians, to the south, for their horses, and were in turn attacked by the Cree from the north for their territory’s great buffalo herds. Buffalo was everything to these tribes — food, clothes, and tents; and twelve to fourteen buffalo skins were needed to construct a single teepee. So the cultural and ecological shock was all the greater when the herds were exterminated in the 1870s. Métis and Cree Indians were devastatingly efficient with their repeater rifles, and the transcontinental railway builders made a deliberate policy of clearing the tracks of migrating buffalo. By 1877, under the Canadian government’s Blackfoot Treaty, the native peoples gave up their hunting grounds to raise cattle on reserves instead.<n>The Micmac<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt
This is the grand parade drive along the Ottawa River to the town’s smartest residential neighborhood, home of ministers and “Embassy Row.”<n>The Neo-Gothic Basilica of Notre-Dame (Sussex at Guigues) was born with the capital. The Catholic cathedral’s steeples went up in 1858, though the whole church was not completed until 1890. Québec sculptors Louis Philippe Hébert, Philippe Parizeau, and Flavien Rochon carved the pulpit, choir stalls, organ loft, and bas-reliefs.<n>Turn off on St. Patrick Street to drive through Nepean Point Park to a statue of Samuel de Champlain, founder of Québec, who looks west along the Ottawa River with his Huron Indian scout. Here he still has the astrolabe that he lost on his explorations. and which gave its name to the nearby Astrolabe Amphitheatre, attractive setting for summer open-air concerts.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The Photographs Collection covers the history of the art from William Henry Fox Talbot through Eugène Atget, Walker Evans, and August Sander to the contemporary work of Diane Arbus and Paul Diamond.<n>The august Victoria Memorial Building at Metcalfe and McLeod Streets houses museums created with the treasures uncovered by the Geological Survey of 1841, predating the foundation of Canada itself. The survey went beyond geology and mineralogy to study the uncharted country’s paleontology and anthropology, its climate, forestry, and botany. In the National Museum of Natural Sciences in the east wing, the star attraction is Dinosaur Court, devoted to the 75,000,000-year-old beasts excavated in Alberta. The museum is a good place to look at the country’s rich wildlife as a primer to your own explorations of the Canadian forests and mountains.<n>The National Museum of Science and Technology (1867 St. Laurent Boulevard) is in the style of science through fun and games. In Canada’s largest museum, there are views of the heavens through a huge refracting telescope, do-it-yourself demonstrations of balance and optics, and a plastic bubble with live chicks hatching in front of your eyes. But with all the new-fangled razzmatazz, the museum hasn’t forgotten the charm of mint-condition antique cars and, above all, old train engines — behemoths from the great era of steam that truly “made” Canada.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The queen Latinized in the provincial capital’s name is, of course, Victoria. The city’s decorum would please her. It’s been cleaned up considerably since the first settlers arrived in the 1880s and found the banks of the Wascana Creek littered with hundreds of buffalo bones. Indian hunters used to dry their buffalo meat and stretch the hides by the creek, and left the bones in a heap. The town was known as Pile of Bones until they were ground up for fertilizer.<n>Today, you’ll find the buffalo, along with other regional wildlife, prehistoric and present-day, in the Museum of Natural History, on Albert Street. The museum is south of the city center in the very pretty Wascana Park, one of the few places in southern Saskatchewan where you’ll see any trees. The creek has been dammed to form a lake, with a bird sanctuary out on Willow Island. Also in the park is the provincial Legislative Building, with an interesting portrait gallery of Indian chiefs on the ground floor. On Lakeview Drive is the Diefenbaker Homestead, brought here from near Saskatoon to give a vivid insight into the simple country life led by Saskatchewan’s most famous son before he went off to Ottawa “to show them Yanks and Ruskies a thing or two.”<n>Headquarters of the famous Mounties in the 1880s until moved to Ottawa, Regina keeps the Royal Canadian Mounted Police College as a major training center (north of the airport at the end of 11th Avenue). Visit the barracks, crime laboratories, and Centennial Museum, which traces Mountie history from the first clashes with gold-rush panhandlers to wartime reconnaissance and latter-day counter-espionage. The old mess hall is now the “Little Chapel on the Square,” where the stained-glass windows portray not saints but Mounties, notably a reveille bugler and guard in mourning. At Government House (Dewdney Avenue, corner of Pasqua Street), you can see dramatizations of Louis Riel’s treason trial.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Though their antecedents are still shadowy, they were much influenced by the Olmec. They developed and refined the Olmec calendar and counting system, and improved their building practices. The whole Yucatán peninsula witnessed the flowering of classic Mayan civilization and a society of great sophistication; with its magnificent pyramids, temples, and palaces decorated with wall paintings and carved low-reliefs, a written language of hieroglyphics, and complicated medical procedures to heal the injured or the sick. Mayan astronomers tracked the movements of the heavenly bodies, predicting eclipses and marking the times for the planting of the new corn. In fact, corn came to symbolize life for the Maya — in their myths of creation, mankind was formed from lumps of maize dough. Elaborate rituals grew up around the preparation of the milpas (cornfields) and the planting and harvesting of the crop whose success depended on the coming of the annual rains. These rituals were undertaken by a small number of initiates who controlled the knowledge of the Maya. Because the region has no surface rivers, rain was a precious resource and the Maya saw any stock of water, such as the limestone water holes or cenotes, as holy places. The rain god Chaac was a very important deity, whose image can be seen at every Mayan site.<n>But there was a dark side to this sophisticated society. The Maya viewed their gods not as benevolent guides but as changeable spirits in need of constant appeasement. To incur the wrath of the gods would result in drought, a loss of crops, and certain starvation. To keep the gods happy, the people offered sacrifices at their great pyramid temples. The ceremonies were overseen by a powerful caste of high priests. Grain and animals were used, but the gods came to demand more, and a cult of human sacrifice grew. The Maya went out on raiding parties, taking hostages from the surrounding lands to use in their bloody ceremonies. The murals and reliefs at Mayan cities tell gory tales of beheading and the tearing out of human hearts to appease the lords of the underworld. Archaeologists dredging the Sacred Cenote of Chichén Itzá have recovered dozens of human skeletons, thought to be the remains of victims sacrificed to the rain god.<n>Mayan civilization in the northern Yucatán reached its peak around a.d. 900–1200. For reasons still unknown — perhaps civil war, drought, or disease — the great cities were abandoned. By the time the Spaniards arrived in the early 16th century the jungle was reclaiming the pyramids; the richly painted murals of warriors, Mayan lords, animals, and gods were already crumbling and dissolving in the warm rain. The priest caste seemed to have vanished, along with their knowledge. The only people the Spanish found were farmers.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt
In the Wake of Cortés<n>The first recorded Europeans to arrive in the Yucatán, in 1511, were doubly unfortunate: a group of Spanish sailors survived a shipwreck on the coast of what is now Quintana Roo, only to be sacrificed by the Mayan natives. However, two were allowed to live as slaves and one, Gonzalo Guerrero, went native and married the chief’s daughter. His children were the first mestizos — the people of mixed Indian and Spanish blood who now make up 55 percent of the Mexican population.<n>In 1517, an expedition led by Francisco Hernandez de Cordobá landed on the west coast of the Yucatán, near Campeche, but were beaten back by a hail of arrows from the hostile natives. However, the following year, ambitious, young Captain Juan de Grijalva discovered the island of Cozumel and skirted the coast of the peninsula, hearing tales from the Indians of the great civilization of the Aztecs. Here, they told him, you can find a city made of gold.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt
Grijalva’s stories focused Spanish attention on central Mexico, and in 1519 Hernan Cortés landed in Veracruz, to start an expedition that would end in the conquest of Moctezuma and the Aztec Empire. Though he had begun his campaign without the King’s authority, once news of the treasures captured by Cortés reached Madrid, a royal warrant was dispatched to legitimize the victory and create “New Spain” — the latest Spanish colony. However, it was left to Don Francisco de Montejo, “a gentleman of Seville,” following in the great conquistador’s wake, to take possession of the Yucatán in the name of the Spanish king.<n>Arriving on the coast in 1527, Montejo’s forces were hindered by the dense jungle and withering climate, and were met by fierce resistance from the natives. To make matters worse, news of great riches discovered in Peru led many of his men to desert in search of greater rewards. The campaign went so badly that by 1535 the Spaniards had been completely driven out of the Yucatán.<n>In 1537 another force, under the command of Montejo el Mozo (the Younger), Don Francisco’s son, set out to plant the Spanish standard on Yucatecan soil. At first ill fortune dogged them; the dwindling force was besieged in Champotón, on the west coast, for two miserable years. With reinforcements, the Spaniards managed to establish a beachhead. A band of only 57 men, led by Montejo el Mozo’s cousin (yet another Don Francisco), marched inland to take the Mayan village of T’Ho. The Indians gathered their forces for one last great battle, and thousands of them fell upon the Spanish camp, now defended by 200 men. The horses and superior weaponry of the Spaniards gave them the edge, and they slaughtered hundreds of Indian warriors. After the battle, local chiefs made peace with the invaders and, on 6 January 1542, the Montejos founded the Spanish city of Mérida on the site.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt
Mao Zedong’s “Great Leap Forward” (1959) was designed to mobilize the masses in a crash program of economic growth, but it kept the country in turmoil and brought unconvincing results. At about the time the Leap was suddenly reversed, relations between China and the Soviet Union plunged from polite to frosty to hostile. China cut off relations with the world and tested its own nuclear bomb.<n>From 1966 to 1976, China was convulsed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Millions of young Red Guards went on the rampage, and the whole country set about memorizing the maxims in Mao’s Little Red Book. Thousands perished and much of China’s cultural heritage was destroyed as a vestige of feudalism. Changes came in quick succession in the 1970s. The US president, Richard Nixon, visited China in 1972, thus normalizing relations between the two countries. In early 1976 the widely admired prime minister, Zhou Enlai, died. Eight months later, in September, death came to Chairman Mao himself.<n>Mao’s widow, the one-time film actress Jiangqing, and her close associates (the so-called Gang of Four) were arrested, tried, and imprisoned for encouraging the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. Thousands who had suffered during the fervid 1960s and 1970s, including the forceful pragmatist Deng Xiaoping, were rehabilitated. At the same time as Mao Zedong’s portraits and slogans were being removed from billboards and schoolrooms, a new flexibility was coming to the fore. Top priority was now assigned to the modernization of China’s underdeveloped economy. This opened the way for major scientific and commercial exchanges with the West. And foreign tourists soon began flooding into the country to see the splendors that had been inaccessible for so long.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-History.txt
Soon a modern, German-style city was built, with villas, a deepwater port, a cathedral, and a main street called Kaiser Wilhelmstrasse. Business was not everything: the Germans used Qingdao as a missionary base, too. It remains one of China’s more Christian cities. The twin-spired Catholic cathedral (Tianzhu Jiaotong) and the Protestant church (Jidu Jiaotong), with its working clock tower, tend to be crowded with local people on Sundays and have become tourist attractions.<n>German Qingdao suffered a curious fate during World War I. Japan, which joined the Allied forces, invaded the city, imprisoned the survivors of the German garrison, and occupied Qingdao for the duration of the war. China wasn’t able to regain sovereignty until 1922. After the Communists came to power in 1949, industrial development went forward. However, even though the population now exceeds 4 million (including the outlying regions), Qingdao keeps its quiet allure.<n>As permanent as any of the German contributions to Qingdao is its brewing prowess. The local beer has become China’s national beer, exported worldwide in big green bottles or modern cans under the old spelling of the town’s name, “Tsingtao.” Brewery tours can be arranged, and the Qingdao International Beer Festival in mid-August has become China’s first attempt at an “Oktoberfest.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Ningbo (Ningpo), Zhejiang Province. Situated down the coast from Shanghai, this port town has a long history of overseas connections. First it was involved in trade with Japan. Then the Portuguese arrived and settled here. Finally, a British consulate was established in the town after the end of the Opium Wars. The sights include a thousand-year-old wooden temple and a Ming Dynasty library in a pretty garden.<n>Qufu (Chufu), Shandong Province. The birthplace of Confucius has been turned into an architectural ensemble on the scale of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The memorial temple was begun in 478 b.c., the year after the philosopher’s death, and improvements and expansions went on for another 2,000 years. The compound itself contains ceremonial gateways, palaces, pavilions, and shrines. The tombs of Confucius and most of his descendants are set among ancient pines and cypress to the north of the town.<n>Shanhaiguan (Shanhaikuan), Hebei Province. This walled town’s strategic location made it the site of many important battles over thousands of years. But it is best known as the eastern terminus of the Great Wall. Five huge Chinese characters meaning “The First Pass Under Heaven” mark the two-tiered gate-tower as the starting point of the Wall. Just south of Shanhaiguan is the Bohai Gulf port of Qinhuangdao.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Hopes of setting up a constitutional monarchy were quickly dashed, and Spain was plunged into a century of power struggles at home. Overseas, her American colonies revolted and gained independence. Soon there was little left of the once great Spanish empire, and an attempt in 1873 to form a republic failed. In 1902, Alfonso XIII became king at the age of 16. His reign was a difficult time for Spain; prosperity and stability eluded the country, which remained neutral during World War I.<n>In 1923, assailed by economic problems and with catastrophe imminent, the king accepted a general, Miguel Primo de Rivera, as dictator. Six years later the opposition of radical forces resulted in Primo de Rivera’s fall. Neither reform nor the maintenance of order seemed possible. In 1931 the king himself went into exile following anti-royalist election results, and another republic was founded.<n>Parliamentary democracy was impeded by the ideological commitment of various political factions and compromise was rare. There was a succession of right-wing attempts to govern and Spain floundered in a sea of political strikes and violence. Then the Left won the 1936 elections and was immediately in violent collision with the Right.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-History.txt
With the introduction of a sophisticated irrigation system, crops such as rice, cotton, and sugar cane were cultivated for the first time on Spanish soil, as well as oranges, peaches, and pomegranates. The manufacture of paper and glass was another Moorish innovation. Skilled engineers and architects, the Moors built numerous palaces and fortifications. As superb craftsmen they excelled in the production of ceramics and tooled leather, as well as delicate silverware.<n>The ensuing fall of Córdoba was as remarkable as its rise. In 1009, the caliphate splintered into a number of small kingdoms called taifas, which were constantly at war. The Christians in the north, seeing the enemy weakened and divided, captured the taifa of Toledo. Under threat of attack, the other taifas sought help from the Almoravids, fanatical Berber warriors. The Berbers marched against the Christians in 1086, and went on to reduce Moorish Spain to a province of their own North African Empire.<n>For a time, therefore, the affairs of Muslim Spain were administered from the Almoravid headquarters in Granada, until they lost their grip on the peninsula, softened by their life of ease in Andalucía. The pattern repeated itself a century later when the Moors invoked the aid of the Almohads in 1151. These primitive tribesmen, who came from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, soon made themselves the masters of southern Spain. They constructed major fortifications, such as Sevilla’s Alcázar, endowing the Moors with sufficient strength to resist the Christian forces a while longer.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt
The Golden Age<n>With the triumph of Christianity, the country was united under the Catholic Monarchs (Los Reyes Católicos), a title conferred by Pope Alexander VI on Ferdinand II of Aragón and Isabella I of Castile. Also in 1492, Cristobal Colón (Christopher Columbus) discovered the New World in the name of the Spanish crown. Fanatical in their religious zeal, the king and queen expelled all Jews who refused to convert to Christianity in the same year, and the Moors followed in 1502. The rulers thus reneged on the promise of religious freedom they had given when Granada surrendered. With the Jews who left Spain went many of the country’s bankers and merchants, and with the Moors, a good number of its agriculturists and laborers. The converted Jews (conversos) and Moors (Moriscos) who remained in Spain were viewed with suspicion by the Inquisition, which had been established by the Catholic Monarchs to stamp out heresy. Many were condemned to death, and still more fled the country to escape persecution.<n>The 16th century was glorious for Spain, with the conquest of the New World bringing much prestige and wealth. In 1503, the Casa de Contratación in Sevilla was awarded a monopoly on trade with Spain’s territories in the Americas. For more than two centuries, Sevilla was the richest city in Spain.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt
By comparison, the coastal settlements languished, and were subject to frequent raids by Barbary pirates. Under constant threat for more than 200 years, the population drifted inland, taking refuge in fortified towns and villages hidden in the foothills of the Sierras.<n>As Emperor, Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire, the first Habsburg Spanish king, turned his attention to events in Europe. Between 1521 and 1556, he went to war with France four times, squandering the riches of the Americas on endless military campaigns. Charles also had a weakness for such costly projects as his vast Renaissance palace on the grounds of the Alhambra, which he commissioned in 1526. Taxes imposed on the Moors served to finance the building works, which eventually had to be abandoned for lack of funds when the Moriscos revolted 12 years into the reign of Philip II (1556–1598). The king dispatched his half-brother, Don Juan of Austria, to quell the rebellion, which ended in 1570 with the defeat of the Moriscos and their eventual dispersal. In 1588, Philip II prepared to invade England, only to be repulsed when the English navy destroyed Spain’s previously invincible Armada.<n>The defeat marked the start of a long decline. Philip’s military forays and his expensive taste left Spain encumbered with debts. Participation in the Thirty Years’ War under Philip III led to further financial difficulties and to another debacle in 1643, when Spanish troops were defeated by the French at Rocroi in Flanders, never to regain their prestige.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt
On the Andalucían coast, the 19th century was a time of tentative expansion. With piracy at an end, a number of towns and villages grew up along the shoreline, and the extension of the railway line to Almería in 1899 promoted the early development of the eastern region.<n>Alfonso XIII, just 16 years old, assumed the crown in 1902. Prosperity and stability continued to elude the country, which remained neutral during World War I. Against a murky background of violence, strikes, and regional strife, the king accepted the dictatorship of General Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1923. Seven years later, the opposition of radical forces toppled Primo de Rivera from power. Alfonso XIII went into exile following anti-royalist election results in 1931, and another republic was founded.<n>Parliamentary elections in 1933 resulted in a swing to the right, and public opinion became polarized. When the left came out on top in the elections of 1936, the situation deteriorated at an alarming rate. It came as no surprise when, six months later, General Francisco Franco led a large section of the army against the socialist government. Support for the Franco-led nationalist uprising came from monarchists, conservatives, and the right-wing Falangist organization, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, while liberals, socialists, Communists, and anarchists sided with the government.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt
Parliamentary elections in 1933 resulted in a swing to the right, and public opinion became polarized. When the left came out on top in the elections of 1936, the situation deteriorated at an alarming rate.

Support for the Franco-led nationalist uprising came from monarchists, conservatives, and the right-wing Falangist organization, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, while liberals, socialists, Communists, and anarchists sided with the government.<n>The bloodshed lasted no less than three years and cost hundreds of thousands of lives. General Franco emerged as the leader of a shattered Spain. Many Republicans went into exile; others simply disappeared. The Republican mayor of Mijas caused a sensation when he finally surfaced in the 1960s after three decades in hiding — in his own home. Franco kept Spain out of World War II, despite Hitler’s entreaties to the contrary. The Spanish nation gradually healed its wounds, though conditions in the country were difficult and life was far from easy.<n>Changing Fortunes<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt
Founded by Phoenician traders more than 3,000 years ago, it came under Carthaginian and Roman rule before falling to the Moorish invasion force in 711. The Moors fortified the city, developing the settlement into a major trading port serving Granada, and it was one of the last cities in Spain to be re-conquered by Christian forces in 1487.<n>A good place to begin a tour is at Málaga’s principle landmark, Gibralfaro (from the Arabic Jebel al Faro — Lighthouse Hill). Located some 130 m (425 ft) above the city, this hilltop is capped by the ramparts of a Phoenician castle reconstructed in the 14th century by the Moors (who went on to build the lighthouse that gave Gibralfaro its name). The restored walls and parapets offer a superb panoramic view of both the city below and the coastline disappearing into the horizon. Because it looks down on the Plaza de Toros, the hill also acts as free seating for bullfights taking place below. Although it is possible to walk here, it is not recommended. Not only is the pathway somewhat difficult in places, it is also a well-known hangout for muggers. Best, then, to take a taxi.<n>Back at sea level is the delightful Paseo del Parque, with contrasting fountains at either end, which connects the old town with the Plaza de Toros. On its south side, it is a lush seaside tropical garden enhanced by fountains, duck ponds, and small bars. The other side is home to the smaller Jardínes Puerta Oscura and two impressive buildings, the Ayuntamiento (Town Hall) and the 18th-century La Aduana (Old Custom House).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Outskirts of Alicante<n>Outside town, on the main Valencia highway, the Monasterio de Santa Verónica (Saint Veronica’s Monastery) attracts about 15,000 pilgrims and a good many hawkers during the annual May celebration of the Santa Faz (Holy Face). Armed with canes decorated with bunches of rosemary, the participants proceed on foot to the monastery, where they venerate the Holy Face cloth that, according to tradition, retained the bloodstained image of Jesus’ face after Saint Veronica used it to wipe his brow as he went to Calvary.<n>The sacred relic was first worshipped in the Alicante region during a drought in 1489. As it was being carried across the site of the present-day monastery, the Santa Faz is said to have suddenly become too heavy to hold, and believers claim that a tear fell from the right eye of the image. This was interpreted as a sign to construct the building which has housed the cloth ever since. It can be seen at the high altar or in a chapel off the sacristy.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
The presence of such architectural wonders, no matter how dilapidated, led UNESCO to declare Old Havana a World Heritage Site in 1982. In the central tourist quarter, an expanding number of buildings are being spruced up with the assistance of UNESCO and foreign foundations, but many others are propped up by wooden columns, lean-tos that appear to be merely forestalling the inevitable. Their arcades, fluted pillars, and mosaic tiles are teetering on last legs, praying for restoration miracles. At night the deep darkness of the streets is punctuated only by the neon glow of TV sets from tiny front rooms and the occasional headlights of a small colony of gas-guzzling vintage Chevrolets and Plymouths.<n>Havana’s distant era lives on. Legendary places plucked from the pages of popular novels and the lives of fiction writers need little input from visitors to evoke their storied past: Graham Greene’s Hotel Sevilla, where “Our Man in Havana” went to meet his secret service contact, and Hemingway’s favorite watering holes (El Floridita and La Bodeguita del Medio) and the Hotel Ambos Mundos, where he penned much of For Whom the Bell Tolls.<n>Old Havana is best experienced on foot, although you can also pick up a bicitaxi (pedicab) to get to the Malecón or the museums at the district’s edge.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
War on the Mississippi<n>Less than two months after Louisiana won its statehood, the United States went to war with Britain — for the second and last time. To everyone’s surprise, New Orleans became the stage for the most glorious, indeed the only, American victory of the whole conflict.<n>The War of 1812 was fostered by accumulated American grievances. There were dramatic naval battles and a final ghastly defeat for the United States when the British burned down the city of Washington. Finally, the warring parties focused on New Orleans. A British flotilla, diverted from the Caribbean, sailed up the Mississippi with some 10,000 first-class troops. The Americans rushed Major General Andrew Jackson to New Orleans to command the city’s defense. Out-manned and outgunned, Jackson mobilized a force of somewhat irregular members: an unlikely coalition of militiamen, local Creoles, free blacks, Choctaws, and associates of the privateers Jean and Pierre Lafitte (see page 74). The pirates may well have been the key to the outcome, for they alone knew the ins and outs of the bayou country, from where the British attack would come.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_NewOrleans-History.txt
The powerful Prussians came up with a plan to partition Poland, which gained the support of the Russians. The imposed treaty in 1772 robbed Poland of nearly a third of its lands. Yet Poniatowski recovered to preside over a reform movement that precipitated the creation of the 1791 Constitution, which restored the hereditary monarchy and overhauled Poland’s political system. The liberal constitution, the oldest in the modern world after that of the United States, provided for the separation of powers among legislative, judicial and executive branches of the government.<n>None of these reforms pleased the Russians and Prussians, who continued to covet Polish territory. Russia invaded Poland and in 1792-1793 it, along with Prussia, imposed a second partition of Poland, annulling the constitution and essentially divying up the country between them. Tadeusz Ko§ciuszko, a hero of the American War of Independence, led a military insurrection in 1794, defeating the Russians with a mostly peasant army. The uprising was quashed, however, and in 1795, Poniatowski was forced to abdicate. A third partition crushed Poland and placed the country under the control of Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Poland ceased to exist — its very name was abolished by treaty — for the next 123 years. Warsaw went to Prussia, Kraków to Austria.<n>In desperation, Poland looked to Napoleon Bonaparte and Revolutionary France for assistance against its oppressors. Napoleon defeated the Prussian army in several key battles and established a semi-independent Duchy of Warsaw from 1807 to 1815. Napoleon gained an ally in Józef Poniatowski, a heralded military leader and the nephew of the last king. The 1812 Polish War re-established the Poland-Lithuania border, but Napoleon’s troops were crushed as they advanced on Moscow. Napoleon suffered a great defeat, but his ally Poniatowski refused to surrender, preferring to sacrifice himself and his troops. The suicidal mission became an important rallying cry for Poles during the remainder of the 19th century.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Poland-History.txt
The most significant expedition under Manuel’s flag was Vasco da Gama’s legendary sea voyage from Lisbon in the summer of 1497 — immortalized in The Lusiads (1572), the epic poem by Portugal’s national poet, Luís de Camões (1524–1580). Rounding what is now known as the Cape of Good Hope, da Gama found what Columbus had been searching for in 1492 (although in the wrong direction): the sea-route to the lucrative spices of the East. The Portuguese thus ended the Venetian monopoly on Eastern trade and began attracting merchants from all over Europe to Lisbon.<n>Portugal and Spain, the planet’s foremost maritime powers, agreed to divide the world between them by means of the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas. This accorded everything lying more than 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands to Spain, while everything lying to the east went to Portugal, thus giving Portugal a free hand in exploiting the Orient. In 1500, Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral accidentally reached Brazil.<n>Trading posts were set up all along the west and east coasts of Africa, in the Middle East (Hormuz), southern India (Goa), Malaysia (Malacca), and even in China (Macau). Profits came primarily from trading in eastern spices, silk and porcelain, African gold, and slaves, as well as through importing copious sugar from Brazil and São Tomé.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-History.txt
Washington gradually began to grant Puerto Ricans a greater degree of self-government and representation. In 1900 the first civil governor was appointed (all the appointed governors were Americans until 1946). In 1917 Puerto Ricans won a mixed bag of benefits: they were given more say in their internal affairs, made citizens of the United States — and declared eligible for conscription in World War I. In the years between the World Wars there were continued efforts to change the island’s status and improve its quality of life. Some, such as those who followed radical Pedro Albizu Campos, took to violence, which resulted in several assassinations, though many more insurgents worked within the system.<n>More Puerto Rican draftees went to war in 1941. Even while poverty lingered from the Great Depression, World War II caused continued hardship on the island because of its isolation in a dangerous sea. But the 1940s saw the emergence of two great political figures: Luis Muñoz Marín, son of Muñoz Marín Rivera and founder of the new Popular Democratic Party, and Rexford Guy Tugwell, Governor of Puerto Rico from 1941 to 1946. These two men were instrumental in orchestrating an amazing economic expansion that almost single-handedly converted the island from an underdeveloped backwater into a pace-setting industrial society. Under “Operation Bootstrap,” which attracted hundreds of new factories to Puerto Rico through tax and other incentives, the per-capita income soared to the highest in Latin America. Life expectancy rose from about 45 years in 1940 to an enviable 71 years today. Pouring one-third of its entire budget into education, Puerto Rico cut illiteracy to about 10 percent.<n>The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-History.txt
Old San Juan<n>Old San Juan is without doubt one of the most spectacular sights of the Caribbean. Founded in 1521, it is partially surrounded by walls and fortifications that have protected it from modernization and indiscriminate development. The carefully preserved historic houses and public buildings retain many of the most charming features of the original Spanish colonial architecture. Cobblestone streets (the stones were brought as ballast on the Spanish ships, which went home filled with treasure and gold), tiny squares, and grand plazas surprise visitors at every turn as they wander the neat grid of streets planned four centuries ago.<n>Only eight blocks wide, San Juan can easily be covered on foot, though there are some steep ascents that may be challenging in the Caribbean heat. Even if you only have one day, you’ll be able to enjoy its delights. If possible, however, take at least a couple of days. Enjoying a rest in a shady plaza or taking a long lunch at an outdoor café are just as much a part of your trip as a tour around the museums. San Juan is a living city, and it’s especially bustling after dark, when crowds throng to the bars and restaurants or simply stroll the narrow streets and airy plazas.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
The Nao trade route continued until the early 1800s, when José María Morelos y Pavón, a hero of Mexico’s War of Independence, took over Acapulco and stopped the trade, sending the town into a century-long respite, a hiatus that ended only when the Mexican government paved the highway between Mexico City and Acapulco. The beautiful beaches of Acapulco Bay immediately lured Mexico City’s elite, and the metamorphosis began, from slumbering trading port into the “Pearl of the Pacific,” as the media came to know it in the 1930s.<n>The first airplanes from the US began to arrive in the mid-1930s, and with them came a bevy of notorious visitors, from movie stars to presidents, writers to millionaires. Acapulco became the playground for the rich and famous. Glitzy hotels went up in a hurry, supported by new boulevards, power plants, and a superhighway. Acapulco’s peak was the 1940s to 1960s. Celebrated images included Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner sipping margaritas while watching cliff divers at La Quebrada, President Eisenhower meeting Mexico’s President López Mateos for a summit conference in a new high rise hotel, and Johnny Weissmuller swimming laps in the Flamingos Hotel pool overlooking Acapulco Bay.<n>Since those glory days Acapulco has aged — maybe not quite as gracefully as its fans would have hoped. However, the “Perla del Pacífico” still attracts scores of vacationers, who are still regaled by old stories about the rich and famous, told by seasoned waiters as they serve pool-side drinks with a weathered but unwavering smile.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-History.txt
