You have no objection to Pandas being in the library? [SEP] No, absolutely not. [SEP] I don't object to Pandas being in the library, just like I don't object to, you know, any of the other books being in the library, as long as -- as long as it's the appropriate level and -- you know, I mean, there is a censorship process that goes into putting books in the library. [SEP] So, I mean, as long as it has	gone	through that process and it's approved to be there, I don't have a problem with it being there. [SEP] The statement that the school district developed to be read as part of the biology class, is it your understanding that the statement that was drafted in January, 2005, or for use in January, 2005, was modified in June of 2005? [SEP] Are you aware of that?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	5

Governor, did the -- are the vice president's figures correct about Texas? [SEP] First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system? [SEP] I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system. [SEP] It was fortunately stopped in its tracks. [SEP] Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas. [SEP] Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has	gone	down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	5
New question, new subject. [SEP] Vice President Gore, on the environment. [SEP] In your 1992 book you said, quote, "We must make the rescue of our environment the central organizing principle for civilization and there must be a wrenching transformation to save the planet." [SEP] Do you still feel that way? [SEP] I do. [SEP] I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming. [SEP] There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely	gone	in 50 years. [SEP] Already people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they've never seen before in their lifetimes. [SEP] And what's happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly. [SEP] Now, here is the good news, Jim. [SEP] If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies. [SEP] You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this. [SEP] They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market.

Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country. [SEP] This president has taken a $5.

I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. [SEP] I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. [SEP] I voted for IRA tax cuts. [SEP] I voted for small-business tax cuts. [SEP] But you know why the Pell Grants have	gone	up in their numbers? [SEP] Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money. [SEP] But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. [SEP] They're getting less money.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	5
The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it's been since 1929. [SEP] And the take-home pay of the richest . [SEP] 1 percent of Americans is the highest it's been since 1928. [SEP] Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has	gone	down. [SEP] Now that's wrong. [SEP] Now, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform. [SEP] He said he would reform it. [SEP] Four years later he is now promising another plan.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	5
