The upshot of all this is that manufacturers need not hold the bag for lean retailers if they adopt a set of technologies and practices that allow them to collect and process demand information, incorporate it into planning, and use traditional and short-cycle production strategically. Simply doing business with lean retailers in no way confers competitive success. In fact, a supplier that attempts to provide rapid replenishment without any other innovations may end up performing poorly from the perspective of its retail customers. More important, it will sustain higher costs in inventories, face a greater need to mark down the prices of its products, and therefore earn a lower profit margin than those establishments that have invested in comprehensive changes.<n>Of course, becoming an advanced manufacturer is not just a matter of buying more information technologies or setting up a short-cycle assembly line. The essential force behind the performance impact of these practices is their effective integration with one another. Integration does not arise from hardware or software purchases. It comes from successful management.<n>We have already described some specific ways that managers can think about integration of new information technologies and manufacturing practices. Chapter 7 presented two production planning cases. The first indicated how managers must assess a product line according to the variance in demand for particular SKUs in setting inventory policies. The second case developed how suppliers must use this new perspective on demand to plan production or sourcing strategies. Both cases illustrate the necessity of creating managerial practices that explicitly link the data arising from information technology with changes in manufacturing practices to take full advantage of these innovations.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch14.txt
Proposition 3:  The assembly room—the traditional focus of attention for industry competitiveness—can provide competitive benefits only if other more fundamental changes in manufacturing practice have been introduced.<n>The inputs to garment production are relatively straightforward: fabric, thread, accessories like buttons and zippers, labor, and a modest level of capital investment. The majority of input costs are composed of materials and labor. For example, close to 50 percent of the value of shipments for men’s shirts comes from the cost of materials, while 25 percent arises from compensation costs.27 Reducing textile costs is a viable option for larger apparel manufacturers; they can exert some pressure on suppliers because of the size of their orders. Small manufacturers, however, have few such options. As a result, the conventional method of unit cost reduction revolves, once again, around reducing labor costs. Because the largest labor cost is concentrated in assembly phases, the focus of most productivity efforts has been in the sewing room.28<n>Garment assembly is typically done by “bundle” production, which entails breaking garment-making into a series of worksteps or operations. Each operation is assigned to a single worker, who receives a bundle of unfinished garment parts and undertakes her single operation on each item in the bundle. Completed bundles are then moved forward to the next operator in the production process. To foster productivity (physical output per worker) and constrain supervisory costs, wages are paid on a piece-rate basis, providing incentives for rapid completion of the operation.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt
Proposition 5:  Even with full implementation of GATT, a viable apparel industry can remain in North America, drawing on a range of production processes in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Latin America.<n>When it comes to international trade agreements, the conventional wisdom sounds most bleak. It leads to stark conclusions about the long-term viability of the U.S. apparel industry, even with steps taken to improve assembly-room productivity and fashion-oriented quick response. The following comment is typical:<n>Among the factors that are expected to have a substantial impact on employment in the textiles and apparel industries, perhaps the most influential will be the trade policy agreed to in the GATT.... The apparel industry, which is far more labor intensive and less competitive internationally than the textile industry, will probably sustain most of the losses from the new trade environment.34<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt
How This Book Is Organized<n>Because of our separate academic perspectives and disciplines, the research underlying A Stitch in Time comes from a variety of sources. Much of our analysis is based on detailed survey data we collected from 118 business units—a sample representing about one-third of the shipments—in the apparel industry. We supplemented the original survey with microdata collected from a variety of U.S. government and private sources. Our work also draws on numerous case studies of individual enterprises and data gathered at site visits. We have modeled specific channel dynamics in order to understand what optimal practices might look like as the channel develops over time. Finally, we have worked closely with business executives, government officials, labor leaders, and our academic colleagues to exchange views, test ideas, and refine our results on a continuing basis. The appendices present a list of acronyms, a description of the HCTAR survey and other data sources, and a list of companies that we visited or at which we conducted interviews with their executives.<n>A Stitch in Time is organized into five sections, roughly corresponding to the channel components. The first two chapters provide an overview and historical context. Chapters 3 through 5 analyze developments in the retail sector. Chapters 6 and 7 establish a bridge between retailing and apparel/textile operations through an exploration of the problems of inventory management—a central aspect of emerging channel dynamics. Chapters 8 through 10 focus on the apparel industry; Chapters 11 and 12 look at textiles. Chapters 13 through 15 examine the channel as a whole, from global, private-performance, and public-policy perspectives.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt
The jobber-contractor system developed to address many of the issues that still concern apparel-makers. It provided great flexibility in coping with fluctuations in style, season, and economic conditions; at the same time, jobbers did not take on the substantial costs of plant, equipment, or employees that “inside shop” manufacturers did. This system also separated and specialized the functions of production from the purchase of materials and the selling of finished products—developments that greatly influence women’s and children’s apparel today, including the complexity of the regulation of labor conditions.<n>Regardless, apparel operations in both the men’s and women’s segments have always been labor intensive; even with continual technological innovation, the work still comes down to cutting cloth and sewing pieces together into a garment. Although union organization has not been so extensive in retail or textiles, unions have been important players in apparel manufacturing. At the same time, apparel manufacturers have pressed for ever greater productivity on the shop floor, hoping to cut labor costs in a variety of ways. These two related historical issues—the ascendancy of a particular system of clothing assembly and the role of unions—have a direct bearing on what is now happening in retail-apparel-textile channels.<n>Development of the Progressive Bundle System<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
Significantly, it was in several of these [labor-intensive] more fragmented industries—textiles, apparel, furniture, and some food processing—that the mass retailer (the department stores, mail-order houses and chain stores) began to coordinate the flow of goods from manufacturer to consumer. In those industries where substantial economies of scale and scope did not exist in production, high-volume flows through the processes of production and distribution came to be guided—and the resulting cost reductions achieved—by the buying departments of mass retailers, retailers who handled a variety of related products through their facilities.43<n>And so we arrive at the new information technologies of the 1980s. These have begun to create integrated channels among enterprises in the three industries, facilitating even more product proliferation and stimulating changes in merchandising, inventory management, internal production practices, and methods of using human resources. When it comes to the driving force behind the late twentieth-century industrial transformation, lean retailing is at the forefront of that revolution.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
Cu = cost of under-supply<n>At the simplest level, the optimal stocking policy for nonreplenishable goods is to stock the quantity (Q*) that satisfies [Prob(D<Q*)] = (Cu)/(Cu+Co). For example, suppose a retailer can purchase a dress for $200 that it sells for $440. Suppose also that if the retailer stocks too many of these dresses, it can only sell the leftovers for $120 each. In this case, the cost of oversupply comes to $80 = $200 – $120 because the retailer loses that much on every leftover dress. Conversely, the retailer loses $240 = $440 – $200 whenever it stocks out of a dress that a customer would have purchased at full price. According to the model, the retailer should purchase the quantity Q* that will yield [Prob(D<Q*)] = 240/(240+80) = 240/320 = .75—that is, a 75 percent probability that demand for the dress will be less than the quantity purchased.<n>With this analysis completed, the retailer must next forecast demand for the dress at the SKU level. A sample demand forecast for the dress appears in Figure 6.4. The buyer should order 250 units, since there is a 75 percent probability that demand will be less than this. Note that this buyer would be ordering more than she expects to sell (the mean value of the distribution, 180 units). This makes sense, because the margins on these dresses are high relative to the cost of buying additional dresses and having to dispose of them below cost.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch6.txt
When most people think of apparel design, they see fashion designers and models on runways. Yet the vast majority of design in the apparel industry has little to do with the way clothing is created in the high-fashion world. Often apparel design and pattern-making are done by department stores, private-label offices, and small manufacturers in addition to major firms. The name designers generally create fashion directions and the next tier of designers fill out the new directions into many levels and for many items of apparel.3 Department stores also have designers at headquarters who prepare designs and patterns for their private-label collection.<n>Although many apparel manufacturers do have in-house designers, most of the work of garment design comes in adjusting previous -patterns or small elements of existing garments—say, the trim or the fabric—and is more a matter of technical creation than a flight of fancy. Consider the expansion of basic and fashion-basic garments in the U.S. market. For T-shirts, sweatpants, and different types of jeans, the design elements that change annually may only amount to a change of color, fit of the jeans, or the addition of a pocket to sweatpants.<n>Traditionally, a new apparel design was created by asking the designer/artist to make a watercolor sketch. If the fabric was to have a pattern, there might also be a close-up colored sketch of it. Many designs would be grouped together into a storyboard, which was then presented to managers for final decisions. Next the designs that passed this stage went through a technical design step in which details were added and patterns made. After this step, fabric might be cut and a sample made to see how it would look on a mannequin. If the new garment was a blouse, for example, the designer might wish to see how it looked with skirts planned for the collection. If the designer was not satisfied with the drape of the garment, the fit, or the pattern, he or she might go back to square one. Several iterations of these initial design steps could add weeks or months to the process before production began.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
Most often, an electrically driven vertical reciprocating knife is used to cut the fabric. The vertical knife oscillates less than three-quarters of an inch but can cut cloth plies a foot or more in thickness. The knife and motor are supported above the base plate by a frame. The frame also gives the cutter a place to grip the machine for hand-guided cutting. The base plate is a smooth cap with a slit to contain the moving end of the knife. The knives have built-in sharpeners that run a stone up and down the blade every few minutes. In such a “hand-cutting” operation, the operator guides the knife along the outlines on the paper marker fixed to the fabric lay. One hand holds the marker on the lay, the other guides the electric knife. When a pattern piece is cut from the lay, the cutter then makes the notch cuts indicated on the marker. These slits should be about one-eighth of an inch cut into the three-eighth-inch sewing margin around the pattern. The chances are high of making the slit too deep or forgetting it entirely. Computer-controlled cutting machines, on the other hand, do not forget.<n>Joseph Gerber solved the major problem in cutting—how to hold the cloth while the knife cuts through the material—by putting the entire lay on a vacuum table. The fabric lay with the marker on top is covered with a thin sheet of clear plastic. When the vacuum pump comes on, five pounds of force per square foot push down on the fabric. The thin plastic sheet effectively cuts off the flow of room air through the fabric. The vacuum holds the cloth firmly and compresses the thickness of the lay, typically by half.<n>Gerber’s automatic-cutting equipment holds the knife on a frame that spans the cutting table and moves back and forth along the table. The location of the knife anywhere on the table can be precisely controlled by a computer, allowing it to cut its way along the silhouette of the patterns. Finally, Gerber’s equipment enabled the knife to slice through all the cloth without hitting the top of the vacuum table, supporting the lay of cloth on a brush between the fabric and the inlets to the vacuum table. The stiff bristles of the brush were made of plastic with flat tops, similar in appearance to a flat-headed nail. The flat tops supported the fabric. The plastic bristles were stiff enough to support the fabric layer under the force of vacuum while remaining sufficiently flexible to deflect out of the path of the knife.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
There are two different approaches under way. The first modifies an existing apparel design in a few dimensions to improve its fit for an individual customer. Levi Strauss, which is currently offering custom-fit jeans for women in some stores, provides the best example of this kind of mass customization. Many women have a difficult time finding a pair of jeans that fits to their satisfaction. Buying jeans is based on both style and fit; for many people this means trying on several different brands and finally making compromises. Jeans-makers have tried to satisfy the majority by making many different styles and sizes, but for some customers there still are not enough choices.11 Fit for a given style involves at least four different measurements. Obviously, waist and hip measurements are important, but where the waist should be also matters and, once that is determined, there is inseam length.12<n>A customer for Levi’s custom jeans is asked to try on the style that comes closest to the fit she wants. The store sales associate then takes the four key measurements: waist, hips, where the waist should be, and inseam. These measurements, along with the style of jeans and the type of fabric, are sent to a sewing plant where they are cut, sewn, and then mailed to the customer. Levi’s uses proprietary software to make these modifications, but other software systems are commercially available for modifying standard patterns and producing a marker to guide fabric cutting.13<n>The actual making of custom jeans or any other item of custom apparel is slightly more complicated than making an equivalent item under standard production conditions. The pattern pieces for each individual pair of jeans must first be modified. Then a unique marker must be created that combines different orders using the same fabric. Under these conditions, a marker will not be as efficient as the standard production markers shown in Figures 8.1 and 8.2 (page 137) because the amount of cloth that can be saved for a single ply does not justify the time required to reach high levels of cloth utilization. Indeed, fabric-cutting costs are higher for custom clothing than for mass-produced items simply because just one item of apparel is cut at a time.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
As we have noted throughout, the actual sewing of a garment may take place far away from its design: the translation of that design into a pattern, and the making of a marker of that pattern, which is arranged on layers of fabric for cutting. Consequently, the assembly of that garment often involves sewing together pieces from prearranged bundles sent by the manufacturer. In the contemporary world of contractors, subcontractors, and complicated sourcing decisions, assembly is usually the step in the manufacturing process that is farmed out to lower-cost firms.<n>Yet just because many U.S. manufacturers rely on foreign contractors for a good portion of garment assembly, it does not mean sewing in a factory requires little or no skill. Only a very few sewing operations involve a machine that is fully automated, in which the operator’s job comes down to stacking parts at one end of the sewing system and re-threading the machines if a thread breaks. Today’s factory sewing machine is generally dedicated to a single operation and most likely will be fitted with specialized fixtures in the area of the stitch plate—to help guide the seaming a fixed distance from the fabric edge, for example, or fold the edge of the cloth under, or with other attachments that feed elastic tape and so on into the seaming operation as needed. More complicated sewing operations require the operator to guide differential stitching, with more fabric in each top stitch than in the bottom one. Regardless of which individual sewing operations are required, the operator must be trained and given practice time to achieve a quality product, at least at the standard production rates.<n>The time required for a new worker to achieve production standards, while maintaining quality, can range from days for the simplest operation to nearly a year for joining the sleeve to the body of a suit coat. A few sewing operations are so demanding that some operators are never able to achieve the minimum acceptable production rate for them. With different skill levels required for different operations, it is not surprising that piece rates vary with the difficulty of the operation. In this chapter, we will describe what actually goes on in today’s sewing room—the machines used, what operators do, the flow of operations—and how sourcing decisions for replenishable products may affect assembly operations in the future.4<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
The Lockstitch Machine<n>Almost all home machines are lockstitch machines. The top thread comes from a spool or cone of thread above the machine and goes through many thread guides, a thread tensioner, a take-up arm, and, finally, the needle. The bottom thread is wound on a bobbin, a small spool, that is below the needle and the sewing surface. To make a stitch, the needle with the top thread is plunged through the plies of fabric, and a loop of the top thread is formed below the surface of the stitch plate (often called a “throat plate”).5 The loop of top thread is passed over the bobbin and around its thread. The take-up arm then pulls up the top thread to set a stitch. The top and bottom threads are locked together by passing the loop of the top thread around the bobbin.<n>One part of the art of sewing comes in adjusting the thread tension.6 With a lockstitch machine, when the needle withdraws from the cloth and the take-up arm pulls the top thread tight, the stitch begins to be “locked” or set in place. If the tension on the top and bottom thread is too high, the seam puckers and the seam length becomes less than that of the cloth. If the tension is too low, the seam will be so loose one can see through it when holding up the joined pattern pieces. Indeed, a well-formed lockstitch is smooth and appears the same when viewed from either the top or bottom ply. Note that even if a sewing machine is properly adjusted for sewing a particular weight and color of fabric, it will generally need to be adjusted again if the fabric color changes because the mechanical properties of a given type of fabric can depend on the dye color used. The lighter the fabric weight, the more sensitive seam quality is to machine adjustments and thread tensions as well as to the ability of sewing operators to make necessary adjustments.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt

The lighter the fabric weight, the more sensitive seam quality is to machine adjustments and thread tensions as well as to the ability of sewing operators to make necessary adjustments.<n>In a factory setting, lockstitch machines are used for the decorative stitching that is necessary whenever the undersurface of a garment piece will be seen during normal wear, such as in the collar and cuffs of a dress shirt. The primary disadvantage of this kind of machine is that the bobbin must be small enough so that it can pass through the top thread loop, but it then quickly empties of thread. When this happens, sewing must be stopped and a newly loaded bobbin inserted to replace the empty one. Since the bobbin is reached by sliding back the stitch plate, if a bobbin runs out in the middle of an operation, it might be necessary to rip the seam out from the beginning and start over. Therefore, sewing operators generally keep track of the number of items sewn on a bobbin and stop before the thread runs out. If it were not for the limited thread capacity of the bobbin and the need for the operator to wind thread onto the bobbin, the lockstitch would be more widely used in factory assembly operations.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
Because the bottom thread does not have to be encircled by the top thread, the bottom thread can come from a large cone stored above the machine. A new cone of looper thread contains miles of thread and generally does not have to be replaced more frequently than a few times during a shift. The operator can glance up at the cones of both top and bottom threads and replace them before they run out in the middle of a seam. The disadvantage of this kind of machine is that it makes seams that are not as secure as the lockstitch; in addition, the appearance of the seam from the top and bottom of the fabric is different. If a stitch is skipped—the looper thread is not inserted or may not get caught in the loop of the top thread—then the resulting thread loop could pull the seam out if it were to catch on something. Factory inspectors look for such flaws, but they are hard to find because they end up on the inside of a garment.<n>Nevertheless, the advantages of the chain-stitch machine far outweigh its disadvantages. A chain-stitch seam is strong and can be produced more quickly than a lockstitch seam. Most of the long seams in factory-sewn apparel are made with a chain-stitch machine or with variations of it. The felled seam commonly used for the inseam of jeans comes from a two-needle chain-stitch machine. Such stitching generally outlasts the fabric of jeans, as one can see from looking at the holey knees of jeans worn by many teenagers.<n>Other Sewing Machines<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
In a typical apparel factory, a sewing operator is actually sewing only one-quarter of the time. The operator must first select the work to be done, put aside the tickets that indicate she performed the sewing appropriate for those bundles and should be paid at the specified rate for the job, open the appropriate bundles, and position the pieces to be joined on the sewing table in preparation for sewing.7<n>If the sewing machine is correctly threaded, the operator then lifts the presser foot—a device that comes down on either side of the needle to hold the cloth—and, if the needle is in the up position, inserts the fabric. Otherwise, the operator turns the machine wheel to get the needle in the up position, lowers the presser foot, sews the beginning of the seam, backstitches to lock the seam, grabs the two plies of cloth near where the seam will end, and guides the cloth through the sewing machine. Usually, she will backstitch at the seam end, then cut the thread. Some machines have an automatic thread-trimmer to do this step; if not, then the threads must be cut and the finished work put in an appropriate pile to be tied together when all the pieces of the bundle have been finished.8<n>Machine-tending, material placement, and off-loading operations are all considered part of a sewing operator’s job. Although none of these operations actually involves sewing, they do take time to complete and are taken into account when determining the piece rate and normal workload for an operation. If a new sewing table or a new sewing machine with programmable features is added at a particular workstation—that is, any device that reduces the time it takes to complete various tasks—then the allowable time and wage rate for that operation must be changed.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
Machine-tending, material placement, and off-loading operations are all considered part of a sewing operator’s job. Although none of these operations actually involves sewing, they do take time to complete and are taken into account when determining the piece rate and normal workload for an operation. If a new sewing table or a new sewing machine with programmable features is added at a particular workstation—that is, any device that reduces the time it takes to complete various tasks—then the allowable time and wage rate for that operation must be changed.<n>These issues aside, there is one other major task a sewing operator performs. She must make the pieces of the pattern fit together at the end of the sewing process. This is certainly not possible if there has been a big mistake in cutting, but it is never easy, even without serious cutting errors. If two plies of flat cloth of identical length are placed on top of each other and sewn together, then the ends of the two pieces will not line up without the intervention of a sewing operator. The two ends of a thirty-inch leg seam on a pair of jeans, for instance, might be a quarter of an inch out of alignment unless the operator takes control. During sewing, the feed-dog on the machine—a part that comes up through two slots in the stitch plate and engages the bottom ply of cloth—will pull the bottom ply under the presser foot and against the pull of the thread. The top ply of cloth is carried along by the bottom ply; hence, one ply is stretched more than the other.<n>This simple fact of sewing makes it very difficult to automate the process. In reality, the two seam lines to be joined are rarely exactly the same length. Cutting introduces differences from the top to the bottom of the layers of fabric. No matter how good spreaders and cutters are, preassembly operations are never perfect. The sewing operator must overcome all these prior minor variations, as well as the differences introduced by the sewing process, and make the joining seam come out even at the end. She accomplishes this magic by stretching the two plies differently. First, the plies are stretched to get the pattern notches in the two to align; then the ends are pulled together, causing them to align. The operator uses the elasticity of the cloth to overcome minor errors in cutting and prior sewing. Indeed, most trained sewing operators see this defect correction simply as part of their job.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
Work Flow in a Plant<n>The flow of operations through a typical men’s dress-shirt sewing factory is shown in Figure 9.1 (page 160). The subassemblies for the collars, backs, fronts, cuffs, and sleeves might be on one side of a center aisle down the factory floor and the major assembly steps on the other side. The factory manager needs to keep track of the flow of items through the plant to assure that the subassemblies, such as the sleeves, are ready to join the shirt. A given shirt must have a specified collar size and a given sleeve length. Clearly, the fabric, color, and style must also match. If the cut bundles are sent to the factory once a week, this manager might then put that week’s bundles into carts identified by a flag flying the color for that week. Note that the work in a shirt plant is generally grouped into production lots of 1,500 shirts if the progressive bundle system is used. Shirts are normally counted by the dozen, so a production lot comes to 125 dozen.<n>Each day, the manager looks over the factory floor to see if any carts with a particular flag color are falling behind the others of that group. Delays in product flow can result from machine problems, worker absence, or if priority is given to special orders. In some plants, the carts may contain up to a day’s worth of work. Although this may appear to be a crude way of keeping track of the work flow, it is simple and generally effective. Still, work almost never progresses in perfect lockstep through a factory. Finding the correct parts for a shirt can often involve a hunt through the plant. For example, a worker might accidentally leave a bundle of unfinished work in the cart when it goes back to be loaded again. Because a worker may have a day’s work in the carts in front of her, it is easy to see how individual bundles of parts can be misplaced—which, in turn, will hold up the assembly of some SKUs. Partially finished shirts and shirt subassemblies will then be in a number of places in the factory.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
Over the past three decades, external forces impinging on the family have transformed parents’ and, therefore, children’s lives. Overall, parents complain that they have less free time to spend with their children.1 Witness a 1995 survey of a large, representative sample of American workers, nearly 25 percent of whom expressed the feeling that the demands of their jobs left them with “no time for family.”2 Compounding their worries, employed parents must, out of necessity, turn over many hours of child rearing to other adults. Yet once their children are beyond their grasp, they are hardly o the hook! Conscientious parents face an added responsibility: monitoring their child’s whereabouts and activities, verifying from a distance that their youngster is physically safe, emotionally contented, and constructively engaged.<n>Although many societal conditions heighten parents’ struggle to rear psychologically healthy children, two are especially pernicious, aecting even parents who manage to escape the trials and tribulations of divorce, single parenthood, stepchildren, serious ﬁnancial worries, and other family stresses. The ﬁrst is the dire shortage of acceptable child-care options in the United States, the second is the parental dilemma of “never enough time.” In view of these diculties, it is little wonder that so many American parents express a sense of powerlessness and inadequacy when it comes to aecting their children’s development.<n>the problem of child care.  In 1970, 30 percent of mothers with pre-school children were in the labor force, a ﬁgure that increased more than twofold, to 62 percent, by 2000.3 An obvious solution to reconciling parents’ employment needs with young children’s rearing needs is to make high-quality, nonparental care, with characteristics known to promote healthy psychological development, widely available and aordable. In Australia and Western Europe, child care is nationally regulated and liberally funded to ensure that it conforms to standards veriﬁed by research to foster children’s learning, social competence, and emotional security.4<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
A close look at the research reveals that children who fared well experienced eective interaction over an extended period. In studies following children from infancy into childhood and adolescence, early brief episodes of parental stimulation and sensitivity did not result in more competent children.8 Instead, positive, supportive parenting that endured, even when it marked a change from an early period of parental retreat or negative interaction, was linked to favorable child development, including persistence in problem solving, high self-esteem, socially skilled behavior, closer friendships, and better peer relationships.9 In sum, high-quality involvement with children requires a certain quantity of time—actually, a great deal, as I’ll argue in this book.<n>In Angela and Tom’s case, sandwiching concentrated time with Victor and Jeannine between work and other obligations, which often took precedence over family rituals, meant that routines that signal parental caring and that are major sources of development went by the wayside. For example, family dinnertimes and storybook reading at bedtime became rare events. So did the sheer enjoyment that comes from relaxed parent–child play; a joint cooking, art, or construction project; and a conversation based on real listening and exchange of ideas. Because these experiences were so few and short-lived, Angela and Tom were deprived of valuable opportunities to observe their children closely and to become intimately familiar with their talents, shortcomings, preferences, styles of learning, and ways of coping with hardship—knowledge that is crucial for helping children develop into mature, competent individuals.<n>Furthermore, the “time bind” stiﬂes an essential child-rearing responsibility that I mentioned earlier and will return to again: monitoring children’s experiences while they are both within and beyond parents’ immediate reach. This includes frequently touching base with nonparental caregivers and teachers to ﬁnd out what’s happening at child care or in the classroom; looking in on sibling and peer interaction to make sure that it is positive and respectful; and controlling time spent watching TV and playing video games.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
According to Piaget, as the brain matures and children’s experiences expand, they move through a sequence of four cognitive stages, or reorganizations of thought: (1) sensorimotor, the stage of infancy, in which babies use their senses and movements to explore the world; (2) preoperational, the stage of early childhood, in which preschoolers use symbols, especially language and make-believe play, to represent their earlier sensorimotor discoveries, but thinking lacks the logic of older children; (3) concrete operational, in which cognition is well organized and logical but limited to coordinating only two or three variables when solving problems; and (4) formal operational, the stage of adolescence, which opens up the capacity for abstraction, permitting young people to coordinate an increasing number of variables and to imagine all possible outcomes in a problem, not just the most obvious.30<n>In contrast to the behaviorist emphasis on adult tutoring, Piaget believed that since development follows a natural, internally controlled stage sequence, what comes from within the child is paramount in guiding cognitive change. The environment, including the social environment, is available for children to interact with as they make sense of their experiences, but it does not determine the evolution of the child’s mind. Instead, Piaget argued that children are in charge of changes in their own thinking and that biological readiness enables them to capitalize on a wider array of environmental opportunities, both physical and social, in revising inadequate, incorrect mental structures and creating new ones.<n>Piaget’s contribution to the ﬁeld of child development is enormous. He inspired more research on children’s thinking than any other single theorist. Especially important, Piaget convinced the academic community—as well as many parents and teachers—that children are active contributors to their own development, have their own ways of understanding the world, and must be developmentally ready if teaching is to be successful.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
Experts of Gesell’s time complained that he went too far in downplaying the role of parents. His advice was soon overshadowed by Benjamin Spock’s standby, Baby and Child Care, published in 1946 and selling millions of copies over seven editions, the most recent appearing in 1998.39 Providing answers to virtually any question about child rearing that might occur to a parent, from physical care to emotional, disciplinary, and educational issues, Spock seemed, on many fronts, to lean toward parental ﬁrmness and away from children’s rule-of-the-roost. A closer look, however, indicates that even Spock felt torn between the embattled forces of adult and child control. He tried to grant legitimacy to both poles, commenting that perhaps it’s not what you do but how you do it:<n>A strictness that comes from harsh feelings or a permissiveness that is timid or vacillating can each lead to poor results. The real issue is what spirit the parent puts into managing the child and what attitude is engendered in the child as a result.40<n>Above all, Spock admonished parents to trust themselves, to have the courage of their convictions. Yet many parents “at sea”—in search of a sound child-rearing ideology within the morass of clashing dictates—undoubtedly found Spock’s directive hard to follow.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
Martha Bronson’s The Right Stuff for Children Birth to 813 is as an excellent resource for selecting play materials that provide children of varying ages with both pleasure and an appropriate challenge. On pages 138 to 141 of Chapter 4, I provided an overview of play-material suggestions for stimulating make-believe and game play in children between 2 and 8 years of age. In Bronson’s book, you’ll ﬁnd additional recommendations, organized into four broad play-activity categories: social and fantasy play; exploration and cognitive mastery; music, art, and movement; and gross motor play.<n>Children’s rooms and play spaces need not be ﬁlled with every toy imaginable. A modest number of toys is sufficient. Children who have too much typically care little for what they have. When given a chance to acquire something new, they usually don’t react with much excitement or selectivity. For materially indulged children, new toys are such a common event that a complacent attitude sets in. The child comes to think, if I don’t like what I just got, I can always discard it for something else. A bedroom or playroom heaped high with a jumble of toys, many broken and mistreated, also teaches children that possessions need not be cared for and respected.<n>Parents often assume that the play materials children choose are the ones that are best for their development. To some degree, this assumption makes sense: If a toy isn’t appealing to the child, the child isn’t going to spend time with it. So it’s important to provide children with a variety of play materials responsive to their interests.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
It’s easy to tell preschool and young school-age children too much about pregnancy and childbirth—more than they are capable of understanding. The best approach is to respond to their questions with simple, direct answers. The younger the preschooler, the less likely he or she is to notice the pregnant mother’s growing tummy and to be interested in how the baby got in there. Such questions as, “Where do babies come from?” “Where did I come from?” and “How does a baby get born?” rarely occur before age 5.<n>When children do ask these questions, parents vary widely in how much information they are comfortable in providing. Up to age 8 or 9, most children are satisﬁed with such general explanations as it “starts as a little seed inside the mother, which grows into a baby,” “grows in a special space in the mother’s tummy called a uterus,” and “when the baby’s ready to be born, the mother’s uterus squeezes and squeezes, and the baby comes out.” Some parents show their child books with pictures of fetuses, identifying those that are about the same age as the forthcoming sibling and discussing the baby’s development as it progresses. There’s no evidence that this is in any way harmful or that it’s necessary during early childhood; rather, it’s a matter of parental choice.<n>Eight- to 9-year-olds are ready for more detailed knowledge about how babies are conceived and grow, as children of this age are getting closer to puberty. A variety of well-written and illustrated books are available to help parents discuss love between partners, conception, birth, and rearing of children. Parents need to select carefully, making sure they agree with the book’s values. Two books that I like are How Babies Are Made, by Andrew Audrey and Steven Schep,14 and Where Did I Come From? by Peter Mayle.15 How I Was Adopted, by Joanna Cole,16 is an excellent starting point for discussion with preschool and young school-age children who are adopted.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
Barbacoa de Cabeza (Barbecued Beef Head)<n>Barbacoa refers to a method of cooking meat, in a pit of hot wood coals. The English word barbecue comes from barbacoa. Barbacoa de cabeza is the cooking of a beef head in this manner. It is an old custom and cultural event that in parts of south Texas occurs every weekend, with the barbacoa eaten on Sunday mornings. In other parts of the Southwest this style of cooking is reserved for special events such as weddings, funerals, and large family gatherings. According to the Diccionario de Mejicanismos (Dictionary of Mexicanisms), barbacoa is “carne asada en un hoyo que se abre en tierra, y se calienta como los hornos” (grilled meat cooked in a hole in the ground heated like an oven). Cooking the beef head with this method means all the parts can be eaten, such as the brains, eyes, tongue, lips, literally everything. Although originally a discarded part of the cow, now it is considered a delicacy and is prepared and sold in many neighborhood stores and restaurants along the Rio Grande border region. Today the term barbacoa is used only to mean the cooking of meat in a pit, also called pit cooking.<n>References Montano 1992; Peyton 1994<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
Bato (Dude)<n>Bato is a word centuries old that can be translated as “guy” or “dude.” Most recently it has been spelled vato, transposing the v for the b. In Chicano communities, in-group chatter, and published literature one frequently comes across the expression bato loco, meaning a “crazy guy,” a “cool dude,” or a “wise guy.” Bato was a word incorporated into the pachuco jargon of the 1940s, and it is still very much a part of Chicano vocabulary today. The bato loco, or vato loco, is the descendent of the pachuco and a close relation of today’s cholo (urban youth). The bato is often mentioned in connection with his barrio, as in el vato loco del Hoyo Mara.<n>The bato loco is tantamount to an archetype in Chicano culture; he is that crazy guy who isn’t afraid of life. He may be a gang member, a drug user, or just an entertaining street person. He could also be fully immersed in la vida loca as described by Luis Rodriguez in his book, Always Running, and by Oscar Zeta Acosta in The Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo. In the novel The Road to Tamazunchale, Ron Arias creates a streetwise character, a bato named Mario, who acts as a sidekick to the main character, Fausto. The two wander through a mythical Los Angeles in search of “the song of life.” For the contemporary Chicano male, el bato loco is not only a symbol of ethnic identity but also an icon of the urban coming-of-age experience itself.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
Braceros (Laborers)<n>Mexican workers recruited from Mexico under the Emergency Farm Labor Program known as the Bracero Program, which was in effect from 1942 to 1964. The word bracero comes from the Spanish word brazo (arm), which is used, as English uses “hand,” to mean “laborer.” In the same way bracero commonly means a man who works with his hands, a laborer, and is used when speaking of all farm and agricultural workers. There was a shortage of farm laborers during World War II, and this program offered an answer to that problem, although some braceros also worked on the railroad. Until only recently bracero was applied to any Mexican farmworker, and is often used interchangeably with words like “wetback” or “greaser.” The number of workers brought from Mexico ranged from a low of 4,180 in 1942 to a high of 62,091 in 1944. It is estimated that by 1947 nearly 220,000 braceros had worked in the United States under this program. It continued even after the war, and between 1955 and 1959 over 480,000 braceros were still working in the United States. Some have compared the Bracero Program with legalized slavery, and the impact on the perception of the Mexican farmworker by American agribusiness has been to foster contempt and disdain. Many braceros chose not to return to Mexico when their contracts ended and -instead stayed and hid from la migra, the feared Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).<n>Many Chicanos of the Southwest and Midwest are descendants of braceros who came to the United States and stayed, never returning to Mexico. The bracero experience has been written about in novels and depicted in numerous movies, and although the image presented is often a negative one, like other Chicano folk heroes the bracero has become an archetype of the culture. He is in the company of the historical mestizo character of Yo soy Joaquín, the revolutionary figure of Joaquín Murrieta, the mythical pachuco, the stately learned persona of Dr. Paredes, the gentle leadership of César Chávez; the bracero is the universally exploited farmworker, the campesino of the world. Many corridos (ballads) describe the experience of coming to work in the agricultural fields of the Midwest and the Southwest. Maria Herrera-Sobek -describes the prototype of the bracero, as represented in countless corridos, in her book The Bracero Experience. In Mexico the experience was written about from the perspective of those who returned, as in such books as Aventuras de un Bracero, by Jesus Amaya Topete, published in 1949 and reprinted several times, and in the United States the novel Macho! by Edmund Villaseñor, published in 1973.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
Caló (Spanish Slang)<n>Caló comes from the gypsy word zincaló, which is one of the idioms of the Spanish gypsies. It is a very old argot influenced by many languages, including French, English, Italian, Greek, and Hebrew, and was spoken by the gypsies of Spain. It was brought to New Spain by the Spanish conquistadores, where it continued to be identified as the language of the poor, the uneducated, and also the criminal class. Caló became the dialect of the underworld of Mexico City and migrated into the Southwest, as some believe, through the city of El Paso.<n>Published studies of the speech of the Chicano investigate the diverse communication modes by examining the language that reflects the cultural experiences of the various subcultures of Mexican and Chicano communities. Some of these idioms are the pachuco dialect, Chicano Spanish, New Mexico colonial Spanish, south Texas vocabulary, caló, and the argot of the tirilones of El Paso. The pachuco dialect has been especially influenced by caló; it was and still is primarily a male speech and if used by women they were considered to be street women or girlfriends of gang members. Today, however, many words from caló are fully integrated into the standard -vocabulary of Chicano Spanish, and writers incorporate it into poetry, short stories, and novels. What makes caló and its appropriation into Chicano Spanish distinct is its use by working-class Chicanos and Mexicanos. It is a shared language across the Mexican-U.S. border, equally used on both sides.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chC.txt
Mandas (Promises)<n>The Spanish dictionary definition of manda is a “proposal” or an “offer.” It comes from the verb mandar, meaning “to order” or “to command,” and the phrase mandar hacer means “to have made” or “to command to be made.” In folk religious practices a manda is interpreted as a promise or contract made with a saint, the Virgin Mary, or God. The contract is not a legal commitment nor made with the approval of a priest or the Catholic Church. It is purely a personal promise made to fulfill or complete a journey, a devotional act, or to recite a certain number of prayers. This promise is in exchange for the curing of an illness or for a solution to a problem. The manda may involve the placing of a milagro (symbol of a miracle) at the shrine of a saint, La Virgen de Guadalupe cathedral in Mexico City for example, or the lighting of candles at the local church. Although the fulfillment of the manda in itself may not be difficult, its completion often involves some sacrifice, and this aspect is also considered part of the manda. Lighting daily candles could be a financial strain, and a pilgrimage may take several years to complete, yet neither is ever forgotten, and a manda is taken more seriously than a legal written contract. There may be fear of retribution from a saint if the manda is not fulfilled, and sometimes individuals actually suffer this retribution. If a woman makes a manda asking for a cure to her child’s illness and the child is cured but she does not complete the manda, the child may become ill again. The woman will believe the second illness was caused because she did not complete her manda. A manda may be completed after the request is fulfilled in thanksgiving, or it may be fulfilled before the petition is answered, with the assumption that it will be answered. Mandas are very private and often only very close family members are aware that a person has made one.<n>References Cantú 1991a; Durand and Massey 1995; Egan 1991; Oktavec 1995<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
In the last thirty years Mariachi festivals have become very popular throughout the Southwest. They have been held in San Antonio, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; San Jose, California; and even Universal Studios in Hollywood originated a festival in 1985. Los Angeles is home to the largest assemblage of Mariachi musicians in the United States.<n>Theories about the origin of the word Mariachi are interesting. There is the idea that it evolved from María, the name of the mother of Jesus Christ. Another idea is that it comes from the French word for marriage. But it is likely that the etymology of the word is of an indigenous nature. Mariachi groups originated in the region of Jalisco, even before it was named as a state, a region greatly influenced by the Coca people, and in fact the Nahuatl word for contemporary indigenous performers is mariachitos.<n>References Harpole 1990; Loza 1985, 1993; Najera-Ramirez 1994; Narváez 1978; Pearlman 1988; Rafael 1983<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
Pachucos (-as) (1940s Urban Youth)<n>A name adopted by Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals to designate those who make up a fascinating urban subculture, detached from U.S. culture and from Mexican American urban life also. The first appearance of pachucos was in the El Paso–Juárez area during the 1920s and early 1930s. It is thought the word pachuco was a colloquial way of referring to El Paso. A person from El Paso was referred to as del pachuco. Sometimes a person considered a pachuco was called a chuco. Haldeen Braddy discusses the origin of the word pachuco, providing several theories. One is that the pachucos of the 1930s came from the city of Pachuca in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. He also pre-sents the definition from the Diccionario General de Americanismos, stating that pachuca is a five-card poker hand in which all the cards are of different suits, or in other words, a poker hand with no value, a losing hand. Braddy believes this well describes the pachucos of El Paso (1971). The other theory is that pachuco comes from the Nahuatl word pachtli, which refers to a grass like hay that grows parasitically on trees.<n>Pachucos were identifiable by their clothing, hairstyles, and a distinct language with its own vocabulary. The men wore “zoot suits,” that is, pegged pants, long coats with padded shoulders, and pancake hats. Their hair was worn long and slicked back with a ducktail effect. Some also wore a long chain hanging from their pants, well displayed and connected to a belt. Pachucas were the girlfriends of the pachucos, but they also had a dress style all their own. They wore short, very tight skirts, with their hair high and long. Makeup was heavy, especially around the eyes. Supposedly they were very streetwise and liked to hang out with their pachuco boyfriends.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt
The pachuco was disdained in the U.S. by both the Mexican American and Anglo communities, and likewise in Mexico by the media and the intellectuals. Octavio Paz, much quoted, disparagingly discusses the phenomenon of the pachuco in his book The Labyrinth of Solitude, published in English in 1961. Although almost any urban Chicano who was young in the 1940s was affected by the style and language of the pachuco, the stereotypic pachuco was often associated with violence and deviancy. The zoot-suit riots of 1943 are held up as the epitome of the pachuco experience, totally disregarding previous and later experiences. According to Alfredo Mirandé, “The pachuco has been an especially visible symbol of cultural autonomy and resistance. His distinctive dress, demeanor, mannerism, and language not only express his manhood but set him off culturally from the dominant society. To be a chuco is to be proud, dignified, and to uphold one’s personal integrity as well as the honor and integrity of the group. It is at once an affirmation of one’s manhood and one’s culture” (1985, 179–180). The pachuco is the precursor to the bato loco, the cholo, and the low rider of more contemporary times.<n>The pachuca was the counterpart of the pachuco of the 1940s but also the home-girl archetype that comes together in the young Chicana growing up in an urban ghettoized environment. During the 1940s, pachucas were the girlfriends of or those who hung around with pachucos. They developed their own style of dress, wearing very tight short skirts and sweaters and doing their hair in a pompadour style. Their behavior was loud and brash: they smoked cigarettes in public, wore lots of eye makeup, and supposedly were quick to fight. Pachucas knew the vernacular of the times, speaking pachuco and scandalizing their families. They were not necessarily gang members, but they can be considered the precursors of present-day cholas.<n>See also Caló; Cholos; Low Rider; Pocho; Tin Tan; Zoot Suit<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt
Pichilingis (Elves)<n>Elves or leprechauns that Anthony John Campos refers to as little people, pichilingis are goblins who perform mischievous pranks. Santamaria’s Diccionario de Mejicanismos’ definition for pichilingo is chiquito, muchachito, and niño pequeño, meaning “very small” and “little child.” The word piciligue, which comes from the Aztec, has the meaning of “to become small that which was thick or large.” Another closely related word also found in Santamaria is pichilingui, which is a common word for pato silvestre (wild duck), which is found in lakes in the interior of Mexico. Pichilingis are similar to duendes (goblins) and are possibly the indigenous version of a duende, and have only been found in the folklore literature of New Mexico. Duendes are very common in Chicano folktales, and many people still believe in them. They are often invisible yet their presence is felt because of the annoying tricks and antics they concoct.<n>See also Chanes; Duendes<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt
A tradition marking the beginning of the Christmas season with the dramatization of the search for lodging in Bethlehem by Joseph and Mary. It always includes a procession with singing and music and starts nine days before Christmas. The story, in the form of a novena (Catholic nine-days devotion), is based on the gospel of St. Luke. For nine consecutive nights before Christmas Eve, la Noche Buena (the good night), los peregrinos (the pilgrims) representing Joseph and Mary visit a different home each night, reenacting the search for an inn by Joseph and Mary. Los mesoneros, those who portray the innkeepers, keep refusing them lodging. Los peregrinos form a procession, and children and angels hand-carry the small figures of the Holy Family. When they arrive at a home they ask for shelter and sing carols. Las Posadas occurs from December 16 through December 24. Nine different homes are opened to the pilgrims and food and drink are offered after the peregrinos have been denied lodging. Most homes will have a nativity scene, a nacimiento, set up for the prayers and singers. An important tradition of these festivities is the piñata that is brought out and broken by the children. There is evidence that piñatas originated from this Christmas celebration.<n>Posadas are still held today in many Mexican communities in the United States. Some are organized by church groups, but recently others have been organized for commercial purposes by city entities. The reenactment of Las Posadas is an ancient tradition that can be traced back to the early conquest in Mexico and to the christianization of the Aztecs by the Augustine priests. They originated in the small village of San Augustin Acolman located near the pyramids in Teotihuacán. The Aztecs celebrated the birth of their god Huitzilopochtli for one night, and celebrations were held all of the following day in every home. This occurred about the same time of the year that the Catholic Church celebrated the birth of Christ. The Augustine priests saw the similarity between these Aztec celebrations and the Christmas festivities and chose this opportunity to teach the new religion to the Aztecs. While the Aztecs were celebrating the birth of Huitzilopochtli, the priests reenacted the pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph. The nine nightly journeys symbolize the nine months of pregnancy for Mary. These Christmas Masses, as they were called, were celebrated in the convents and churches, but eventually were moved to the haciendas, farms, and ranches, and finally to the neighborhoods. The celebrations ended with firecrackers and the breaking of a piñata. Today many cities in the Southwest reenact this pilgrimage for one night with a procession winding through city streets. In Monterey, California, the whole city comes out for Las Posadas, and in San Antonio, Texas, a posada is held during the Fiesta de las Luminarias (Festival of the Bonfires) that includes a procession on the Paso del Rio (river pass).<n>See also Nacimiento; Piñata<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt
Quinceañera (Fifteenth Birthday Party)<n>A coming-of-age celebration and ceremony for a young girl on her fifteenth birthday. The word Quinceañera comes from the Spanish word quince, meaning “fifteen” and añera, which together mean “the fifteen-year-old.” This celebration marks the beginning of adulthood for a young woman. It is a custom throughout Latin America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and in many areas of the United States to distinguish this birthday with a special observance. It is -assumed the custom has origins in pre-Columbian cultures, as a coming-of-age ritual for young women. In his Historia de Nueva España, Bernardino de Sahagún narrates that it was traditional for the parents of a young Aztec maiden to formally acknowledge her passage into womanhood. “Advice of an Aztec Mother to Her Daughter” is reprinted in William H. Prescott’s The Conquest of Mexico.<n>Communities in Texas have formally observed Quinceañera birthdays for many generations, whereas such celebrations are not as common in California and other parts of the Southwest. Traditionally this ceremony serves as a coming-out party to indicate that a girl has reached womanhood and is ready for marriage. In the United States this is no longer the case, but the celebration does symbolize the transition from childhood to womanhood. In some celebrations a doll called la muñeca de los recuerdos (the doll of memories) or la última muñeca (the last doll) is given to the celebrant as a symbol of the childhood she is leaving behind. Some people see it as the last vestiges of childhood and la última muñeca as the last doll she will ever receive.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chQ.txt
Ranchera (Country Song)<n>It is accepted that the word ranchera refers to a type of Mexican song, although sometimes it is an adjective that describes a character or a type of person. Ranchera comes from the word rancho, meaning a “cattle ranch, farm, or rural settlement.” A poor unsophisticated person may be called a ranchero or ranchera, implying he or she is from the countryside, the sticks, and a hick. In the context of Mexican folk music la canción ranchera is a love song, sung by the common folk, the peasants of the rural countryside. After the Mexican Revolution rancheras became more agreeable to the upper classes because of the movement toward a Mexican identity and nationalism and a rejection of European cultural values. The modern canción ranchera was made popular in Mexico City in the early 1950s by the songwriter José Alfredo Jimenez. The poetic structure of the ranchera is brief and simple, yet emotionally it is very intense. According to Rubén Campos as quoted by Gradante, “it is a moan and a sigh . . . , the briefest form of composition and, as such, requires a greater intensity of expression than any other compositional form. It must say precisely what it means” (1983, 105). The themes of rancheras are love and unrequited love, but from the point of view of the ordinary common man. Rancheras express the poetry of the masses. The famous ranchera singer Amalia Mendoza states, “the canción ranchera expresses the sensibility of the masses and reaches them: thus, its popularity. . . . One might say that the canción ranchera reflects the personality of the masses because it expresses something vital that we all have in common” (Gradante 1983, 105).<n>The ranchera originated in Mexico but is very popular in the United States among Mexicans and Chicanos. José Alfredo Jimenez wrote over 500 songs, many becoming classics that continue to be sung today by younger artists, that have a universal sentiment that speaks to the hearts of Chicanos. Because of the style of these romantic songs, sung to Mariachi music and sung in Spanish, untranslatable rancheras express the epitome of Mexicanness. The musical poetics arouse emotional sentiments about lost loves, nostalgia, and by extension about being Mexican. Songs such as “Ella” (Her), “Camino de Guanajuato” (Road to Guanajuato), “La Vida no Vale Nada” (Life Has No Value), and “Llego Borracho el Borracho” (The Drunk Arrived Drunk) all elicit memories of fathers, grandfathers, and stories of Mexico. Many are drinking songs, frequently shown in movies being sung in cantinas (bars), but they are also dancing songs, so they are played at celebrations and family gatherings. Although rancheras are intensely male centered, there are several female singers who became famous singing rancheras, such as Lola Beltran, Lucha Villa, and Amalia Mendoza. The performance of rancheras is always dramatic and emotional, whether performed by men or women, and the audience can always empathize with the situations depicted in the verses. The life experiences portrayed in the songs of José Alfredo Jimenez, who came from a poverty-stricken background himself, are about the struggles of Everyman, the need for social acceptance, personal happiness, and some type of financial security. These are concerns that the average Mexicano and Chicano can identify with. Although most rancheras speak of love, other life situations found in the songs deal with fortune, destiny, and life’s choices. In “Camino de Guanajuato,” these existential words open the song:<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chR.txt
La Vieja Inés y Los Listones (The Old Mother Game)<n>A very old game played by little girls that is known by various names. It is called Los Colores (the colors), Los Listones (the ribbons), and Tan Tan. The main players are la mamá and “Saint Inez,” who may also be called La Vieja Inés (Old Lady Inés) or La Virgen Inés (Old Maid Inés). All of the other players are given a color by the mamá: red, yellow, green, blue, or they may choose their own color. La Vieja Inés comes and pretends to knock on the door, Tan, tan. The mother asks, “Quién es?” (Who is it?) and the answer is “La Vieja Inés.” The mother asks, “Que quieres?” (What do you want?). “Quiero colores” is the answer. “Que color quieres?” (What color do you want?) “Quiero verde” (I want green), or any color is mentioned. The little girl whose color is mentioned runs away and La Vieja Inés tries to catch her before she reaches a spot designated as home base. The game goes on until all of the colors have been chosen and all of the girls are caught. In some versions the girls carry ribbons, each of a different color. Scholars who have analyzed the game point to the socialization of gender roles for little girls, and the game serves as a lesson in the inevitable eventual separation from the safety of home. This was one of the games collected by the Federal Writers’ Program in New Mexico during the 1930s. Although there were many games played by Hispano and Mexican children, this one appears to be one with a long historical tradition.<n>Jose Limón has written about a version found in Texas. It is an ancient game that can be traced to medieval Spain, to a place called Zafra. In the version from Zafra two teams are involved, one representing evil, the other goodness. One team is led by the devil, el demonio, and the other by an angel, ángel de la guarda (angel of the guard). Each player is named a color, and the two leaders, the devil and the angel, try to gain the most players. In this version it is a battle between good and evil to see who can win the most souls.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chV.txt
La Virgen de Guadalupe<n>Also commonly known as Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, she is the Virgin Mary who appeared to Juan Diego, a Mexican Christian Indian, on December 9, 1531. Historical documents verify the story of her apparitions. She identified herself as the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, and speaking in Nahuatl, she asked Juan Diego to go to the Spanish bishop and ask that a temple be built there where she appeared, the mount of Tepeyac. To Juan Diego she was a beautiful woman who spoke his language, so after much difficulty he sought to speak to the bishop, but his story was not heard, and he was asked to return another day. The beautiful woman appeared to Juan Diego a second time, and he was asked to seek the bishop’s audience again. On the second try Juan Diego saw the bishop, his story was heard and questioned, but was not believed. The bishop wanted a sign from the Great Lady so that he would know it was really she who was sending Juan Diego. Diego intended to go back to Tepeyac and inform the beautiful woman, but when he returned home he found that his uncle Juan Bernardino was extremely ill. The next morning, on December 12, as he walked to Tlatelolco to call a priest to come to his uncle’s side, the beautiful woman came to him a third time asking what was wrong. Diego told her of his sick uncle and of the request from the bishop. She told him his uncle was now well and would not die and sent him to the top of a hill to cut fresh flowers that he was to take to the bishop as proof of her existence. Diego followed her instructions and at the top of the hill he found beautiful roses of Castile, still covered with dew. He cut them and The Lady, the Mother of God, arranged them in his tilma (cloak) and sent him to the bishop, with the proof requested. When Diego unfolded his tilma in front of the bishop, the roses fell to the floor, and there on the tilma was an image of the Virgin Mary. Now the Spanish bishop believed, and as the beautiful woman requested, a church was built right on the mount of Tepeyac. The tilma with the image of the Virgin Mary still hangs in the temple called Guadalupe. The name that the beautiful Lady gave herself was Tlecuauhtlacupeuh, but to the Spaniards it sounded like Guadalupe, which they instantly recognized as “Our Lady of Guadalupe” from Estremadura, Spain. But the Aztecs understood that in the Nahuatl language the name Tlecuauhtlacupeuh meant “la que viene volando de la luz como el águila de fuego” (she who comes flying from the region of light like an eagle of fire).<n>Tonantzin was an Aztec goddess, literally called Our Holy Mother, also known as Tonan. Guadalupe appeared at what was once the temple of Tonantzin at the mount of Tepeyac. Even today in Mexico, La Virgen María is often called Tonantzin. The acceptance of La Virgen de Guadalupe by the indigenous population of Mexico was the beginning of Mexican Christianity and the conversion of the Aztecs to Catholicism. Guadalupe became the symbol of Indian Catholicism, different from the European Catholicism of the Spaniards. As the Aztecs adapted the Catholic religion to their indigenous beliefs, they created a religion that met their own needs and own way of life. She was declared the “Patroness of the Mexican Nation” in 1737, and in 1754 Pope Benedict XIV canonized Guadalupe as an official saint. She was crowned “Queen of Mexico” in 1895, showing how strong a symbol of Mexican nationalism she had become. Today she continues as the country’s strongest symbol of Mexican identity. The cathedral built in her honor can no longer be used because of structural damage, but a new one was built in the early 1970s. Masses are held every hour of the day and the church is constantly filled to capacity.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chV.txt
A triadic relationship between two people and the government represents an entirely new kind of constitutional order. A dyadic focus takes the government to be the enemy. The triadic orientation accepts the government as a partner in conquering evil. The dyadic picture assumes that the desired form of liberty exists in a state of nature and it treats the transition to government as a threat to liberty. The triadic conception recognizes the evil of domination inherent in a state of nature and treats government not only as necessary to rid us of that evil but as a welcome partner in the effort to build a civilized society.<n>This difference in the attitude toward government parallels a different understanding of freedom and how it comes into being. The freedom celebrated by the Bill of Rights resembles an island of solitude, a retreat from society. Its ideal is the individual in the state of nature, intimated by Henry David Thoreau’s retreat to Walden Pond.4 The individual stands alone, fearful that a far-off agent called government will aggress against him and limit his freedom. But the liberty that comes to the fore in the intended postbellum constitutional order and under the Secret Constitution requires the intervention of government. Liberty is born in the state’s assertion of responsibility to oversee and prevent relationships of oppression. The relationship between rights and freedom is thus turned on its head. Those who identify with the Bill of Rights and the mentality of 1791 think of both rights and freedom as islands of autonomy protected by the walls of the law against the threat of government. The view that comes to the fore in the Secret Constitution recognizes that freedom as well as rights depend on the proper interaction with government. Government is not the enemy of freedom but rather the mechanism by which freedom is secured in a society that tends toward domination and oppression.<n>The assertion of a triadic conception of government brought us into line with the middle European conception of freedom as the privilege that arises from living in a matrix of protective state regulations. It is not nature but the law that makes us free. Freedom is realized not by the state’s absence but from the construction of a network of laws that liberate the individual from the oppression that would otherwise occur. Compulsory temperance and drug laws generate freedom for those who are able to stay clean. Prohibitions against sexual self-degradation and peep shows strengthen the inner freedom of our human selves.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt
The metaphor of redemption should not pass our lips lightly. In its original meaning, it has legal connotations; something on loan gets returned to its owner. The older Jewish law of homicide relied on the metaphor of the Goel haDam, “the redeemer of blood” to refer to the victim’s next-of-kin who, under certain circumstances, could pursue the murderer and kill him. David Daube has interpreted this practice against the background assumption that at the time of a natural death, the life force—symbolized by blood—always returns to God.1 If the death occurs at the hand of another, the manslayer unnaturally acquires control over the victim’s “blood.” The Goel haDam, the redeemer-of-blood, executes the manslayer in order to release the victim’s blood, thus enabling it to return to its divine source. The notion that our life force belongs to God accounts for the views of virtually all secular liberal systems that no one can validly consent to his or her own killing at the hand of another.<n>It is tempting to extend this idea and to think of all humanity as enjoying a temporary privilege of life on earth. God somehow will redeem all of us at the end of history. In fact, the Jewish view, as it has evolved and matured, seems to have avoided this universalization of the idea that individual life stems from God. As the idea developed, the agent of redemption would be the Messiah, who would bring a reign of peace and harmony to life on earth. The redemption occurs in life as we know it. Orthodox Jewish culture takes the observance of God’s commandments, living under the rule of revealed law as interpreted by the rabbis, as the way to hasten the Messiah’s reign of harmony and order. The law, then, becomes the path toward redemption. Until the Prince of Peace comes to “fulfill the law,” or until the Apocalypse at the end of days, the secular law of the nation is the only means we have to work toward the perfection of life on earth.<n>The place of “blood” in the religious tradition of redemption proves to be subtle and problematic. There are some strains in the Jewish tradition that link the letting of blood with returning the soul to God. The “redeemer of blood” reminds us of that connection, as does the popular view that the founding of Israel stood in some kind of organic relationship with the Holocaust. The connection between blood and salvation becomes much stronger, however, in the Christian interpretation of its Jewish legacy. The theme of blood spilling from the body becomes powerful in the crucifixion and reaches its apotheosis in the faith that a great battle, an Apocalypse, must precede the Second Coming of the Messiah. The spilling of blood in a great battle is understood instinctively as the suffering that must precede redemption. As John Brown was led to the gallows on the eve of the Civil War, having unsuccessfully sought to stimulate a slave revolt, he handed one of his guards a note, “I John Brown am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood.”2<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt
These seven propositions summarize the enduring content of the Reconstruction Amendments.13 The key provisions of these amendments define political membership, articulate basic rights, and provide an ambit of legislative competence. So reformed, the American system of government would be able to protect individual rights as well as promote the equality of all persons who survived the war. Of course, we must assume a set of institutions—a Congress, an Executive, and a Judiciary—that will continue to function according to the terms of their initial creation.<n>Still, there is something missing in this filtering off of the three Reconstruction Amendments and calling them a separate constitution. The missing factor is the consciousness of setting forth a new framework of government, a structure based on values fundamentally different from those that went before. To find that consciousness, we need to turn, I wish to argue, to the critical message of the Civil War, the address that would generate a new normative world in which to make sense of the epic war that consumed America from the firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox. The new Nomos, the new framework of values that necessitated a new constitution, comes forth in one of the great prayers of the American civil religion, the Gettysburg Address. It is worth recalling some of the enduring phrases of this civil prayer, the incantations that reverberated in American consciousness:<n>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation. . . .<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt
The historical retreat to the Declaration of Independence left Lincoln with a major paradox. He claims to be speaking as president, and his office owed its existence to Article II of the Constitution of 1787. Yet, he thought himself back prior to the Philadelphia convention and the creation of the presidency. He pulled the rug of legitimacy out from under his own office. To be able to advocate the principle that all men are created equal, that a nation was born committed to this principle, he had to speak from a time prior to the creation of the government for which the Union troops died.<n>The precursor to this unusual mode of dating comes in an unexpected place—in the final paragraph of the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863:<n>Done at the City of Washington, this first day of<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt
Garry Wills makes much of the Greek influence in shaping Lincoln’s style at Gettysburg.6 But of the biblical influence on the Gettysburg Address, Wills has almost nothing to say. This is a rather curious twist in seeking to understand the president whose thinking and rhetoric were probably more influenced by the biblical idiom than the writings of any other president. Lincoln’s second inaugural address is replete with references to the Bible, including, notably, the latter part of Psalm 19, 10: “The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.” Lincoln saw the entire Civil War as a righteous judgment of the Divine. It is almost inconceivable that he would seek to formulate a framework for understanding the war’s place in American history without relying on biblical imagery.<n>Of all the biblical themes that shaped Lincoln’s thinking, the Hebrews’ Exodus from Egypt was the most compelling. In a speech he gave in Trenton, New Jersey in 1861, he referred to the American people as “His almost chosen people.” The “His” refers, of course, to God. The Americans stand, one almost dares to say, in the place of the Jews in a covenantal relationship with God. The idea that some institution or some people replaced the Jews in their covenantal relationship was a familiar Christian theme. The Pilgrims brought the idea with them as they founded their first settlements. Now Lincoln comes close to repeating the Puritan idea. This accounts, I believe, for the apparent redundancy in “brought forth on this continent.” His audience would surely have understood that Lincoln was talking about the United States “four score and seven years ago” without locating the events “on this continent.” But this continent was the locus of the new covenant. The Pilgrims had made a journey to a new land, and the new land promised a partnership with God that was not possible without an exodus from the old world. The single word “continent,” reminding us of the journey, invokes an entire theology.<n>We should remember that although the Declaration of Independence overflows with references to the Creator and the imprint of the Divine in American destiny, the Constitution of 1787 is a totally secular document. In style as well as substance, Lincoln returns to the religiosity of the 1776 Declaration.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt
Equality flourishes in an environment of mutual sympathy and reciprocal identification. The love for each and the needs of each come to the fore in the affective bonds of family, friendship, tribe, and, by extension, in the reciprocal attachments of nationhood. The limited political sphere of the nation facilitates the recognition of others as human beings sharing a common history. If blacks and whites, Northerners and Southerners, eventually men and women, could respect each other as Americans participating in the same national drama, they would lay a foundation for affirming their mutual equality. They need not be brothers and not exactly friends, but they could at last recognize each other as compatriots with a common language, a single history, and a shared future.<n>The source for this association between bonds of affection and equality lies outside the Judeo-Christian tradition, notably in the philosophy of the ancient Greeks. The fullest development comes in Aristotle’s Politics and in the Nicomachean Ethics. The idea of universal human equality was foreign to Aristotle, but he did believe in the mutual recognition of equality within the bonds of friendship and other close associations. Indeed, wishing well for the other as an end in himself is an essential component of philia or friendship understood broadly, and this sentiment, Aristotle believed, provides the necessary foundation for all virtuous behavior.11<n>Equality appears as a central theme in the virtue of justice as well as friendship. The just person is one who pays due regard to his own interests as well as to those of others. He is able to maintain the proper balance between his own interests and those of others. This is an aspect of distributive justice that generally requires each person to receive a due or proportionate share of the good to be distributed. Aristotle describes this proportion as an expression of geometric equality. Similarly, when one person wrongs another, some correction is necessary. This species of justice is also based on equality, understood arithmetically. The wrongdoer and the victim should both be restored to the state they were in prior to the wrong. This might be done by compelling the wrongdoer to pay compensation from the gains that he has received in order to make up the loss to the victim.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt
Nonetheless, writing for the majority, Justice Miller constructed a plausible theory of what it should mean to be a citizen of the United States. The picture presented is something like the posture of a supplicant toward a distant protector. The citizen should be able to address representatives of the U.S. government in person, make claims against the higher power, and receive its protection as a citizen abroad or on the high seas. None of this is particularly radical, and it fails, to be sure, to incorporate the commitments to nationhood and equality bequeathed by the Civil War.<n>On these larger issues, the opinion of the Court proves to be a great historical disappointment. The Miller opinion’s perception of our unity as a nation comes across in this remarkable sentence:<n>And quoting from the language of Chief Justice Taney in another case, it is said “that for all the great purposes for which the Federal government was established, we are one people, with one common country, we are all citizens of the United States. . . .”28<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
Justice Harlan’s position eventually triumphed—but not until our own time. After a long process of litigation, addressed primarily to the constitutionality of New Deal welfare legislation, the courts expanded the authority of Congress to legislate on all matters affecting “interstate commerce.”44 This became the basis for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which finally enacted the broad-gauged protection against discrimination that the Court had declared beyond the competence of Congress in 1883. Grounding congressional competence to counteract discrimination in its power to regulate interstate commerce smacked of legal convolution. The better ground would have been precisely the original claim of authority asserted by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1875.<n>Justice Harlan’s fidelity to Lincoln’s vision of the postbellum constitutional order becomes clear in his appeal to the concept of nationhood. Of all the opinions surveyed in leading cases decided in the aftermath of the Civil War, Harlan’s is the only one that comes close to conceptualizing the United States as a nation acting as a single unit. When the term appears in the other opinions, it is always as the adjective “national.” Yet, Harlan’s opinion is studded with references that replicate the usage that we heard in the Gettysburg Address and then found in selected poetry and philosophy written at the time. The nation is not just a government. It is an organic entity, a source of authority. As Harlan repeats nearly thirty times in the course of his opinion, the “nation has liberated”45 the slaves, “the nation has established universal freedom in this country,”46 and blacks, denied citizenship in the Dred Scott decision, acquired their equal citizenship “in virtue of an affirmative grant from the nation.”47<n>Reasoning like Orestes Brownson or Frances Lieber, Justice Harlan distinguished clearly between the nation and the federal or national government. The nation is not a constituted government. It is rather the source of authority that legitimates government. This conception of nationhood, synonymous with the spirit of Gettysburg, is evident in expressions stressing the logical priority of the nation’s will. For example, Harland writes that to insure that “the purposes of the nation might not be doubted or defeated . . . the Fourteenth Amendment was proposed for adoption.”48 Equally poignant are passages that treat the rights and privileges of the Constitution as “derived from the nation”49 or that stress “what the nation through Congress has sought to accomplish.”50<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
Exemption from race discrimination in respect of the civil rights which are fundamental in citizenship in a republican government, is, as we have seen, a new right, created by the nation, with express power in Congress, by legislation, to enforce the constitutional provision from which it is derived.51<n>It is clear in this passage that the nation, as distinct from government, creates rights, grants citizenship; it has objectives that it seeks to accomplish, but it must act through the prescribed processes of the law. The nation acts initially in the process of constitutional amendment, and then, by means of delegated authority, through the Congress. The nation has expressed its will by precisely these means in the Reconstruction Amendments, which delegated Congress authority to engage in the kind of legislation under attack in the Civil Rights Cases. The logic of the argument traces the genesis of the nation-state. First the nation comes into being as a prelegal organic unity, and then the nation expresses itself in a governmental structure.<n>One might properly inquire how the idea of the nation’s expressing its will differs from “We the People” acting in concert for the sake of a better government. The differences are admittedly subtle. Perhaps the accent in Justice Harlan’s mind was on the historical bond implied in the war that held the nation together. Yet, it is no accident that the expression “We the People” is absent in the rhetoric of his dissenting opinion. The problem he addressed was not one that the people could decide for themselves. The question “Who constitutes the nation?” does not lend itself to democratic resolution. The question of nationhood logically precedes both government and the popular will. For the nation to express itself as “government of the people,” it must first come into being.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
One might properly inquire how the idea of the nation’s expressing its will differs from “We the People” acting in concert for the sake of a better government. The differences are admittedly subtle. Perhaps the accent in Justice Harlan’s mind was on the historical bond implied in the war that held the nation together. Yet, it is no accident that the expression “We the People” is absent in the rhetoric of his dissenting opinion. The problem he addressed was not one that the people could decide for themselves. The question “Who constitutes the nation?” does not lend itself to democratic resolution. The question of nationhood logically precedes both government and the popular will. For the nation to express itself as “government of the people,” it must first come into being.<n>The nation does not constitute itself by popular vote or by a decision of government. The nation comes alive, as Lincoln viewed our history, as a bond forged in an historical struggle. The bond was first cast in 1774 with the first stirring of independence or, at the latest, in July 1776. The inclusion of emancipated slaves within the nation came as the only consequence of the Brothers’ War that could make sense of the national search for redemption.<n>Remarkably, the eight justices who signed the Court’s opinion invalidating the Civil Rights Act of 1875 used the vocabulary neither of peoplehood nor of nationhood. They had no conception of the American nation—or at least not one relevant to their legal analysis. Of course, they refer to the national government, a phrase in which “national” is synonymous with “federal” or “central.” Yet, they use the term “nation” in reference to France!52 I suppose that in the minds of the majority of justices, the United States constituted not a nation but a people still living under the Constitution they had designed and ratified in the 1780s.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
Schrödinger reached the correct conclusion: If genes are constituted by as few as several hundred atoms, the familiar statistical fluctuations predicted by statistical mechanics would be so large that heritability would be essentially impossible. Spontaneous mutations would happen at a frequency vastly larger than observed. The source of order must lie elsewhere.<n>Quantum mechanics, argued Schrödinger, comes to the rescue of life. Quantum mechanics ensures that solids have rigidly ordered molecular structures. A crystal is the simplest case. But crystals are structurally dull. The atoms are arranged in a regular lattice in three dimensions. If you know the positions of all the atoms in a minimal-unit crystal, you know where all the other atoms are in the entire crystal. This overstates the case, for there can be complex defects, but the point is clear. Crystals have very regular structures, so the diVerent parts of the crystal, in some sense, all “say” the same thing. As shown below, Schrödinger translated the idea of “saying” into the idea of “encoding.” With that leap, a regular crystal cannot encode much “information.” All the information is contained in the unit cell.<n>If solids have the order required but periodic solids such as crystals are too regular, then Schrödinger puts his bet on aperiodic solids. The stuV of the gene, he bets, is some form of aperiodic crystal. The form of the aperiodicity will contain some kind of microscopic code that somehow controls the development of the organism. The quantum character of the aperiodic solid will mean that small discrete changes, or mutations, will occur. Natural selection, operating on these small discrete changes, will select out favorable mutations, as Darwin hoped.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
The telltale beginnings of that larger story are beginning to be formulated. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Agency has had a long program in “exobiology,” the search for life elsewhere in the universe. Among its well-known interests are SETI, a search for extraterrestrial life, and the Mars probes. Over the past three decades, a sustained eVort has included a wealth of experiments aiming at discovering the abiotic origins of the organic molecules that are the building blocks of known living systems.<n>In the summer of 1997, NASA was busy attempting to formulate what it came to call “astrobiology,” an attempt to understand the origin, evolution, and characteristics of life anywhere in the universe. Astrobiology does not yet exist = it is a field in the birthing process. Whatever the area comes to be called as it matures, it seems likely to be a field of spectacular success and deep importance in the coming century. A hint of the potential impact of astrobiology came in August 1997 with the tentative but excited reports of a Martian meteorite found in Antarctica that, NASA scientists announced, might have evidence of early Martian microbial life. The White House organized the single-day “Space Conference,” to which I was pleased to be invited. Perhaps thirty-five scientists and scholars gathered in the Old Executive OYce Building for a meeting led by Vice President Gore. The vice president began the meeting with a rather unexpected question to the group: If it should prove true that the Martian rock actually harbored fossilized microbial life, what would be the least interesting result?<n>The room was silent, for a moment. Then Stephen Jay Gould gave the answer many of us must have been considering: “Martian life turns out to be essentially identical to Earth life, same DNA, RNA, proteins, code.” Were it so, then we would all envision life flitting from planet to planet in our solar system. It turns out that a minimum transit time for a fleck of Martian soil kicked into space to make it to earth is about fifteen thousand years. Spores can survive that long under desiccating conditions.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
Oster and Perelson had been concerned about accounting for the fact that humans can make about a hundred million diVerent antibody molecules. Why, they wondered. They conceived of an abstract shape space with perhaps seven or eight “dimensions.” Three of these dimensions would correspond to the three spatial dimensions, length, height, and width of a molecular binding site. Other dimensions might correspond to physical properties of the binding sites of molecules, such as charge, dipole moment, and hydrophobicity.<n>A point in shape space would represent a molecular shape. An antibody binds its shape complement, key and lock. But the precision with which an antibody can recognize its shape complement is finite. Some jiggle room is allowed. So an antibody molecule “covers” a kind of “ball” of complementary shapes in shape space. And then comes the sweet argument. If an antibody covers a ball, an actual volume, in shape space, then a finite number of balls will suYce to cover all of shape space. A reasonable analogy is that a finite number of Ping-Pong balls will fill up a bedroom.<n>But how big of a Ping-Pong ball in shape space is covered by one antibody? Oster and Perelson reasoned that in order for an immune system to protect an organism against disease, its antibody repertoire should cover a reasonable fraction of shape space. Newts, with about ten thousand diVerent antibody molecules, have the minimal known antibody diversity. Perelson and Oster guessed that the newt repertoire must cover a substantial fraction, say about 1/e = where e is the natural base for logarithms = or 37 percent of shape space. Dividing 37 percent by 10,000 gives the fractional volume of shape space covered by one antibody molecule. It follows that 100,000,000 such balls, thrown at random into shape space and allowed to overlap one another, will saturate shape space. So, 100 million antibody molecules is all we need to recognize virtually any shape of the size scale of molecular binding sites.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
After exploring Maxwell’s demon, I will ask a physicist’s question, What is work? Physicists have an answer  work is force acting through distance  given by a single number, or scalar, representing the sum of the force acting through the distance. But it will turn out that in any specific case of work, the specific process is organized in some specific way. Work is more than force acting through distance; it is, in fact, the constrained release of energy, the release of energy into a small number of degrees of freedom. It is the constraints themselves  with, as Phil Anderson points out, a kind of rigidity  that largely constitute the organization of the process. But  and here will be the hook  in many cases it takes work to construct the constraints themselves. So we will come to a terribly important circle, work is the constrained release of energy, but it often takes work to construct the constraints.<n>A conceptual cluster lies at the heart of the mystery. The cluster concerns the progressive emergence of organization in the evolution of the physical universe and of a biosphere. That emerging organization concerns the appearance in the evolving universe of entities measuring relevant rather than nonrelevant properties of nonequilibrium systems, by which they identify sources of energy that can perform work. Then physical entities appear that construct constraints on and couplings to the release of the identified source of energy whereby the energy is actually released and work comes to be performed. Such work often comes to be used to construct further detectors of energy sources and entities that harbor constraints on the release of energy, which when released constitutes work that constructs still further sources of energy and constraints on its release. It should be clear that we have at present no theories about these matters, nor even a clear concept of the subject matter of such theories.<n>The heart of the mystery concerns a proper understanding of “organization” and “propagating, diversifying organization.” Most profoundly, the mystery concerns the historical appearance since the big bang of connected structures of matter, energy, and processes by which an increasing diversity of kinds of matter, sources of energy, and types of processes come into existence in a biosphere, or in the universe itself. This is what lies directly before us but which we have not been able to see. A biosphere does all the above. Ours has for four billion years of awesome, ill-understood creativity. Doubt it? Open your eyes and look around you.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
Szilard took a first step in thinking about what Shannon later called information. Roughly Szilard realized that when the demon lets a faster or a slower gas particle pass specifically into the left or right box, respectively, then the total entropy of the system is decreasing a little bit. But in turn Szilard estimated the amount of work that must be done by the demon to discriminate that the gas particle is faster or slower than average. It turns out that the work that must be done, hence the energy utilized, equals the work that can later be extracted from the system after the fast and slow particles are separated into the two boxes. Since the work done by the demon equals the work that later can be extracted from the system, no net work can be extracted from the equilibrium system, and the second law is saved.<n>The link to information due to Shannon comes next. Shannon was concerned with transmitting signals down wires. He brilliantly thought of the minimal signal as a yes or no answer, hence representable as the binary or , now called a “bit.” Shannon considered the entropy of a source sending a prospective signal as the set of possible messages that might be sent, where each message was to be weighted by the probability of actually being sent. He thought of receiving a message as reducing the entropy, or uncertainty, about which message was actually sent, given the initial set of possible messages. Thus, Shannon wound up reinventing the same mathematics that covers entropy. Here there is an ensemble of messages, and each can be thought of as occupying a volume in a space of possible messages. Each message is sent with some probability from the source. So Shannon took the logarithm of the volume in message space occupied by a message and multiplied it by the probability that that message was sent from the source. If the fraction of the total volume of message space occupied by a given message is “p,” then the logarithm of this volume is “logp” and the probability of that volume is “p.” Thus, the logarithm of a probability of a message multiplied by that probability itself is “plogp.” The sum of these “plogp” terms for the total set of messages at the source is the entropy of the source. Reception of a signal reduces the receiver’s uncertainty about what is being sent from the source, hence is a negative entropy. Shannon’s information measure is, thus, just the negative of the normal entropy measure.<n>The link established by Szilard between information and Maxwell’s demon is, roughly, that the discrimination by the demon that a given gas molecule is faster or slower than average and whether it is coming from the left or right box (hence, whether he should open or close the flap valve) constitutes a measurement that extracts information about the gas system, hence, lowers the uncertainty about the gas system, hence, lowers the entropy of the gas system.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
Category theory is a branch of mathematics concerning mappings. Consider a “domain” and a “range.” A mapping takes points in the domain to points in the range. The mappings might be :, or :many, or many:. For example, in a : mapping, each point in the domain maps to a single corresponding point in the range. The domain and range can be discrete sets or continuous.<n>An interesting feature of categories is that a category can have the property that the mapping from the domain to the range is specified by the category itself in a recursive way; the elements of the range determine the mapping from the domain to the range. This recursive specification comes close to an autocatalytic set. We need merely think of a set of molecular species in the domain and a set of molecular species in the range; the mapping from domain to range is just the set of reactions that transform the initial “substrate molecules” in the domain to the “product molecules” in the range. Now, an autocatalytic set has the property that certain product molecules in the range, namely the products that are also catalysts, “choose” the reactions that are catalyzed from the substrates to the products, hence, choose the specific mapping from the domain to the range. Thus, an autocatalytic set can be thought of as this kind of recursive category.<n>The category theory image is at least a start with respect to catalytic closure. Perhaps some enhanced category theory that includes closures of work tasks, measurements, and records, as well as catalysis, is part of what an adequate formalization of “autonomous agent” may be. It is too early to say.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
rom a biosphere and its mysteries, this investigation now steps gingerly toward the cosmos. Caveat lector: I am not a physicist.<n>Our now familiar liter of gas particles at room temperature comes to equilibrium rapidly, certainly on the order of hours or days. “Equilibrium” means, roughly, that the macroscopic properties of the system, such as temperature and pressure, have stopped changing, except for small “square root N” fluctuations away from equilibrium that soon dissipate back toward equilibrium. As we have noted, thanks to the ergodic hypothesis, the gas system ultimately visits each macrostate at a number of times proportional to the number of microstates in that macrostate. For equilibrium with respect to all macroscopic properties to have been attained, it is not necessary that all microstates have been sampled, of course, but that the statistical distribution of microstates approaches the equilibrium distribution.<n>Physicist Richard Feynman noted that equilibrium is when “all the fast things have happened, and the slow ones have not.” His dictum suggests, accurately, that the notion of equilibrium is not quite so self-evident.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
The small molecule diversity in the blender is presumably on the order of billions, the protein and polymer diversity is on the order of hundreds of trillions, thus . Assuming that any pair of molecular species can undergo at least one two substrate–two product reaction, the total number of reactions is, as noted above, the square of the molecular diversity, so is about . If the probability that any one protein species catalyzes any one reaction is, say, one in a trillion, or , then the expected number of catalyzed reactions is just the product of the number of reactions times the number of potential protein catalysts, divided by the probability that a given protein catalyzes a given reaction. This yields reactions times proteins divided by , which equals . In short, virtually all possible reactions will be catalyzed by something. Indeed, on average, each possible reaction will find dierent protein catalysts. A vast sustained explosion into the adjacent possible would occur. Ergo, the biosphere is supracritical. More precisely, the biosphere would be supracritical if all molecular species could be in eective contact with one another on short timescales. But all molecular species do not come in contact with one another willy-nilly, for molecular species are packaged into cells.<n>It is critical to note that individual cells are not supracritical. The crude argument says that a cell’s metabolism has about organic molecules. Consider squirting a novel molecule, Q, into a cell. Presumably Q can be one member of two substrates with each of these organic molecules. Thus, addition of Q to the cell aords about novel reactions. Let the protein diversity of the cell be bounded by the human number of genes at ,. Any such protein has evolved for some tasks, but may contain molecular nooks and crannies that can serve as novel catalytic sites. The expected number of novel catalyzed reactions due to the presence of Q is given by the product of the number of potential protein catalysts times the number of novel reactions made available by injection of Q into the cell, divided by the probability that any protein catalyzes any given reaction. The product of potential catalysts (the proteins) and the reactions is ,,, or . The best current guess at the probability that a randomly chosen protein catalyzes a randomly chosen reaction comes from the probability that a monoclonal antibody canalyzes a reaction and, as discussed above, is about one in a billion. If so, the expected number of the novel reactions that will be catalyzed when Q is squirted into a cell is ,, divided by ,,,, or .. Since . is less than , on average, no chains of novel reactions are catalyzed and cells are subcritical.<n>If the probability of catalysis is one only in a trillion (as used in the calculation to see if the biosphere as a whole is supracritical), rather than one in a billion, then cells are even more deeply subcritical. With catalysis only one in a trillion, the expected number of catalyzed reactions in a cell upon addition of Q is ..<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
These results were presented in At Home in the Universe but are needed here. Since they are publicly available, I will be brief.<n>The NK model is a simple toy world in which an organism has N genes. Each gene comes in two “alleles,” or versions, or . Each allele of each gene makes a contribution to the fitness of the organism that depends on the allele of that gene and upon the alleles of K other genes. In genetics, these K other genes are called “epistatic” inputs to the fitness contribution of a given gene. The to the N combinations of alleles of the N genes are therefore located on the vertices of the N-dimensional hypercube, like Figure .. The fitness of each type of organism, or vertex, is written on that vertex and can be thought of as a height. Hence, the NK model creates a fitness landscape over the N-dimensional Boolean hypercube. To keep matters simple, I assume all critters have a single chromosome, that is, are haploids. When they are not feeling sexy, bacteria will do as an example.<n>Having chosen N and K, say N = and K = , the rest is done at random in the hopes that generic features of N and K will show up in the resulting statistical structure of the fitness landscape (Figure .a–c). In one limiting case, the K inputs to each of the N genes are chosen at random from among the N. Each gene has two alleles, and . The fitness contribution of that gene is aected by which of its alleles occurs and by which of the or alleles of K other epistatic input genes occurs. Thus, each gene’s fitness contribution is aected by K + genes.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
The results are shown in Figure .. Indeed, landscape ruggedness does evolve to an intermediate ruggedness. During this evolution, the mean interval between extinction events increases dramatically, hence, the mean number of extinction events decreases. In this sense, all the creatures that remain become fitter due to the coevolutionary tuning of landscape ruggedness. In addition, when Godzilla’ replaces the hapless species that now goes extinct, its econeighbors find themselves interacting with Godzilla’ itself. They may not be as fit interacting with Godzilla’ as with the first species, hence, they too may be invaded and driven extinct in turn.<n>In short, avalanches of extinction events can propagate. Figure . shows that the distribution is a power law, with many small and few large extinction events. Moreover, once a new species comes into existence, say, Godzilla’, it may not fare well in its new niche, hence, may go extinct soon. But if it lasts in its niche, it may be well adapted, hence, resistant to being driven extinct. The results (Figure .a) are a power law distribution of species lifetimes.<n>Thus, this model shows an invisible hand in which natural selection, acting on individuals only, tunes landscape ruggedness. All players are, on average, fitter in the sense of surviving as species for much longer periods, yet the ecosystem appears self-organized critical with a power law distribution of extinction events. Species lifetime distributions are also power laws.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
The NK model is but one crude model of coevolving organisms and their coupled deforming landscapes. More generally, each organism has traits that are aected by many genes, the polygeny discussed above, and each gene aects many traits, the pleiotropy alluded to above. It is interesting to note that were organisms to evolve to a position below but near the biological reality that is the proper analogue of the Ksat phase transition, such a location might well achieve the gradualism and capacity to persistently evolve that Darwin noted and that we observe. Both the gradualism and capacity to evolve are related to the number of alternative assignments of true or false to the V variables that satisfy the Ksat normal disjunctive form. If there are connected pathways from one such assignment via -Hamming-mutant neighboring assignments that all satisfy the normal disjunctive form, then adaptive walks via alternatives genotypes are available, all of which roughly generate the same organism. Gradualism is achieved. Polygeny and pleiotropy tune landscape ruggedness and deformability, which tune coevolutionary dynamics, perhaps to a self-organized critical state of an ecosystem.<n>There are, in short, dimly understood laws that allow the coevolutionary construction of accumulating complexity. And it appears that such coevolution typically is self-organized critical. The NK coevolutionary model is not the only example of a model exhibiting self-organized critical behavior of model ecosystems. Bak and colleagues, Ricard Solé, and others have created elegant models aiming in the same direction. In particular, Solé’s model comes closest to fitting the actual slopes of the observed power laws, which are -.<n>Candidate Law 4: Expanding the Adjacent Possible in a Self-Organized Critical Way<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
For a single good, the problem is simple. But consider bread and butter. Since many of us like butter on our bread, the demand for butter depends not only on the price and hence the supply of butter, but also on the price of bread, hence on the supply of bread. And vice versa, the demand for bread depends upon the price of butter and hence on the supply of butter. For thousands of goods, where the demand for any one good depends upon the price of many goods and the supply of any one good depends upon the price of many goods, it is not so obvious that there is a price for each good such that all markets clear.<n>But worse, the supply or demand for bread today may be dierent than the supply or demand for bread tomorrow. And still worse, the supply or demand for bread tomorrow may depend on all sorts of odd contingent facts. For example, if severe cold kills the winter wheat next month, the supply of bread will drop; if a bumper crop of winter wheat comes available globally because of weather or suddenly improved irrigation and farming practices worldwide, the supply will go up.<n>Arrow and Debreu made brilliant steps. First, they consider a space of all possible dated and contingent goods. One of their examples of a “dated contingent good” is “ ton of wheat delivered in Chicago on May , , under the condition that the average rainfall in Nebraska for the six preceding months has been percent less than normal for the past fifty years and that the Boston Red Sox won the World Series the previous year.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
So, here is a new view of process design and inventory control.<n>Bios colleague Jim Herriot has made a delightful little Java computer model to show technology graphs in action. The program shows a “chair” object, a “seat” object, a “back” object, and a “leg” object. In addition, there are “foam” and “padding” objects, two “attachment” objects, a set of “screw” objects, “nail” objects, “wood” objects, a “saw” object, a “hammer” object, and a “screwdriver” object. Each object comes with its own characteristic set of “is a,” “has a,” “does a,” features.<n>The program assembles coherent technology graphs and chair-assembly pathways as follows: An object tries a connection, shown by a black line, to another object. In eect, the chair object extends a line to the screw object as it says, “I need a lean-on! I need a lean-on!” The screw object responds, “I do twist holds, I do twist holds!” There is no match. After many random tries, the “chair” object extends a black line to the “back” object. “I need a lean-on, I need a lean-on,” says the “chair” object. “I do lean-ons, I do lean-ons,” cries the “back” object with cybernetic joy. The black line becomes a yellow line as a contract is signed between the “chair” and “back” objects. In a similar way, the “back” object needs “padding” and “wood” objects, and either the complementary pair “nail and hammer” objects or their substitutes, “screw and screwdriver” objects, to carry out an “attachment” operation.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
I happen to like Collegiate Gothic buildings. I like their dark rooms with wood paneling, hammer-beam ceilings, and traditional oak furniture. But seeing the York student center made me realize that whenever I walk through these old buildings I also experience a nagging dissatisfaction. It has to do with the students. The young men and women in baseball caps, shorts, stenciled sweat shirts, and iridescent nylon windbreakers just don’t fit in. They should be wearing boaters and blazers, tweeds and flannels. Of course, no student that I have ever seen—including at Oxford—dresses that way. I may deplore the loss of decorum, but as an architect I can’t do anything to change it. It is the building that must do the accommodating.<n>If the relationship between dress and décor is intimate, it is also one-sided. Interior decorators and architects will bridle at this, but there is no doubt that dress comes first. “People have always worn what they wanted to wear,” writes Anne Hollander, “fashion exists to keep fulfilling that desire.”6 And architecture must follow. For the truth is that a building—no matter how useful or well built or beautiful—that is not sympathetic to the way that people dress risks looking not merely anachronistic, but downright silly. Like it or not, architecture cannot escape fashion.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch1.txt
in and out of fashion<n>Bryant Park, in midtown Manhattan, is the site of a bi-annual fashion show. Twice a year, in large white tents crammed with reporters, photographers, editors, and celebrity guests, models parade designers’ wares on the runway. Bryant Park is also a good place to observe an architectural fashion show. A row of Twenties beauties lines 40th Street, along the south side of the park. First is Ely Jacques Kahn’s French Renaissance office building, originally the headquarters of Scientific American. Its neighbor is the stately Classical Engineers Club. Then comes a flapper, Raymond Hood’s American Radiator Building, whose black brick and gold trim sets it apart from its neighbors. Charles Rich’s Bryant Park Studios, an elegant survivor of the late Gilded Age, is at the Sixth Avenue corner. The large north-facing windows and glazed penthouse are a reminder that this building was originally intended for artists.<n>Bryant Park Studios is built in an architectural style that was originally called Modern French but today is commonly referred to as Beaux-Arts, in recognition of the influential Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Starting with Richard Morris Hunt, during the second half of the nineteenth century many of the best American architects were graduates of the Ecole. H. H. Richardson and his protégé Charles Follen McKim were alumni, as well as McKim’s assistants, John M. Carrère and Thomas Hastings. Carrère and Hastings were the architects of the New York Public Library, whose stately presence commands the east side of Bryant Park. Narrow strips of windows indicate the book-stacks, above them nine thermal windows signal the vast reading room. In typical Beaux-Arts fashion, the façade manages to appear both grandly monumental and coolly rational, except for a curious row of little doorways high up the wall, which lack balconies or even railings and open into mid-air. The strange little sky-exits, which a friend who works at the library claims are for staff defenestration, provide a fanciful note to the great marble façade.*<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch2.txt
Vanderbilt was drawn to French chateaux, which Hunt showed him during a whirlwind European tour, since young George and his wealthy family imagined themselves American aristocrats. There are coats of arms bearing Vs all over the house. Hunt provides his client with an imagined regal setting, but deals with the past in his own peculiar way. Although he modeled the building on Blois, he makes no attempt to create a replica of the sixteenth-century chateau, but draws details from other buildings of the period and recombines them into an original whole. Nor does he try to create the illusion that this is a sixteenth-century building—there is no artificial weathering, no aging effect no simulated historicism. The interior is modern, bright, and open. The focus of the main floor is a glass-roofed conservatory, a common nineteenth-century feature. The stonework of the house is impeccable, much crisper and more sharply defined than at Blois. Hunt was no antiquarian, and modern American technology abounds. The floors of fireproof hollow tile are supported by steel I-beams and the steep slate roofs by steel roof trusses. Cast iron replaces wrought iron and high-quality bricks, fired in the estate brickworks, back-up the limestone walls. Equally novel are the elevators and telephones, electrical lighting, hot and cold running water, and forced air central heating. There is no doubt that for Hunt, Biltmore is an up-to-the-minute modern building. That is part of its style, too.<n>Like Hunt, Frank Gehry enlists novel materials in his buildings. The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, for example, is clad in titanium, previously used chiefly for building aircraft. The metallic walls curve, twist, and turn. One part of the building slides under an adjoining bridge; another emerges from a reflecting pool. Bilbainos refer to the museum as the “artichoke,” which comes close to describing it, if you can imagine a gleaming, metallic artichoke more than two hundred feet high. The seeming disorder—a chaotic collision of forms—has no architectural precedent. This is not sculptural architecture, it is walk-in sculpture.<n>“The plan is the generator” preached Le Corbusier, but with Gehry, the plan is the result. He appears to design from the outside in. The building as a composition comes first, the interior spaces follow. This implies that he shoehorns functions into the building, which is not the case. The Guggenheim has three distinct types of gallery spaces: traditional, skylit rooms for displaying its permanent collection of early Modernist art; a long boat-like space for temporary installations; and 11 smaller galleries, each with its own character, each dedicated to the works of a selected living artist. The artichoke accommodates them all. The building may appear offhanded, but there is nothing haphazard about the way it is organized.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch3.txt

And, of course, to find ways to build those forms. This is generally done without fuss. The titanium sheets simply follow the churning surfaces like shingles on a Shingle Style roof; limestone is used in a similarly unaffected fashion, without articulated joints. Gehry shares a minimalist approach to details with the early architects of the International Style, but he deploys these details to different ends.

Lagoa, a sizeable town east of Portimão, is the province’s wine capital. The acidic vinhos da casa served in most restaurants on the Algarve come from here. Lagoa wine, both red and white, is more powerful than ordinary wine, and the extra degree or two of alcoholic content can creep up on you. The local tourist office can arrange tours of wineries and tastings (Adega de Cooperativa de Lagoa; Tel. 282/342 181; 24 hours in advance). New golf courses are being built in the area, but there’s little else to detain visitors.<n>From Lagoa, turn south about 5 km (3 miles) to the charming resort of Carvoeiro, an archetypal small Barlavento resort. The beach is about the size of a tablecloth compared with some of the expanses to the east. A single road runs down through a pretty valley until it comes to a small crescent of sand shared by families of sunbathers and fishing boats. Above, rows of bright white houses perch on red sandstone cliffs while cafés and restaurants fill the spaces in between. The original village of Carvoeiro is now fairly commercialized, but to many people it remains one of the coast’s most attractive resorts.<n>A narrow road follows the cliffs eastwards to the geological curiosity of Algar Seco (“dry gully”). Among other weird and wonderful shapes, wind and wave erosion have created a double-decker stone arch. There are walkways down to a lagoon enclosed by menacing rocks, and if weather conditions are calm, this open-air grotto is a paradise for snorkelers.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
Amsterdammers seem to have the ability to find creative solutions to the problems of their world. When there wasn’t enough housing on the land, they looked at the empty canals and decided that houseboats would help. There are now over 2,500 on the waterways of the city. When cars became a problem in the old town they gave the bicycle priority, and now there are over 1,000,000 on the streets — and an estimated 30,000 at the bottom of the canal system at any one time! You’ll quickly learn to listen for the warning bells and stand clear as their riders pedal by.<n>Perhaps the most widely publicized acts of tolerance in recent history have been in the areas of sex and drugs. Amsterdammers looked at feasible and practical responses to the issues, and decriminalized some aspects of both. This does not make the city one huge den of iniquity and these areas are still controlled and regulated; in fact, you could visit Amsterdam and be quite unaware of these activities. There’s just a recognition here that provided no harm comes to you or others around you, then you should be free, as an adult, to make your own choices.<n>Amsterdammers fight for everyone’s rights against oppression, or the right of David to stand against the faceless Goliath of bureaucracy. In fact in Amsterdam several thousand Davids get together to form a pressure group, and Goliath has to sit up and take notice. This doesn’t mean that Amsterdam is utopia — it is a city of 21st-century pressures, particularly with continuing problems of traffic and litter — but it does mean that the problems are faced realistically, debated passionately by the whole community, and agreed solutions are put into action. When the solutions don’t work (as they often don’t) the whole process starts over again. It is all seen as part of a huge learning curve.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-Intro.txt
Once inside, the sheer scale of the church is immediate and impressive. Commemorative tombstones cover the floor, including that of Saskia, Rembrandt’s wife. The stained glass windows are also impressive. One commemorates the Peace of Munster and shows a Spanish official handing over the charter recognizing the independent Dutch State. Several of the windows show Bible scenes on a majestic scale, but look also for the simple red door above which is written the advice “marry in haste, repent at leisure.”<n>The canalside streets of Oudezijds Voorburgwal and Oudezijds Achterburg southwest of Oude Kerk are home to the infamous Amsterdam Red Light District, known to Amsterdammers as the Walletjes or “little walls.” As with any large port, prostitution was rife from the earliest times, and although the Calvinist Protestants tried to stamp it out it has thrived to the present day. What makes the situation different in Amsterdam in modern times is that the industry has been legitimized and regulated in an attempt to curb the most disturbing facets of exploitation and in order to address health concerns. The prostitutes are entitled to regular health checks and are expected to pay taxes on their earnings — yet another example of the Dutch people’s trademark pragmatic approach when it comes to tackling society’s difficult issues. The area is safe — except perhaps in the early hours of the morning — and filled with tourists. The tree-lined canals and old narrow iron bridges are some of the prettiest in the city, and prostitutes ply their trade behind relatively discreet windows, not on the streets.<n>At ground level, seedy or amusing ( depending on your point of view) shops sell sex wares, attracting customers from all walks of life; but don’t get too distracted, else you’ll miss the rows of dainty gables, quirky wall plaques, and window boxes brimming with flowers, which give the whole area a cheery feel. Don’t be surprised to find offices, shops, and restaurants living side by side with the brothels here — it’s all part of Amsterdam life.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
In the early 19th century the weigh house closed and Waag had a number of less illustrious tenants; it even spent some time as a furniture store. It now houses a café/bar, so you can have a refreshment and admire the impressive Gothic interior at the same time.<n>Nieuwmarkt (New Market) surrounds the Waag and it is home to several different types of market throughout the week. If you walk to the north side of the Waag and look up the Gelderskade you will see a tower dominating the skyline. This is Schreierstoren, also part of the new city wall of 1480. City scholars are divided as to the reason for the tower’s name. Some say it comes from the word schreien which means “weeping” as it was a place where sailors’ weeping wives came to wave their men off to sea. Other say that the name is a derivation of scherpe, which means “sharp” — denoting the towers position on a 90-degree bend in the wall.<n>From Waag walk down Sint Antoniesbreestraat, past modern apartment blocks built for the workers of the city in the 1970s. On your right you will see the ornate tower of Zuiderkerk (South Church). This church was the first place of worship to be built following the Reformation and was begun in 1603. Designed by Hendrick de Keyser, its lines were much admired by Sir Christopher Wren, architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. It was de-consecrated in 1929 and is now a community information center.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Raadhuisstaat is the main thoroughfare to the northwestern canal ring and is busy with trams, buses, and cars. It will take you quickly to the main attractions of the area but it is not the prettiest or quietest route. Wandering the smaller alleys and lanes to the north and south of it will be much more fulfilling (the details of the highlights of each of the major canals can be seen on page 66). Follow Raadhuisstraat until you reach the Westerkerk, set in its own square on the left and overlooking Prinsengracht. This church was designed by de Keyser in 1619 and was one of his last commissions. It is said to be the burial place of Rembrandt, but unfortunately no one knows knows the exact location. One of his pupils Gerard de Lairesse painted the organ panels, which were added in 1686. In summer you can climb the tower, the tallest in the city at 83m (273 ft), for incomparable views of the surrounding rooftops. The crown on top of the bell tower is a replica of the crown presented to the city in 1489 by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor.<n>Turn left beyond the church to Prinsengracht 263, just an ordinary canal house-cum-office but made famous worldwide by what happened here in WWII. This is Anne Frank Huis (Anne Frank House), where during the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam this young girl, her family, and a small group of others hid for two years in an attempt to avoid capture and deportation. Anne wrote a diary which paints a clear and terrifying picture of the life the family lived. It comes to an eerie stop only a few days before the family was discovered and sent to concentration camps. Of the eight people in hiding, only Anne’s father survived — Anne died of typhus only weeks before the war ended — and after the war, in 1947, he published the diary. It became not only an international bestseller but also a symbol for the oppression of humankind.<n>The house, built in 1635, has been left much as it was at the time that Anne hid here. It opened as a museum in 1960. The secret rooms upstairs, where the family spent the daylight hours, are stark and bleak. A couple of magazine pin-ups still adorn one wall. The wooden bookcase, which hid the doorway to their refuge, is still in situ, propped open for visitors to climb the few stairs to their home.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Entertainment<n>Athens comes alive after dark with a range of activities to fill your diary. However, you’ll probably need to alter your normal routine to enjoy it as the locals do. Theater performances are followed by a late leisurely dinner, often after 11pm, and if you intend to head out to a nightclub, don’t expect to start until around midnight.<n>Even if you only want to sample the delights of Greek tavernas and perhaps stroll around Plaka, the real atmosphere starts after 9pm when Greek families come out to eat. If you can hold your appetite that long you’ll have a much more authentic experience.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhatToDo.txt
Ceramics: The skills honed at Kerameik��s centuries ago are still much in evidence on the streets of Athens. You can buy exquisite hand-thrown and painted copies of ancient pieces for a price, and numerous examples of less expensive factory produced items. Traditional shapes of urns, jugs, and cups are decorated with scenes taken from the lives of the ancients or of the Greek gods in their domain on Mount Olympus. Modern ceramic artists also thrive and there are many small galleries showcasing hand created pieces.<n>Statuary: If you want a little piece of ancient Greece then you’ll certainly be able to find it. It will be a reproduction of course — but still you can own your own copy of Zeus, Poseidon, or Athena herself, small enough to grace a table or large enough to decorate a garden. Plaques depicting ancient friezes, or masks to hang on walls are also extremely popular, as are Mycenaean helmets. If classical statuary is too ornate for your taste, you can also find copies of the minimalist Mycenaean statues found at the Goulandris Museum. The National Archaeological Museum also has a wide range of copies of its artifacts. Each comes with a certificate of authentication.<n>Leatherware: Local craftsmen have always worked goat and cow hides and the industry continues today. Footwear, bags, and clothing come in a range of styles, though quality is generally more rustic and bohemian than similar items produced in Italy or France.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhatToDo.txt
Just beside the Agora you’ll see one of only two mosques still standing in the city — it now houses an archaeological workshop and is not open to the public. Nearby on Odós Diogenous is the Museum of Greek Folk Music with a fascinating collection of instruments and musical recordings bringing the varied regional folk music of Greece to life.<n>Continue along Adrianou to find the remains of the Ancient Greek Agora — birthplace of western democracy and the social heart of the ancient city-state of Athens (agora comes from the Greek agiero, meaning to assemble). From the sixth century b.c., this area played host to a number of activities including religious and political meetings, law courts, education, shopping, or simply passing the time of day. Here Socrates regaled the people with his philosophical theories — unfortunately for him he fell foul of the authorities and was put to death in 403 b.c. St. Paul met an audience of “skeptics” who argued against him when he gave a speech here in a.d. 51. The whole area was razed during Barbarian attacks in the centuries following the fall of the Roman Empire and was covered with new buildings during Byzantine times, all of which had to be cleared when excavations began.<n>From the entrance at Adrianou (there are two other entrances to the site) look immediately to your right to see remains of the Altar of the Twelve Gods; a small monument from where distances from Athens to all other points in the Greek world were measured. This was truly the center of the world during the Classical Greek era. Directly ahead in the area of the central Agora the outline of the Altar of Ares and Temple of Ares can be seen in gravel. Behind this, the remains of the Odeon of Agrippa, built in 15 b.c., and the Royal Palace overlaid by two later stoas can be discerned. In the southeast corner of the site, the 11th century church of Ayios Apostoloi is the only building on the site remaining from the Byzantine era. Greatly changed over the centuries it was fully restored to its original form in the late 1950s. The paintings in the narthex are original; others were transplanted from the Hephaisteion (see below) when it was deconsecrated.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
Hydra<n>Only 1 hour 15 minutes from Athens by hydrofoil, Hydra is the most exclusive of the Saronic islands, and your approach into the harbor is the most dramatic. The beautiful port of Hydra Town keeps its secret hidden until the very last moment and when the panorama comes into view it’s time to get the camera ready. Above the shoreline of the narrow cove lie a series of low hills, and each of these are blanketed with Neo-Classical Italianate mansions painted in myriad dusty hues. There are no cars on Hydra — only donkeys. No sandy beaches make the water some of the clearest in the area for snorkeling.<n>Still, most people don’t visit Hydra for any activity other than to “see and be seen.” In the 1960s the island was an artist colony and today it has developed into a place for the beautiful people. The boutiques are some of the most exclusive in the Mediterranean, intermingled with the Bohemian craft galleries, exclusive restaurants, tavernas, chic cafés, and Greek ouzeries.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
On top of the water, the shallow channels and sheltered seas provide ideal waters for sailing and cruising. Hundreds of unmanned cays offer idyllic destinations and mooring points. The desert island you always dreamed about is somewhere in the Bahamas — the Exumas themselves have one cay for every day of year, and that is only one part of the vast Commonwealth. Many lie only a few hours sailing time from the hubbub of Nassau.<n>The Bahamian people are among the friendliest you’ll ever meet, and they are eager to share the homeland they love with visitors. The population is a fascinating mixture of descendants of the Loyalist settlers who left America after the American Revolution, freedom lovers who escaped religious persecution, and ex-slaves set free following emancipation. This mixture, which could have produced a society fraught with problems, has evolved into a gentle, sociable, and happy people, proud of their homeland and the progress they have made since independence in 1973. With a stable economy, good health, and no taxes, it’s no wonder that a smile comes naturally to all Bahamians. All the communities still have strong religious faith, the pretty churches are full on Sundays, and a conversation about some future event always ends with “…God willing” or “…with the Lord’s blessing.”<n>To make the most of your trip you’ll need to tune your mind to “Bahamian time.” On New Providence and Grand Bahama this may not be much slower than at home, but on the Out Islands, time definitely runs more slowly, and nothing is so important that it can’t wait a while. People are more important than to-do lists, so a leisurely exchange of greetings and an inquiry about your family’s well-being precedes any business activity. This genuine thoughtfulness also extends to visitors; someone will always go out of their way to be helpful, in ways that have been lost in more developed locations.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-Intro.txt
The name Exuma is said to be a derivation of the two Lucayan Indian words that had been used for this group of islands, yumey and suma. The largest Exuma Cays were settled by British Loyalists following the American Revolution. Chief among these was Dennis Rolle, who brought over 100 slaves with him to start a cotton plantation. This venture began to fail after only a few years but Dennis passed the land onto his son John. In 1834 slavery was abolished and John Rolle freed his slaves and deeded the Rolle land on to them “in commonage” at his death. This allowed only those directly related to the Rolle slaves to farm or build on the inherited land. Today most of the native inhabitants of the Exumas bear the family name Rolle.<n>The Exumas are divided into three distinct sections: Great Exuma Island, Little Exuma Island, and the Exhuma Cays, which lie north of the main islands. The capital, George Town, on Great Exuma Island, is served by regular flights from Nassau and makes the most convenient base for non-sailors. It has a sleepy and laid-back atmosphere and offers a couple of hotels and restaurants. A compact straw and vegetable market sits at the main crossroads. The town lies on the coast at Elizabeth Harbour, a large, sheltered stretch of water that is a popular stopping off point for sailors. The quiet town comes to life every April when it hosts the Family Island Regatta. Thousands of Bahamian working boats fill Elizabeth Harbour, their crews vying for the right to call themselves champion of the regatta.<n>From George Town you can take the short ferry trip to nearby Stocking Cay. The ten-minute journey across the sound (courtesy of the Club Peace and Plenty hotel) takes you to an island of sublime beaches, underwater caves to dive in, and rocky inlets to explore by snorkel. You can find sand dollars and starfish and spot rays and turtles. The few holiday homes do nothing to spoil the natural beauty, and you’ll still be able to find a deserted beach in one of the many sheltered bays.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
Shops take advantage of the tourist traffic to sell the products of other islands, too — embroidery and songket fabrics from Sumatra, primitive art from Irian Jaya, and silver from Sulawesi.<n>Lombok: Craft skills in Lombok tend to be devoted to household objects that can have a somewhat austere functional beauty. Look for the delicate, tightly-woven basketware, whether in mats, boxes, bowls, and bags, or the common Lombok souvenir of a model rice-barn. Painted wood boxes to store spices, tobacco, or jewelry are attractive. Simple red pottery comes from Penujak, and black pots from Rungkang are bound in an intricately woven basket.<n>Necessities: Some supermarkets and convenience stores have opened in Denpasar, such as Tiara Dewata, on Jalan Jenderal Sutoyo, with books, shoes, cosmetics, and even a playground for children and a swimming pool. There is a similar big shopping center near the airport, while smaller ones can be found in Kuta, Nusa Dua, Senggigi, and Lombok. In big towns, modern grocery shops, with big red “K” signs (Circle K) are open 24 hours a day and sell all kinds of necessities.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhatToDo.txt
A short diversion eastwards will bring you to Blahbatuh, where the palace compound, Puri Blahbatuh, has turned into a commercial orchid nursery, sometimes referred to as Puri Anggrek (Orchid Palace).<n>Nearby, Belega specializes in bamboo, producing massive pieces of furniture. You’ll see them on display along the main street, and also in some of Bali’s hotels. Then comes Bona, a center of basketry which also bills itself as the home of the kecak dance. The regular performances here are certainly more complete than most versions.<n>Back on the road to Ubud: Mas is famous for its woodcarvers, furniture makers, and mask-carvers. Vast numbers of shops and workshops line the long main street. Unless a shop has been specifically recommended, just stop anywhere and look inside, without buying right away. Then investigate the side streets. Away from the traffic, you might find an entire family producing wooden hangings for the export market.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
A regular passenger and car ferry makes two or three sailings per day to Lombok. The voyage can be rough and may take longer than the scheduled four hours. Many visitors opt for the newer, faster, and more expensive twin-hull Mabua Express ferry from Benoa Port (see page 75), but backpackers and most locals prefer this traditional, albeit less comfortable, route. Fishermen land their catches at Padangbai’s small busy beach, which is jammed with boats, just to the north of the main jetty. Facing it at the far end are two or three simple but adequate cottage-style homestays. You can arrange diving or fishing trips here, but the water in the bay looks too dirty for swimming.<n>Beyond Padangbai comes the broad sweep of Amuk Bay, site of a controversial new oil terminal. At its eastern end, after the coast road crosses an iron bridge, a track leads down to the sea at the village of Buitan, also called Balina Beach, the name of its main hotel and SCUBA-diving center.<n>Candi Dasa (pronounced Chandi Dasa)<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Bangli<n>On the main road from the south towards Mount Batur, the chief town of the former rajadom of Bangli looks like a nursery for gorgeous flowering shrubs. It comes alive every three days for the big morning market in the central square. To the south of town on the Gianyar road is Pura Dalem Penuggekan, a typical example of the many temples for the dead: Carved friezes show the nightmarish tortures awaiting sinners in the after-life. On the northern outskirts, the chief temple of the former rajadom of Bangli, Pura Kehen, comprises the typical three courtyards, here particularly large and linked by steep flights of steps. The walls of the first were once encrusted with inset porcelain plates, but many have been broken or lost.<n>Around Lake Batur<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Around Lake Batur<n>The roads from the south climb out of the rice paddies of the lowlands, through coffee plantations and orchards at around 600 m (2,000 ft), eventually thinning out into open pasture. A band of rainforest blocks out the view until you emerge at 1,300 m (4,300 ft) on the narrow rim of a huge crater (technically a caldera or collapsed volcano), 11 km (7 miles) across and about 200 m (660 ft) deep. The pastel blue crescent of Lake Batur takes up the eastern third of the great bowl, and out of the center grows Mount Batur itself, bare rock streaked with black traces of old lava flows. Penelokan (“Place for Looking”) can offer a great panorama, but it’s an ugly village, at its worst when enveloped in a cold wet fog and you can’t see the view anyway. The peddlers here are the most aggressive in Bali: Balinese travelers have complained about them since long before the arrival of tourists. The height of confusion comes at lunchtime when the tour buses disgorge their passengers at the restaurants especially built for them. Avoid the buffets which are often not fresh and notorious for making visitors ill.<n>There’s an even better view into the caldera, and no fuss, from the road a short way east from Penelokan (heading towards Suter and Rendang, the turnoff for Besakih).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
West of Denpasar<n>Fertile land and high rainfall have brought prosperity to this part of Bali, without the debatable benefits of tourism. In the main towns, you’ll find more computer suppliers than souvenir shops. There is very little in the way of accommodations and not much choice when it comes to eating, but the region is rewarding to explore.<n>Mengwi<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
North of Senggigi, the road is like one big giddy roller-coaster that passes some of the lovliest coastline in the Indonesian archipelago. At times it climbs to the cliff tops, and then swoops down into bays. Tiny fishing villages hide among the palm trees and the sea is flecked with bright lateen sails of prahus out after tuna and snapper.<n>Instead of the coast road, tours from Senggigi and traffic from Mataram sometimes take the inland route via the Pasuk Pass. The two ways meet at Pemenang, where a side road leads to a harbor at Bangsal, the starting point for trips to the Gilis. (Visitors often call them the Gili Islands, but gili means “island.”) Gili Air is nearest, about 3 km (2 miles) away. Next comes Gili Meno and then Gili Trawangan, the farthest out at 8 km (5 miles), and the biggest, although it’s only 21⁄2 km (11⁄2 miles) long.<n>The Gilis are known for their tranquility, surrounded by sparkling waters. Snorkeling, diving, and sunning are the islands’ chief activities. The boats that ply the route from Bangsal to the islands wait for a full load of 15 to 20 people. In July and August that won’t take long, but out of season you can face a delay unless you pay for the empty places or charter a whole boat (fares are low and fixed).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
The city also subsidizes concerts, from rock to classical, in the Plaça de Catalunya and neighborhood parks. One of the best events put on in the city is Grec, an annual festival of international dance, music, and theater. From the last week of June to the end of the first week in August the cultural calendar is full of everything from American blues to Brazilian samba and avant-garde Belgian dance (for a schedule of events and ticket information: Tel. 93/301 77 75; <www .grecbcn.com>).<n>Barcelona is hardly Madrid or Seville when it comes to tablaos—live flamenco performances, though a few shows target the tourist trade: Tablao Flamenco Cordobés (Las Ramblas, 35; Tel. 93/317 66 53) is the most popular and predictable, while El Patio Andaluz (Aribau, 242; Tel 93/209 33 78) also puts on sevillanas, more traditional southern-style singing and dancing. There are also flamenco shows twice nightly, except Monday, at El Tablao de Carmen in the Poble Espanyol on Montjuïc (Arcos, 9; tel. 93/325 68 95).<n>For one-stop partying among those interested more in convenience than quality, the Poble Espanyol features jazz clubs, flamenco performances, big-bands, theater, bars, and discos going strong until 4am.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt
Sant Sadurní d’ Anoia (Penedès)<n>Cava, Catalonia’s sparkling wine, comes from Penedès, a pretty spot 40 km (25 miles) from Barcelona with about four dozen wineries. The French can’t be too happy about it, but the top-selling sparkling wine (a.k.a. champagne) in the world is a Catalan cava: Cordoniu and Freixenet. The main town in the grape-growing region is Sant Sadurní d’ Anoia, where several top wineries are located and offer guided tours and tastings.<n>The most interesting is Codorniu, Spain’s largest producer of cava. The visit to the family-owned winery is located on a spectacular campus, with buildings by Gaudí contemporary Puig i Cadafalch. Completed in 1898, Codorniu has been declared a National Artistic and Historic Monument. Besides the modernista architecture, visitors embark on a fun theme-park-like cart ride through 253/4 km (16 miles) of atmospheric underground cellars.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
Inside the park’s north gate is an even larger complex, the Temple of the Azure Clouds (Biyun Si), which ascends the hillside. The body of Sun Yat-sen, founder of the modern Chinese Republic, once lay in state here before removal to Nanjing; his hat, coat, and coffin are still at this temple. So, too, is the fascinating Luohan Hall. Luohans are followers of Buddha who achieve enlightenment but choose to stay on Earth to show others the way. The 500 luohans portrayed in this temple’s carved figures range from the ecstatic to the gruesome, from the common to the surreal. Topping the temple is the Diamond Throne Pagoda (Jinggang Baozuo Ta), built in 1748 in the Indian style, with four pagodas and two stupas surrounding a 35-m (115-ft) white pagoda.<n>The most popular site in the Western Hills is natural: a summit known as Incense Burner Peak (Xiang Lu Feng), named for the image created when fog comes sweeping over it. There is a winding path to the top known as Gui Jian Chou (“Even the Devil is Terrified”) as well as a chair lift (20 minutes each way). At the 557-m (1,827-ft) summit there are pavilions, vendors, and small paths into surrounding forests. There are also fine views of the lakes, temples, pavilions, and pagodas below, which can be explored upon return. On a clear day, one is tempted to linger. Here, there’s an emperor’s view to the southeast, commanding both the pavilions of the Summer Palace and the skyscrapers of downtown Beijing.<n>White Cloud Temple<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt
Theater<n>When it comes to theater, Berlin is one of the most exciting and innovative cities in Europe and all the world, so that even without a great command of the German language, any enthusiastic theatergoer can enjoy some stirring performances.<n>In Germany major theaters often maintain several productions in repertory, so that in any one week you will be able to see the same troupe perform contemporary or classical drama. There are over 150 theaters in the city, so there’s a vast range to choose from.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhatToDo.txt
The Zoo, entrance on Budapester Straße, has one of the most varied collections of animals in Europe. Beyond the colorful and pagoda-arched Elefantentor (Elephant Gate) are 35 hectares (86 acres) of parkland where you will be able to observe Indian and African elephants, giant pandas from China, and the rare single-horned rhinoceros from India.<n>Sooner or later, everybody comes to promenade along the Ku’damm, and a suitable vantage point from which to survey them is Café Kranzler, a Berlin institution at the corner of Joachimstaler Straße. It’s now decidedly bourgeois, although the original Kranzler at the west end of Unter den Linden between Friedrichstraße and the Brandenburg Gate was a hotbed of radical intellectuals in 1848.<n>The avenue lost almost all the Jugendstil architecture of its Wilhelminian heyday during World War II, but a vestige can be seen in the elegant Café Möhring just across the road. Otherwise the street is resolutely modern — gleaming glass, steel, and an occasional touch of marble — but still a magnet for fashionable shopping.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
Musikinstrumentenmuseum<n>Among the museum’s many historical musical instruments are a 1703 Stradivarius violin, the 1810 piano of composer Carl Maria von Weber, and a 1929 New York Wurlitzer cinema organ, which comes alive in a concert given at noon the first Saturday of every month. Tours are conducted every Saturday at 11am.<n>Neue Nationalgalerie<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
Pergamonmuseum<n>The home of many impressive works of classical antiquity, the Near East, Islam, and the Orient, the museum is named after its most prized possession: the gigantic Pergamon Altar (2nd century b.c.). This masterpiece of Hellenistic art comes from what is now Bergama, near the west coast of Turkey. The massive colonnaded altar, which is dedicated to Zeus and Athena, has been constructed to fill one hall of the museum.<n>The Babylonian Processional Street (604–562 b.c.), built by King Nebuchadnezzar II, is equally impressive. Lions sculpted in relief stride along the street’s blue-and- ochre tiled walls towards the Ishtar Gate. The gate itself is decorated with bulls and dragons, also in blue-and-ochre tile.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
Front Street runs along the water and is the first part of town seen by cruise passengers as ships come to shore. It is the life and soul of Hamilton and a focus for many activities, especially during the summer months. A long row of pastel-painted buildings offer the best in tax-free shopping: jewelry, liquor, clothing, and crystal. Explore the narrow alleyways that lead off Front Street to discover small shops selling collectibles or locally designed arts and crafts, or small restaurants offering local seafood. On Front Street itself there are a number of restaurants with verandas on the first floor, where you can have a drink or meal and watch the world go by. At the west end of Front Street, on the waterfront, you will find the Visitor Service Bureau and the terminal for the local ferries that ply across Great and Little Sound from Hamilton to the southern and western parts of Bermuda.<n>On summer evenings, Front Street comes alive with Harbour Night. Street performers, craft stalls, and late-night shopping are all part of the festivities. There is also the Beat Retreat Ceremony, where the Band and Corps of Drums of the Bermuda Regiment and the Bermuda Islands Pipe Band, in full military dress, march the street to recreate a centuries-old ceremony.<n>Most of Hamilton’s attractions can be seen on foot and would make an enjoyable day’s stroll. But there is also the option of taking a carriage ride through the streets — there’s nothing more romantic than a horse-drawn carriage taking a stately route. Carriages can be hired on Front Street during the summer season.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
On foot, your tour might begin at the head office of the Bank of Bermuda, which is on Front Street behind the Ferry Terminal. This is one of the few “high-rise” buildings in Hamilton, as most of the town’s structures are less than three stories in height. The formal façade has a number of heraldic plaques signifying its ancient pedigree. Inside, the bank keeps a collection of rare and valuable coins dating back through Bermuda’s history. Every type of coin minted by the British crown can be found here, from the time of James I in 1603 (when the charter was granted that brought Bermuda’s first settlers) to the present day, including an example of “Hog” money. Be sure to see the 1887 £5 coin, which caused consternation among British subjects of the time. Because the crown pictured on Queen Victoria’s head was far too small, many people thought that the Queen (and, by extension, the empire) looked ridiculous.<n>From the bank, head for Queen Street, which leads north from the Birdcage, a metal cage once used by police officers to direct the traffic that regularly comes to a halt on Front Street. It was designed by a Mr. Bird, although it also has a resemblance to “Tweetie Bird’s” cage. Traffic lights now regulate the junction. Remember to look right as you prepare to cross the road!<n>On the left as you walk up Queen Street is Perot Post Office, named after the man who was appointed Bermuda’s first Postmaster General in 1821. He had actually been acting as “unofficial” postman for several years, meeting the ships and putting the letters under his hat before touring the town to deliver them. William B. Perot (pronounced “Pea-rut”) went one stage further in 1848 when he began to produce his own postage stamps; only 11 are known to exist today, making each one extremely valuable. The little Post Office is very much as Perot kept it, neat and simply furnished. The building still houses an active post office, which makes it an appropriate place to buy the stamps for your postcards. Bermudian stamps always have a colorful and interesting design; perhaps you can start a collection by buying a set for yourself.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
Mid Ocean Golf Course and Castle Harbour Golf Course straddle the roads here, their verdant greens and fairways tumbling across the undulating land, separated by small casuarina copses. (Be mindful of the state of play as you pass across the fairways here: there is a danger from flying or wayward balls!) The Mid Ocean Club is still a private members’ club with a long pedigree. It has played host to many important political summits since the end of World War II, including the “Big Three” Conference in 1953 attended by Winston Churchill, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Joseph Laniel, the French prime minister.<n>South Road comes to an abrupt end at Tucker’s Town Bay, a small jetty and inlet with yachts bobbing gently in the water. To get across Castle Harbour to St. George’s, you must go north here, taking Paynter’s Road to Harrington Sound. Then drive up along Harrington Sound Road to reach the Causeway to St. George’s.<n>On your way up Harrington Sound Road, you will come to Lemington Caves, a series of caves smaller than Crystal Caves but equally spectacular. Watch also for Walsingham Lane and a sign to Tom Moore’s Tavern, named after the Irish poet who spent some time on Bermuda. The tavern (which is in fact a restaurant with French and local cuisine) is open only in the evening. In the daytime you can visit Idwal Hughes Nature Reserve, also along Walsingham Lane — a pristine area of natural habitat. Collapsed limestone caves and tidal seawater mangrove swamps provide a perfect home for herons, tropical frogs, and many species of fish.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
This area bordering the eastern side of the common is filled with historical imprints and some of the city’s major architectural highlights, which are great when viewed from the harbor (see page 43).<n>Park Street Church stands on a site whose nickname comes from Brimstone Corner (some say for the fiery sermons delivered by such figures as Henry Ward Beecher and William Lloyd Garrison, who delivered his first anti-slavery speech here in 1829, others because gunpowder was kept in the basement during the 1812 War). Built on the site of a granary in 1809, this Georgian church’s most beautiful feature is the 217-ft- (66-m-) tall triple-tiered steeple, based on a Christopher Wren design.<n>The adjacent Granary Burying Ground contains the graves of many heroes: John Hancock, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, James Otis, the victims of the Boston Massacre, Robert Treat Paine (the prosecutor at the Boston Massacre trial), and Peter Faneuil. A map near the entrance locates the gravestones of the famous. Note the many headstones carved with skull and crossbones or winged death’s head motifs. Over the years headstones have been moved to accommodate newcomers and the lawnmower, so they may not mark accurately where the remains lie; furthermore, a couple of dozen bodies may be interred under each stone given that 2,300 bodies are buried here.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
The first leader of the Magyars, Prince Arpád, founded a dynasty that lasted more than three centuries and introduced statehood to the new land. Prince Géza, his great-grandson, embraced Christianity, and on the legendary date of Christmas Day a.d. 1000, Géza’s son, Steven (István), later St. Stephen (Szent István), was crowned the first king of Hungary in the city of Esztergom, situated on the Danube Bend.<n>The ﬁrst record of Pest, meaning “lime furnace” or “ovens” in Slavic, comes from 1061. A landmark of the nation’s civilization in these early days, the Golden Bull of 1222 was a sort of “Magyar Carta” spelling out the rights of nobles and commoners alike. But the rights of man were the last thing on the minds of the Mongols, who overran the country in 1241 and again in 1242. Whole towns and villages, including Buda and Pest, were subjected to an orgy of killing and destruction. The Mongols did not stay, however, nor did they return. King Béla IV then set about reviving the wrecked nation, and founded the town of Buda, wisely building it within fortified walls.<n>The Angevin Dynasty<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-History.txt
Down at the base of the hill, the Gellért Hotel is the perfect place to recover from your walk. Behind this classic 1918 white Art Nouveau structure is a swimming pool complex and the ﬁnest thermal bath in Buda. While the older family members may wish to enjoy the restorative thermal waters and float at leisure in the beautiful indoor pool, youngsters will most likely delight in the equally splendid landscaped outdoor pool.<n>There are some more baths (fürdo) with a wonderful atmosphere in which to relax just along the Buda embankment (rakpart) by the entrance to the Erzsébet híd (Elizabeth Bridge). The thermal pools are restricted to men, only. The entrance to the Rudas fürdo is rather shabby, and a knowledge of the language is deﬁnitely an advantage here, but after 400 years of serving the locals, change comes slowly. The building has been much altered over the centuries but the atmosphere in the steamy main pool, where a stone Turkish dome rises over an octagonal pool and sunbeams stream in through the star-shaped glass openings in the cupola, is magically ancient.<n>The medicinal theme continues a little farther north at the Semmelweis Museum of the History of Medicine (Semmelweis Orvostörténeti Múzeum). Professor Semmelweis, who was born here in 1815, discovered the cause of puerperal fever and thus became known as the “Saviour of Mothers.” The museum is a lively, sometimes gruesome, trawl through old instruments and techniques, some of which appear far worse than the condition they were intended to relieve. There is also a beautifully preserved old pharmacy shop dating back to 1813.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
Scuba diving. There is marvelous scuba diving among the kelp forests of the coastline. Some of the best centers are Monterey, Santa Barbara, La Jolla, and San Diego (Mission Bay Jetty), all of which offer equipment rental and instruction.<n>Sailing. When it comes to sailing, San Diego is the place to go. Every kind of vessel, from the smallest rowboat to the largest ocean-going yacht, is seen in the marinas of Mission Bay and around Shelter Island and Harbor Island in San Diego Bay. The sheltered waters of Mission Bay are an ideal nursery for learning the basics of boat handling, while for the more experienced and adventurous sailors the wide Pacific waits outside. Sailing instruction and boat rentals — rowboats and power boats, sailing dinghies, and yachts — are all available at Mission Bay, San Diego; Marina del Rey, Los Angeles; in Santa Barbara; and in Sausalito.<n>Fishing. Sea angling can be enjoyed from the rocks and piers along the coastline, while deep-sea fishing is available from the sailing harbors listed above.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhatToDo.txt
From the Parc de l’Esplanade, drive up the Côte de la Citadelle hill road and through a tunnel for a guided tour around a powerful bastion of fears long gone. The French built the starshaped Citadel in 1750 to resist the British. The British enlarged it in 1820 to defend Québec City against the Americans, but their cannons never fired a shot in anger. The garrison was British-manned for only 20 years before being handed over to Canadian troops. Today it is the home of Canada’s crack Royal 22nd Regiment.<n>In summertime the garrison comes to life with the Changing of the Guard (10am daily, June 24–first week of Sept.) and Beating the Retreat (6pm Wed–Sat during July and August). The old powder house serves now as the Musée Militaire, displaying the regiment’s history with its trophies, weapons, and uniforms.<n>Running southwest from the Parc de l’Esplanade, the broad, modern Grande-Allée runs past the Assemblée Nationale (provincial parliament), built from 1877–1886 in the favored style of the time, French Renaissance. This has been the citadel of Québec’s quest for a special identity in or outside the Canadian Confederation, especially under Prime Minister René Lévesque.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
St. John’s<n>Local folklore insists that the name (not to be confused with Saint John, New Brunswick) comes from the saint’s day of John the Baptist, June 24, when John Cabot arrived here in 1497.<n>Newfoundland’s capital and largest city retains the simple allure of the fishing port it has always been, and the picturesque harbor is the place to begin. In the 19th century the town burned down five times, but it still stubbornly builds wooden houses overlooking the waterfront. Their brightly painted walls add a welcome touch of color to the gaunt grey trawlers in the docks — from Britain, of course, but also Russia and even Japan. Parallel to the harbor, you’ll find on Gower Street the prettiest Victorian houses, painted burgundy, lemon, burnt sienna, dove grey, and white.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
THE ROCKIES AND PRAIRIES<n>In this region, the great Canadian outdoors really comes into its own. The national parks of the Rocky Mountains provide unrivaled opportunities for exhilarating contacts with a wilderness where you can really escape from your fellow man: camping and hiking through the forests; fishing in the myriad lakes and rivers; canoeing and whitewater rafting in the mountain torrents. And skiing, downhill and cross-country, has been greatly enhanced by the ultra-modern facilities installed for Calgary’s 1988 Winter Olympics.<n>Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba form the Prairie Provinces, sharing the same rugged climate. The full meaning of Canada’s “wide open spaces” becomes instantly apparent here, in the vast stretches of wheat field reaching to the horizon. The eye is attracted not by some craggy obstacle but by the play of a sudden wind sweeping across the plain. The sky is spectacular, offering magnificent dawns and sunsets. Play the farmers’ game of watching the weather come and go.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The Rest of the Island<n>From Valverde follow the road to Isora, a neat little village of well-tended gardens. There are three miradors to enjoy on the road to El Pinar. The name comes from the pinewood forests that in places make up a gentle rolling landscape of fields and trees reminiscent of northern Europe. As the road descends south the greenery eventually peters out into volcanic badlands, and at the tip of the island is the fishing port of La Restinga.<n>The switchback road down to Frontera passes fertile cultivated fields and the occasional disused lagar (winepress). The bell tower of the church here is something of an oddity, being divorced from its body and set on top of a small hill next to it. From a distance the tiny tower set against the massive cliff side seems terribly remote, but as you approach it the illusion disappears and the main road passes within feet of the church and tower. The cliffs here, and all along the stretch of north coast known as El Golfo, were once actually part of an immense volcanic crater. However, some 50,000 years ago one side of it slid, violently, into the sea, leaving behind a gigantic bay with a semi-circumference of 25 km (15.5 miles) and cliffs of up to 1,000 m (3,280 ft). Although the last eruption on the island was over 200 years ago El Hierro, actually, has the highest density of volcanoes in the archipelago. There are over 500 cones on the surface, with an additional 300 covered by lava flows.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
A few miles north of La Santa, home to the Club La Santa a time-share development resort where athletes of the highest level come for both training and relaxation, is the tiny village of Caleta de Famara. It has windswept beaches with views of the daunting cliffs of the Famara Massif that lead up to the Mirador del Río and Graciosa island. There is not much to do along this coastline except sunbathe and windsurf, but as the currents can be dangerous here, be sure to take care.<n>Teguise is a fine old town of cobbled streets and gracious mansions and was the island capital until 1852. Now it is calm and quiet for six days of the week. On Sundays a handicrafts market comes to town where you can buy a timple — a small ukulele-like instrument used by local folkloric musicians. Several of its old buildings have been converted to craft and antique shops and restaurants. Overlooking the town is the 16th-century Castillo de Santa Bárbara. The views from this wind-blown point are worth the trip alone. High on top of the extinct volcano of Guanapay, the castle now hosts the Museo del Emigrante Canario, where sepia photos and nostalgic exhibits tell the sad story of how mass emigration to South America was the only option left for many Canarian families.<n>Costa Teguise, just north of Arrecife, is a totally modern resort, comprising several urbanizaciónes with time-shares, hotels, and apartments designed for a wealthy clientele. It is no surprise to realize that the King and Queen of Spain have an official residence here, and it is where they welcomed the New Milennium. There is a handful of good sandy beaches, particularly Playa de las Cucharas, where water sports thrive and windsurfing is particularly popular. Look for the championship golf course and the Ocean Park Water Park.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
There are two routes south to Puerto del Rosario, the capital. FV-1 follows the east coast of the island, and just a few minutes from the center of Corralejo there are some magnificent, long white beaches and dunes stretching for some 30 square km (12 square miles). These, (along with Isla de los Lobos), have been declared a national park and are popular with nudists. The island lies 3 km (2 miles) offshore, and its beaches are even more secluded than those on the “mainland.” The fishing here is outstanding. Glass-bottomed ferry-boats depart regularly from Corralejo. The rest of the route to Puerto del Rosario, once named Puerto Cabras (Port of the Goats) because in the 18th century it was used mainly for the raising of goats, has nothing of interest for tourists and the town itself is a rather drab place.<n>The inland route south to Puerto del Rosario follows the FV-101 and a diversion, west along the FV-109 will bring you first to the Zoo Safari Calderón Hondo. There you can opt for either a half-hour camel trip or a 11⁄2 hour safari to the lunar landscape of the Volcano Calderón Hondo. Next comes the lace-making town of Lajares. And if you really want to get away from it all, continue on to El Cotillo. This tiny fishing village on the east coast also boasts some excellent beaches wonderful for windsurfing, plus a handful of local bars and some basic restaurants. Heading back south from El Cotillo, the FV-10 rejoins the FV-101 at the small town of La Oliva. This is not especially attractive but it does feature two places of interest. Just off the main road stands the Casa de los Coroneles (House of the Colonels). Its name derives from its 18th-century tenants who once ruled the island. The decaying, cream-colored building still exudes a certain haughty, if melancholy, grandeur. By contrast, the nearby Centro de Arte Canario is bright and modern, exhibiting the works of some of the finest living Canarian artists.<n>A little further south, just past Tindaya, the road makes a dog-leg towards Puerto in the east, and if you look very carefully to your right you will see, at the base of one of the mountains, the Monumento a Don Miguel de Unamuno. Unamuno, a writer and vice-chancellor of the famous University of Salamanca, the oldest in Spain, made himself unpopular in 1924 with the dictator of Spain, General Primo de Ribera. His criticisms of the dictator resulted in his being exiled to Fuerteventura. Although he fled to the somewhat more civilized Paris after a few months, he loved to describe the beauty of the islands in his writing. His most famous quote states that the Canaries were “an oasis in the desert of civilization.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
You can visit the site unaccompanied or hire a guide at the entrance; they charge around $30 for a group of up to six people. You will also find a book and gift store, a restaurant, and a museum with finds from the site and a model of the city to help you to get your bearings.<n>As you enter the site (in the new part of the city) the huge square edifice of El Castillo, also called the Pyramid of Kukulkán, comes into view on your right. The pyramid, 30 m (100 ft) high and the main time-keeping mechanism of the city, was built very precisely in position, shape, and height in order to predict the planting and harvesting cycles. There are 364 steps in four staircases, which together represent the 365 days of the year. There are 52 panels on each side, which echo the 52-year cycle of the Mayan calendar, and terraces that parallel the main staircase, representing the 18-month solar cycle. The best time to see this super-sized timepiece in action is at the Spring Equinox (21 March) or Fall Equinox (21 September) in the afternoon, when the sun’s rays fall down the northern stairway and hit the serpent head at the base. With the play of light and shadow, the serpent appears to wriggle down into the earth. For the Maya, this signified the re-fertilization of the land — and time to plant the corn. The light then leaves the snake head first and travels back up from the base; the Maya believed that the power of the sun was returning to the realm of the gods in the sky.<n>It is possible to climb one of the steep staircases to the upper platform, which has a number of small chambers. The view from the platform is spectacular; look down on other buildings on the site and also out to the distance, with low Yucatecan jungle stretching as far as the eye can see. Take care when you descend the staircase, as the treads are narrow.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
The largest city on the Yucatán peninsula and capital of Yucatán state, La Blanca Mérida was founded in the 1640s, at the very start of the Spanish occupation, on the site of a large Mayan city, T’Ho. Mérida became the focus of influence for the Montejo family, who exerted their force over the surrounding countryside. Since that time, it has seen the ebb and flow of economic prosperity and political power, yet its architecture and lifestyle — a total contrast to modern Cancún — make it a fascinating place to visit. Mérida is a vibrant, bustling city with a tangible energy. It also has interesting attractions that can fill a few days of your itinerary.<n>The heart of the city is Plaza Major (also known by a variety of names such as Plaza des Armas, Plaza Principal, Plaza de la Independencia, and Plaza de la Revolucion). Its tree-lined center has shaded seats where everyone comes to meet and talk; shoe-shine boys work throughout the day, while ice-cream sellers stand on street corners with their small barrows. Look out for the confidenciales, or love seats, where courting couples could sit next to each other without compromising the woman’s reputation. In the center of the square is a flagpole supporting a Mexican flag, which is raised and lowered at the start and end of each day (6am and 6pm) in an elaborate ceremony undertaken by the local police band. Numerous historic buildings, dating back to the very earliest days of Spanish rule, line the square and its surrounding grid of streets. Construction of many of these buildings used stones from the Mayan city of T’Ho, so, alas, nothing remains of this site.<n>Perhaps the most important building is Palacio de Montejo, on the south side of the square. It was built as a family home for the Montejo dynasty and was completed in 1549. The façade — now the only original element of the house — is decorated with a number of ornate carvings, including two large conquistadors seen treading on the heads of Mayan Indians. Perhaps this decoration was added to reaffirm Montejo power in the region. Major renovations to the façade were completed in late 1999. The style of the house is pure Spanish-colonial, with an inner courtyard garden lined by rooms with high ceilings and huge wooden doors. The house was in the Montejo family until the 1970s but then passed into the hands of a bank, which now operates a regional office, ATM, and currency exchange in the interior. Visitors can wander into the courtyard, but many of the architectural treasures are off-limits.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
The Forbidden City, so described because it was off-limits to ordinary people for nearly 500 years, is now called the Palace Museum. Designed to contain the auspicious number of 9,999 rooms, its scale is overwhelming and leaves many visitors bewildered. Built in the years 1406–1420, it was the residence of 24 emperors for nearly seven centuries.<n>Tourists normally enter the Forbidden City from the south, after a long walk along a cobbled roadway from the Gate of Heavenly Peace. The main entrance to the compound, Meridian Gate (Wumen), was designed in the 15th century. Officials used the left portal, members of the imperial family the right. Next comes another ceremonial gate, the Gate of Supreme Harmony (Taihemen), first erected in 1420. A pair of monumental bronze lions stand guard.<n>Beyond this powerful defense line stands China’s supreme ensemble of ancient architecture. First and foremost is the Hall of Great Harmony (Taihedian), popularly called the “Hall of the Imperial Throne.” This is the biggest building in the Forbidden City and one of China’s most beautiful wooden structures. For hundreds of years during the Ming and Qing dynasties this was the tallest building in all Beijing; by law no house could rise higher. (Counting the hall’s upswept roof decorations, that meant the limit was approximately 371⁄2 m, or 123 ft.) Inside, on a raised platform, the “Son of Heaven” sat on his Dragon Throne surrounded by symbols of longevity and power and cowering acolytes, all covered in a fog of incense. To the tune of gongs and chimes, visitors knelt to kowtow nine times.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
On the way to the Great Wall is the peaceful valley the Ming emperors chose as their burial ground. In 1407 the Emperor Yongle ordered a search for a suitable burial place with auspicious “wind and water” conditions, as well as appropriate grandeur. This site proved so perfect that all but three of the succeeding Ming rulers were entombed in the same valley.<n>The Sacred Way to the Ming Tombs begins at a great marble gateway more than four centuries old. Beyond this is the main gate with three archways; the middle arch was used only once in each reign — for the delivery of the emperor’s remains to his tomb. Then comes the Avenue of the Animals, which is lined with massive statues of real and mythical beasts.<n>The largest tomb (Changling) belonged to Yongle himself. Its Hall of Eminent Favors (Lingendian) is among the largest wooden buildings in China. The 32 gilded pillars supporting the coffered ceiling were fashioned from a huge tree that took more than five years to ship here from southwest China.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Sightseeing<n>Guangzhou can’t claim to compete with Beijing or Xi’an when it comes to sightseeing attractions. But its monuments and parks are well worth visiting, not least for the chance to mingle with the Cantonese people themselves.<n>Yue Xiu Park, near the Trade Fair in the northern part of the city, covers a 93-hectare (230-acre) site. In addition to its pretty gardens, lakes, pavilions, and sports facilities, Guangzhou’s largest park also contains the city’s oldest building, the red “Tower Overlooking the Sea” (Zhenhailou). Actually, “tower” is a misleading description for this building of five stories. Built in 1380, it now houses the municipal museum (Guangzhou Bowuguan). With signs in English and Chinese, the museum is quite interesting and includes artifacts and displays recording the city’s contacts with the West (from Bibles to radios). The top floor of this watchtower museum is now a charming teahouse.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
The climate is subtropical, with an annual rainfall of 190 cm (75 inches), so avoid the rainiest season, from April through July. An additional incentive for visiting in autumn is the sight and fragrance of osmanthus (cassia) blossoms all over town; in fact, the name Guilin means “Cassia Woods.”<n>Tourists are so numerous in the otherwise relaxed shopping district of Guilin that the pedestrian crossings have signs in English as well as Chinese. Another cosmopolitan influence comes from the area’s many minority peoples: Guilin is part of the Guangxi-Zhuang Autonomous Region, which borders Vietnam. The proliferation of so-called Muslim restaurants is explained by the presence here of thousands of people of the traditionally Muslim Zhuang nationality, China’s largest minority group.<n>The geological history of Guilin, the key to the wonder of its moody mountains and caves, goes back several hundred million years. The area was under the sea when an upheaval raised it to the status of terra firma. Later it was flooded, then lifted again in further cataclysmic events. The alternation of sea water and air through the millennia created limestone formations called karst, which eroded into pinnacles, mounds, and peaks that captivate the imagination.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Beyond the village of Yangdi unfolds the uncanny scenery that prompted a Chinese poet more than a thousand years ago to write: “The river is a green silk belt, the mountains emerald hairpins.” Peaks and pinnacles crowd the river, white goats pose on steep mountainsides, and an eagle soars above the cliffs. The river itself flows green and transparent. Credit for this limpid rarity goes not only to the strict antipollution standards to protect the River Li but also to nature itself, which endows the water with a high content of carbonic acid.<n>Mural Hill is so called because the sheer cliff face comprises so many patches of color that it might be a fresco. In the lights and shadows of the cliff, the shapes of nine different horses can be discerned, hence the cliff’s alternate name, “Nine Horse Hill.” Near the end of the voyage, the village of Xinping comes into view on the left bank, surrounded by magical scenery — landmarks with names like Snail Hill, Five Fingers Hill, and Carp Hill.<n>The boat trips end at the county town of Yangshuo, a favorite of poets and painters and a destination in its own right. The distance traversed by river is a mere 83 km (52 miles), but there is no river trip like it. The trip back to Guilin by bus provides yet another facet to the soaring scenery.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
At the summit, where the altitude is 223 m (732 ft), the charmingly named Catch-Cloud Pavilion (Nayunting) provides a 360-degree panorama. The view is worth savoring: the winding river, the tile-roofed cityscape, the green flat farmland, and the surreal hills forever popping up near and far.<n>Closer to the city center is Fuboshan (“Whirlpool Hill”) another natural stone tower with a view as well as other distractions. According to legend, a General Fubo, who passed this way 2,000 years ago, tested his sword in the Sword-Testing Stone, a stalactite formation that comes down to within inches of the ground. Further on, the Thousand Buddha Cliff is carved with several hundred figures dating from the Tang and Song dynasties.<n>The District of the Two Lakes, in the southern part of town, has been made into a delightful public park with gardens, walkways, and pagodas. Originally, Banyan Tree Lake (Ronghu) and Fir Tree Lake (Shahu) were a single expanse, forming part of the moat which protected the city wall. The Song Dynasty-era Green Belt Bridge across the middle created the two lakes.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Huangshan (Hwang Shan)<n>Although “Yellow Mountain” is the literal translation of Huangshan (which is not one mountain but a range of dozens of peaks), yellow is not the color that first comes to mind when describing this romantic site that has been the subject of Chinese poetry and painting for centuries. In reality, green is the color of the stunted pines clinging to purple cliff faces. Pink are the wildflowers, blue the sky, and white the sea of clouds that rolls in beneath the rocky pinnacles.<n>Huangshan is the only region of eastern China’s Anhui Province that appears on major tourist itineraries. Trains and planes link Shanghai with a terminus at the foot of the mountains, where coaches continue the journey. The scenic mountain resort now has hotel facilities, from extremely basic to comfortable. Chinese tourists — and poets — might spend a week or more exploring the mountains, but foreign visitors try to squeeze it all into a day or two.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Turpan’s secret is underground water, utilized today as it has been for thousands of years by a system of interconnecting wells (karez) that relay water from the Heavenly Mountains (Tianshan) underground to the oasis. (If the aqueduct were above ground, the water would almost all be lost through evaporation.) Over the whole region, these tunnels, all dug by hand, stretch for perhaps 3,000 km (more than 1,800 miles), with some singular water tunnels running as far as 40 km (25 miles). Thanks to the wells, Turpan grows cotton, melons, and grapes of great sweetness and renown. And the surrounding desert is kept at bay by bountifully irrigated stands of elm, poplar, and palm trees. The karez is an engineering feat on par with that of the Grand Canal, and an exhibition center at one well site allows visitors to enter several of these hand-dug wells for a close-up view.<n>The climatic conditions of China’s “oven” are nevertheless hostile to humans. In the summer, when the temperature exceeds 40°C (104°F) for days at a time, the locals take refuge in cellars until the night breeze comes up. In the springtime, when the mercury is merely in the 30s (close to 90°F), the people dress for a chill — the men in their long underwear and the women in thick brown stockings and gaily colored headscarves.<n>Turpan is about 200 km (125 miles) southeast of Urumqi, the regional capital. It’s so dry and (except for winter) hot in the oasis that tourists are advised to drink as much tea or juice as possible to forestall dehydration. Laundry on the line dries in a matter of minutes rather than hours or days.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Each phase of the fight is closely controlled by the presidente, from his flag-draped box. He drops two handkerchiefs, one to signal the swaggering parade that precedes the fight, and the other to release the first bull from the puerta de toriles, the matador’s “gate of fear,” for the opening act or first tercio. The bull is played with magenta capes — first by the matador’s team, or cuadrilla, then by the matador himself. All the time the torero is assessing the bull, noting his temperament, how he charges, and how he uses his horns.<n>The picador’s moment comes during the second tercio, when he rides into the ring on a horse protected by padding. His task is to lance the bull’s huge shoulder muscles; it’s unattractive but necessary, both to weaken the bull and to lower his head for the kill. Too much lance, and the picador ruins the fight. Too little, and he gives the torero an impossible task.<n>Now banderillas — long, ribboned, steel-tipped darts — are plunged into the bull’s shoulders. In a moment of grace and athleticism, the banderillero, or even the matador himself, runs obliquely across the path of the bull, barely pausing as he jack-knifes over the horns to thrust home the darts.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
The seafood and fish of the Mediterranean provide some of the coast’s most memorable meals. A great favourite is zarzuela de mariscos, a variation of a Catalan dish, which combines many different ingredients, just like the Spanish operetta from which it takes its name. Shellfish is served with rice in an unlikely but very tasty sauce of olive oil, ground almonds, assorted spices, and chocolate, though local cooks sometimes cheat a bit by adding octopus and other shell-less tidbits.<n>Then there is langosta — spiny lobster — as succulent and as expensive as ever, and sometimes priced per 100 grammes (be sure to read the menu’s small print to make sure). Gambas are prawns, and langostinos the jumbo-sized version. Try them a la plancha (grilled), a la romana (fried in batter), or al pil pil in a hot spicy sauce. Emperador (swordfish) is especially good grilled, and lenguado (sole) is delicious in batter, grilled, or sautéed in butter. For something different, try dorada a la sal: a whole fish is packed in wet salt, then baked. It comes to the table in a shiny white jacket that is broken when the fish is cut and served.<n>These seafood dishes tend to be rather expensive, but there are some cheaper options. Try calamares (squid), for instance; they are marvellous deep-fried (a la romana), stuffed (rellenos), or cooked in their own ink (en su tinta). Mejillones (mussels) can be remarkably good steamed with a dash of white wine and garlic. Caballa, the rich-fleshed mackerel, is sometimes available ahumada (smoked).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Tapas<n>A tapa is a mouthful of anything that tastes good and fits on a cocktail stick. The variety is enormous: smoked mountain ham, spicy sausages, cheese, olives (some as big as pigeon’s eggs), sardines, mushrooms, mussels, squid, octopus, meatballs, fried fish, plus sauces and exotic-looking specialities of the house. The name comes from the practice, sadly almost vanished, of providing a free bite with every drink. The tidbit was put on a small plate traditionally used to cover the glass and came to be called a tapa, which means lid.<n>Touring tapas bars is great fun, especially in a town’s old quarter. It can be expensive, certainly more than the cost of an orthodox meal, but do try to devote at least an evening to it. The code is simple: one helping is called a porción; a large serving is a ración; half as much, a media-ración.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Other Sports<n>Golf: When it comes to variety, few resort areas in the world can compare with the Costa del Sol. There are nearly 30 18-hole courses between Málaga and Gibraltar. Most private and hotel clubs welcome non-residents or non-members, though some may charge visitors a higher fee. Clubs, caddies, and carts are generally available for rental.<n>The quality of the courses is excellent — many have been designed by such famous names as Robert Trent Jones and Seve Ballesteros. Las Brisas, near Marbella, has hosted the Spanish Open and Valderrama, near Sotogrande, was host to the 1997 Ryder Cup. Although a private club, Valderrama has nine starting times between midday and 2pm that are open to the public, albeit at 30,000 ptas (a180.3) per round.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhatToDo.txt
Where to Go<n>Most visitors to the Costa del Sol are based in one of the large coastal resorts to the west of Málaga (Torremolinos, Benalmádena, Fuengirola, Marbella or Estepona), while far fewer head east toward Nerja, Almuñécar, or even as far as Almería. Although the main aim for many is to relax on the beach and soak up as much sun as possible, increasing numbers arrive to play golf. It comes as little surprise, therefore, that the road signs proclaim the area west of Málaga not just the Costa del Sol, but the Costa del Golf also.<n>A few visitors forsake the beach for a day or two and venture out to either the amazingly varied historic towns and cities or the natural wonders of the national parks nearby. Málaga, Ronda, and perhaps Gibraltar can be seen in a day, but Sevilla, Córdoba, Granada, and the parks necessitate at least an overnight stop.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Almuñécar is the first town of any size, and has an ancient history. A fine aqueduct stands as a monument to the skills of the Roman engineers who constructed it during the reign of Antoninus Pius in the second century a.d. A port for Granada in Moorish times, Almuñécar continued to enjoy a certain prestige after the Reconquest when Juan de Herrera, the architect of El Escorial, Philip II’s grand monastery cum palace near Madrid, was commissioned to design the parish church. These days the town, set around an attractive curving beach, is an increasingly popular family resort.<n>Along the road from Almuñécar, pretty villas with spectacular coastal views dot the hillsides until, all of a sudden, the scenery changes dramatically. As the coast flattens out, a town of whitewashed houses atop a rocky, cone-shaped hill comes into view. Called Salobreña, it makes for an impressive sight. A Moorish castle, beautifully restored, stands isolated at the heart of the village.<n>Salobreña stands as the gateway to the agriculturally rich vega (plain) of the thriving port city of Motril. Sugarcane, the source of the greenery, flourishes here. The sugar refineries in the area have earned the town its nickname — Little Cuba. Like that country, Motril is known for its rum, although its residents are crafty enough to make just about enough for local consumption, and no more. Motril and Salobreña have their own extensive beaches and there are many more to come as the road continues eastward.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Iráklion<n>Iráklion comes as a surprise to travelers used to Greek islands further north in the Aegean Sea. It is a true city bustling with activity, dust, and noise. The commercial and administrative heart of Crete, its streets are filled with bankers and business people. There is a lively young scene based around the university, and a sophistication to match other major Greek cities such as Athens or Thessalonica. However, this is not the only facet of the city. Around the harbor you’ll still find a fishing industry based on small family-owned boats, and small workshops in the narrow back streets that still manufacture by hand. Though there are many modern buildings, these sit shoulder to shoulder with fine old mansions and are evidence of an older Iráklion, which is fascinating to explore. Take time to see beyond the streets filled with traffic and you will be amply rewarded.<n>Iráklion was a thriving port in Minoan times and became known as Herakleium under Roman rule. The arrival of the Venetians changed the town’s fortune. They chose it as their capital, bestowing the name Candia on both the city and the whole island. Candia blossomed with the riches of Venetian trade, and when Turkish forces stormed the island, the town held out for several months before falling into the Moslem hands. It became a relative backwater of the Ottoman Empire only to rise to prominence again following union with Greece. It was declared capital again in 1971, taking the title from Chaniá in the west.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
The North Coast<n>The Costa Blanca’s reputation for magnificent beaches and lively resorts comes from the northern stretch of coast. Take the N-332 from Alicante and drive through Campello to the fishing port of Villajoyosa. This picturesque village, some 30 km (18 miles) from the provincial capital, is more authentically Spanish in character than Benidorm, its cosmopolitan neighbour.<n>Wind your way towards the sea through the narrow streets of the old town, and suddenly you’ll see a group of housefronts in sun-bleached blues, pinks, and yellows. White-rimmed doors and windows, black wrought-iron grilles, green blinds, and a massive Gothic church give the impression of a sparkling diadem — but then Villajoyosa literally means “Jewelled Town.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
The next stop is Tárbena (10 km/6 miles farther along the C-3318), an invigorating mountain village famed for its delicious sausages. They’re made from a secret recipe handed down to the present-day villagers by their Mallorcan ancestors, who came here in the early 17th century as part of an official repopulation scheme.<n>After Tárbena comes the finest scenery of all: bold, terraced mountains, wide undulating valleys, and scattered farms connected by mule tracks. In spring the countryside is covered with the pink and white of almond blossoms, but the road is for all seasons, with groves of gnarled olive trees alongside it, their leaves blowing silver in the evening light. Follow the road to Coll de Rates, 500 metres (1,500 feet) above the wide orange- and vine-filled plains that sweep up to Jávea, Denia, Gandía, and the deep-blue Mediterranean. Farther on, take the road to Jalon, where in late summer farmers sell muscat grapes to passers-by, and you can buy some of the strong local wine. Or carry on past Orba to Benidoleig and visit the prehistoric caves, Las Calaveras. Here high-domed ceilings drip with stalagtites, and human bones more than 50,000 years old have been found.<n>Six km (31⁄2 miles) more bring you to the Valencia–Alicante highway near Ondara.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
Thousands of pines, palms, and eucalyptus trees, planted to control shifting sand dunes, shade the beaches at Guardamar del Segura (17 km/10 miles south again on the N-332), an important fishing centre. Spiny lobsters are a speciality of Guardamar restaurants. From here, the road travels a further 15 km (9 miles), past the salt flats of La Mata, to Torrevieja.<n>The long-vanished “old tower” from which Torrevieja took its name has been replaced by a new one, built with funds raised by expatriate citizens. The expanding summer resort and its long, sandy beaches co-exist with Europe’s largest and oldest salt industry. The enormous mountain of salt you’ll see comes from the La Mata and Torrevieja pans. Visitors are welcome Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:00 p.m. Request passes from the office of the Nueva Compañía Arrendataria de las Salinas de Torrevieja on the port’s main square. (Photography permits are harder to get.)<n>In August Torrevieja pulsates to the music of the Habaneras festival. The theme is the lively, song form of the same name (remember Bizet’s Carmen?), brought back from Cuba during the 19th-century salt-export voyages. The festivities include musical competitions, concerts, and shows by leading — sometimes international — companies.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
Five km (3 miles) more bring you to thriving Mojácar, a village planted on the eastern extremity of the rugged Sierra Cabrera. Purists complain that the cubist effect of steep hillsides dotted with square, flat-roofed houses has been spoiled by modern development, but the beaches all around are still pleasant.<n>About 3,000 years ago, Mojácar was an important Phoenician port, but earthquakes and major geological upheavals have left it high and dry. For centuries the women of Mojácar were kept behind the veil, and the place is still known as the “Village of the Covered Ones.” (Interestingly, there’s an elegant white statue of a veiled woman outside the church.) Its renown as the “Village of Witches” comes from Mojácar’s long and continuing flirtation with faith healing, spells, and magic brews. This isolated town is the last bastion of the mystical sign of the dalo, a figure holding a rainbow over his head that was believed to be a talisman against the evil eye. (The word comes from an old Iberian term meaning “Lord of All.”) Nowadays, you are more likely to see the Indalo in the form of a lucky charm on sale in souvenir shops rather than painted, as it once was, on house doors.<n>The narrow coastal road continues another 22 km (19 miles) weaving through a moody landscape of barren mountains to Carboneras. The long, sandy beaches here are another favourite spot for camping excursions.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
There are basically three styles of trekking. You can book through a private agency that will plan your itinerary and provide everything: from down jackets, sleeping bags, and food and drink to sirdar (guide), cook, and porters who will set up the tents at campsites. Alternatively, you can hire a guide and/or porter and do a lodge-to-lodge trek, which involves very little planning and allows you to do your hiking with only a light day-pack on your back. The last — and cheapest — alternative is to carry your own pack and strike out with a good trekking guidebook but no Nepali guide or porter. Most people who opt for this latter type of trek stay in the numerous and increasingly more comfortable trailside lodges that can be found on the major trekking routes. By staying in lodges, you avoid having to carry a tent, food, or cooking gear. A luxury trek in the first category might cost $100 or more per day per person. Hiring a guide and porter will lower your daily costs to somewhere around $20 or $25, while going it alone (meaning without a guide, as trekking without any companion should not be attempted) can be done for less than $10 a day.<n>October and November are the most popular trekking months because they are warm and sunny, and the trails are dry after the monsoon. December is good for low-level treks, though it will be getting cold at higher altitudes. The winter months bring the clearest skies. Spring comes in March and April, when rhododendrons and other flowers set the forests ablaze with color. In spring the skies gradually become hazy and there are light rains, which can make flights to starting points unpredictable. By May it is hot in Pokhara, the high peaks are rarely visible, and humidity mounts until the weather breaks in June, with the onset of the monsoon. Trails during the monsoon are muddy, slippery, and leech-ridden, which makes trekking between June and October a miserable experience. It is possible to fly to higher elevations where leeches are less of a problem, but the rainclouds make mountain flights particularly dangerous.<n>Deciding where to go will depend on the time available and your physical condition. Serious trekkers usually plan on spending two to three weeks or more on the trail. Five days to a week is about the minimum to have a fair sampling of trekking life (though only after about a week do you get your “trail legs”). Shorter outings around the Kathmandu Valley or the four-day “Royal Trek’’ out of Pokhara (which was followed by Prince Charles) afford great mountain views in season and are not to be disdained.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
One of the few unpleasant aspects of trekking is the prevalence of begging along the trail. In almost every village trekkers enter, they are almost immediately greeted by sometimes very insistent (even belligerent) children shouting out “one pen, one rupee, one sweet.’’ Trekkers are urged not to give in to their insistent demands; this begging is due to trekkers in the past indiscriminately handing out gifts to the local children. Such children often grow up to depend on more sophisticated forms of begging  — when you stop for a glass of tea or a soft drink, you may be asked to make a donation to a local school or bridge-building fund. You’ll be shown a notebook full of the names of previous donors and the amounts they donated. You’ll also likely be asked to perform emergency first aid on local villagers, but aside from putting a bandage and disinfectant on someone’s cut, you may just want to direct the injured and infirm to the nearest health post, unless you have a medical background, can adequately diagnose the problem, and have the appropriate remedy handy.<n>Staying properly hydrated is perhaps the most difficult thing on a trek. Carry a canteen and some iodine or a two-stage water filter (one that iodizes the water), and try to drink at least two quarts (liters) of water a day to avoid dehydration. Alternatively, taking lots of tea breaks and ordering tea by the pot rather than just by the glass will help to keep plenty of liquids in you. Avoid buying the bottled water sold along the trail. The plastic bottles this water comes in have become the most prevalent form of litter along the trails in recent years, and to make things even worse, they are sometimes just refilled from a nearby water tap and resold to unsuspecting trekkers.<n>If you are on an organized trek, carry plenty of small rupee notes in case you want to buy some tea, a Coke, or some other snack or souvenir along the trail. If you are doing a lodge-to-lodge trek, carry plenty of 20, 50, and 100 rupee notes.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
Bisket, the official New Year, prompts a wild celebration in Bhaktapur. Four days before New Year, two groups of men representing different districts of the city have a tug of war over a chariot containing symbols of Kali and Bhairav. The winners keep the chariot in their district and parade it through the streets for the next several days, fuelled by rice liquor. On 14 April, a huge pole, decorated with leaves and garlands and two streamers representing snakes, is erected in a field on the outskirts.<n>Why snakes? Well, it seems that a princess of bygone years required a new lover every night because each morning her partner was found dead. Finally a prince took on the job, and after satisfying the princess he hid himself, sword bared. Two snakes issued from the princess’s nostrils, ready to kill. But the prince hacked them up and lived happily ever after with the princess — no questions asked. Her father, the king, ordered the pole with snake streamers to be erected every year in commemoration. A second tug of war takes place on New Year’s afternoon, when the pole is pulled by opposing teams until it comes crashing down.<n>Indra Jatra is an important festival, usually falling in early September. During this week-long observance, the Kumari is drawn through the streets of Kathmandu on her chariot and receives the homage of the king. Ritual dances are staged in Durbar Square, which is jam-packed at this time, the steps of the Vishnu temple being reserved for women and children decked out in their finest. On the last evening, the screen is removed from the face of the White Bhairav mask and beer squirts from his mouth to the jostling crowd beneath.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
Patan’s big blow-out, in late April, is in honor of the Red Machendra, a god sacred to both Buddhists and Hindus and probably of very ancient origin among valley animists. The festival involves dragging a huge chariot across the city and sometimes takes a month before culminating in the display of a jeweled vest, about which, needless to say, another complicated legend exists. Kathmandu’s White Machendra gets his chariot ride a month earlier.<n>Holi, when a kind of maypole with streamers is put up in Basantapur Chowk next to Kathmandu’s old royal palace and crowds throw colored powders and water bags at each other, comes in March–April, the merriment encouraged by the full moon. Gaijatra, the festival of cows and departed souls, is another light-hearted celebration. Departed souls who hold onto the tails of cows are believed to receive assistance in entering heaven. Boys dressed as cows and clowns dance in the streets, and much alcohol is consumed, especially in Bhaktapur. During a year after the death of a family member, Nepalis wear white in mourning. White candles also are used at the time of death.<n>Trekkers who reach the Thyangboche Monastery above Namche Bazaar on the full-moon day of November will be privileged to see the Buddhist monks’ masked dance ceremony, Mani Rimdu. A similar dance takes place on the May–June full moon. Sherpas celebrate Tibetan New Year in February with singing, dancing, and the consumption of chhang, the local home-brewed rice beer.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
Once the private hunting ground of royalty and their guests, Chitwan became a national park in 1973 and has been designated by Unesco as a World Heritage Site. Royal Chitwan National Park is 932 sq km (358 sq miles) of magnificent first-growth trees — the tall hardwood sal, the kapok “silk-cotton” tree, and the flame-of- the-forest with their spectacular crimson February flowers, plus ferns, bamboo, and huge vines that choke trees to death like pythons. And there are real pythons, too. White-ruffed langur monkeys leap and swing in the treetops, sending flights of green parakeets screeching. In open glades, peacocks preen, and shy, tiny barking deer, no taller than the peacocks, race away at an intruder’s approach. It’s a magical environment.<n>The best way to see the wildlife, and certainly the most fun, is swaying atop a silently padding elephant. The elephant grass along the several rivers in the park is so tall that only from an elephant’s back can you spot rhinos, deer, and other creatures, most of which are used to seeing elephants and do not run from them. With luck, you’ll see a leopard draped indolently on a tree branch, and perhaps a stately sambar stag. In winter, the gaur, the world’s largest wild ox, almost 2 m (6 ft) high at the shoulder, comes out of its hideaway in the Siwalik Hills on the park’s southern edge in search of young grass. Spotted deer, sloth bear, giant flying squirrels, and civet cats are among the other mammals the visitor may see.<n>There are several jungle lodges and tented camps within the park’s boundaries, and from any of these camps there is a very high likelihood that you will see rhinos and deer. Tigers, leopards, and sloth bears are a bit more elusive. All of these lodges, and even some outside the park, have their own elephants and nature guides. On a stay at one of these lodges, a half day is usually spent in dug-out canoes searching for endangered gharials, a narrow jawed fish-eating crocodile, and their flesh-eating cousins, the huge marsh muggers. However, these canoe rides actually focus on the more visible bird life along the river banks — egrets, ducks, storks, kingfishers, eagles, and scores of other fascinating birds. The rare, almost sightless Gangetic dolphin may even come up for a blow alongside your canoe if you are extremely lucky. At day’s end, lodge guests compare notes around the bar. At least one evening during a stay, men from a nearby Tharu village will perform their traditional martial arts-like stick dance.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
Montmartre is really a hilltop village (“La Butte” to its residents), with narrow, winding streets and dead-ends. For the last 200 years it has been associated with artists and bohemians. The Montmartrobus spares you the walk and shows you some of the area in a single tour, but the best way to discover Montmartre at your own pace is to start early, at the top. Take the métro to Abbesses and the elevator to the street (the stairs here are endless) and notice the handsome Art Nouveau entrance as you leave. Rue Yvonne le Tac leads to the base station of a funicular railway. It was here that St. Denis was martyred (see page 13) and where St. Ignatius Loyola launched the Jesuit movement in 1534.<n>The funicular (it takes métro and bus tickets) climbs to the terrace in front of the Byzantine-style basilica of Sacré-Cœur. Standing at the highest point in Paris, it’s one of the city’s principal landmarks, and one of the few to remain perennially controversial. Artists still scorn it as a vulgar pastiche, and the working-class residents of the area resented its being erected as a symbol of penitence for the insurrection of the 1871 Commune — they didn’t feel penitent in the least. The Sacré-Cœur’s conspicuous whiteness comes from the local Château-Landon limestone, which bleaches on contact with carbon dioxide in the air and hardens with age. For many, the best reason for visiting the basilica is the view of the city from the dome or the terrace below.<n>Just a few steps west of Sacré-Cœur is St-Pierre-de-Montmartre, one of the city’s oldest churches. Consecrated in 1147, 16 years before the church of St-Germain-des-Prés (see page 58), it is a significant work of early Gothic, belied by its 18th-century façade. The Sacré-Cœur’s architect, Paul Abadie, wanted to demolish St-Pierre, but he was overruled, and it was restored “as a riposte to the Sacré-Cœur.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
Cork. Portugal is the world’s leading producer of cork. You’ll find place mats, intricate sculptures, and other designs, and it’s as light as a feather to take home.<n>Embroidery. A great many embroidered, items, including tablecloths and napkins, are all over Portugal — especially at street markets. Look for the delicate hand needlework that comes from the island of Madeira — items that are exceedingly well crafted but still comparatively inexpensive.<n>Jewelry. Filigree work, a legacy of the Moors, is of extremely high quality. Look for silver filigree earrings and brooches, often in the form of flowers or butterflies.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhatToDo.txt
Music. To enjoy the sounds of Portugal back home, take home a classic fado recording, perhaps by Amália Rodrigues or Carlos Paredes, or a disc of ethereal Portuguese pop by the Lisbon group Madredeus.<n>Wine. Portugal’s wine industry produces not only excellent table wines from regions like Dão, Douro, and Alentejo, but legendary port wine, which comes from the north. The best places to buy are the cellars maintained by all the major producers in Vila Nova de Gaia just across the river from Porto. Given wine’s weight and bulk, it’s often best to wait until the duty-free shop at the airport.<n>When & Where to Shop<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhatToDo.txt
Access from one part of the Algarve to another is along the EN125 road, which runs most of the length of the coast. The section of coast stretching from Faro eastwards to Spain, known as the Sotavento Coast, is made up of salt marshes and lagoons, with beautiful sandy beaches on the barrier islands just offshore. The most intensively developed part stretches westward from Faro to Portimão. Here the long beaches are all backed by scores of busy, large-scale tourist resorts.<n>The more dramatic Barlavento Coast extends west from Portimão, and is characterized by a twisting shoreline indented with coves and wind-sculpted cliffs. The coast comes to an end at Cabo São Vicente, known to the medieval Portuguese as the End of the World. The west coast of the Algarve is wilder, colder, windier, and considerably emptier, even though it has its fair share of wonderful beaches. Inland you’ll find Roman and Moorish monuments, numerous fruit orchards, and the scenic wooded hillsides of the serras that separate the Algarve from the Alentejo.<n>Barlavento Coast<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
After a walk of about half a mile you’ll find the plain façade of the Museo de Arte e Historia (San Juan Museum of Art and History) on your left. Once a major market place for the city, built in 1855, the building now houses a major collection of Puerto Rican art.<n>Just past the museum, a large, open grassy area comes into view. If you happen to be here on a weekend you’ll find thousands of Puerto Rican families out flying kites. This area is the best place to take advantage of the sea breezes, and many kites soar hundreds of feet up in the air. When collisions occur or lines get crossed, jovial banter breaks out between the parties — it’s a very social activity. The grassy area, cut by one gravel path, leads to the end of the promontory — and the mighty Fuerte San Felipe del Morro, usually simply referred to as “El Morro” (meaning “the headland”). On your right as you walk toward the entrance you’ll pass the old city cemetery resting between the walls and the sea. The ornate tombs are still carefully attended and hold the remains of some of Puerto Rico’s most illustrious families. The entrance to El Morro is reached across a wide dry moat, a last defense against attack. Walk through the huge curved doorway to the heart of the fort.<n>El Morro was one of the most formidable citadels in the world. During the 16th and 17th centuries it was one of a ring of forts that held the key to Spanish power in the Caribbean. The watchtowers of El Morro look out to sea and inland across San Juan Bay to the coastal plains beyond. The multilevel defenses made it possible to fire weapons from sea level up to hundreds of feet above ground. Despite some serious attempts by English and Dutch forces, the fort was never forcibly taken.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Like most of the Virgin Islands, St. Thomas is full of hills. The roads twist and turn around sharp bends and roll up and over undulations. To see the main attractions of St. Thomas it’s best to head directly north up into the hills; you’ll be able to enjoy the beautiful views back towards Charlotte Amalie along the way. Drake’s Seat, thought to mark the spot where Francis Drake sat and watched ships moving to and from San Juan, offers breathtaking views of the northern coastline and Magens Bay, the site of what is probably the best beach on St. Thomas, and one of the most famous in the Caribbean. Estate St. Peter Greathouse and Botanical Gardens takes up 11 acres (41⁄2 hectares) along the ridge top near the summit of St. Peter peak. The estate was established in the 1800s and was owned in the 1930s by Virgin Islands Governor Lawrence Cramer. Both the house and the gardens were totally destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Today they are back to their beautiful best, and the house has been restored to combine history with modern amenities. The observation deck around the house is the perfect perch from which to admire the view. If you’re feeling more energetic, follow the nature trail through the garden.<n>At nearby Mountain Top — 1,547 ft (472 m) above the bay, and higher than Drake’s Seat — you’ll find a sophisticated shopping mall and large bar area with almost non-stop daiquiris (they claim to have invented the banana daiquiri here). Everyone comes with a camera, so you may have to wait a while to get a shot of the view.<n>Magens Bay is a beautiful stretch of sand with a slight kink in the center, which gives it the epithet “heart-shaped.” Because it is so sheltered, it’s a safe place for children to swim and for everyone to snorkel, though it can get very busy. In the rolling hillside behind the beach is Mahogany Run Golf Course, so you could have a round in the morning and swim and snorkel in the afternoon.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Puerto Vallarta is making a name for itself with its vast selection of live music. One stretch of street — Ignacio L. Vallarta, just across the southbound bridge — is known as Rockin’ Row, for its eclectic collection of clubs. Within easy walking distance from one another, you’ll find a blues club, a Harley-Davidson-theme rock n’ roll club, a salsa dance club, live mariachi music, a glitzy gay club (with nightly leather ranch-hands’ show), an alternative dance club, and a sports bar.<n>Still, the malecón rules when it comes to sheer rowdy nighttime fun. Along with the longstanding Carlos O’Brians, several open-air bars and dance clubs stay open until 5am, and a new Cuban restaurant-bar pleases patrons with authentic food and live music nightly until 3am. Just a few blocks in back of the malecón are a growing collection of unique clubs with a more urban edge. Among them is La Cantina, a hipper version of a Mexican classic. By day it serves classic cantina fare, by night it clamors with the sound of conversation mixed with the best in contemporary recorded Mexican music. Board games are available for play.<n>Marina Vallarta is quieter at night, with the lighthouse-top lounge, El Faro, a favorite for spending a romantic evening, listening to live flamenco guitar. Along the Hotel Zone, the throwback disco Christine still manages to draw a crowd for the nightly midnight laser show, and J&B is a very hot spot for true Latin dancing; a favorite with locals, it’s open until 5am. Also downtown, you’ll find the imported Hard Rock Café, Planet Hollywood, and Hooters, but they tend to draw lesser crowds than the locally-owned options.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt
Manzanillo, Ixtapa, and Zihuatanejo offer less in the way of nightlife. Manzanillo’s clubs are few, but crowded, and feature recorded music for dancing. The Latin music clubs get going around 10pm, and don’t even show up before midnight at the techno and alternative clubs. The majority of clubs, and the ubiquitous Carlos ‘n’ Charlie’s, are located along the main boulevard, Miguel de la Madrid. In Ixtapa, sunset happy hours offer the most options, and Mexican fiestas seem to be a “best bet” for a complete evening. Other later night offerings are a sampling of what you’ll find in any resort town in Mexico: Christine’s disco at the Krystal Hotel, Sr. Frogs, and Carlos ‘n’ Charlie’s. The only really original option here is the club, La Valentina, a combination restaurant/video bar with a desert-inspired décor.<n>There is no doubt that Acapulco rules when it comes to nightlife. In fact, I would venture that most visitors here come especially for that. Anyone that believes disco is dead hasn’t been to Acapulco — it’s alive and well, and happens nightly in an array of clubs that get going around midnight and often close after the sun comes up. The most majestic of these, Enigma, Palladium, and Fantasy, are located in the Las Brisas section of town, with towering, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking stunning views of Acapulco Bay in all its night-lit splendor.<n>Along the main Hotel Zone, clubs are closed-in, but still offer sultry-hot music made for dancing; among them are Alebriges, Andromeda, and Baby-O. The Condessa stretch of the Costera is host to a string of open-air beach bars, with the most popular being Disco Beach, El Sombrero, and the pirate-theme Barbaroja. These offer dancing under the stars with a view of the ocean. The crowd here is young — very young — and the general rule is that one cover charge entitles you to all you can drink. Special coupons are handed out aggressively on the beaches during the day, in hopes of luring the biggest crowd that night.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt
Another seasonal, and very worthwhile eco-conscious activity, is to participate in the nightly sea turtle releases and watches that take place from August through November along the shores of Banderas Bay, and further south in Mazunte (located between Huatulco and Puerto Escondido). Preservation groups and trained specialists conduct these releases and watches. You participate by helping to collect the turtles’ eggs and taking them to a safe nesting area for incubation. After the baby turtles hatch, they are released back into the ocean. Organized visits to the turtle camps are conducted daily in Mazunte, at the Centro Mexicano de la Tortuga, and in Puerto Vallarta by several of the beachfront hotels and a select group of ecologically oriented tour operators, such as Eco-tours de México (Tel. (3) 222-6606).<n>When it comes to unforgettable experiences, few compare to the unique feeling of swimming with dolphins, and Mexico has some of the best dolphin centers in the world. Dolphin Adventure in Puerto Vallarta is considered the best in Latin America, both for its exceptional treatment of these mammals as well as its affiliated research and environmental education programs. This interactive dolphin center offers a free-form swim with the dolphins, with a strictly limited number of participants, as well as a “Dolphin Encounter,” where they learn about these mammals in an up-close and personal manner. Acapulco has two dolphin centers, CICI (Centro Internacional de Convivencia Infantil) located across from the Convention Center, and at Paradise on La Condesa beach. These centers are more for show and entertainment than for true research and education. Prices for these dolphin experiences vary between US$65 and US$160.<n>Guided Tours<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt
Best Buys<n>Ceramics. Both Talavera ceramics from Puebla, and majolica ceramics are found in the region — but don’t mistake one for the other. Both have the same style, using bright colors like yellow, burnt orange, and royal blue, or a blue and off-white scheme, in designs that include flowers, birds and geometric shapes. The only way that you can tell them apart is by looking on the back of the piece and checking for the mark and the signature of the maker — only ceramics that have been handcrafted in Talavera, Puebla can be called “Talavera.” All other ceramics with the same technique and design are known as “majolica.” Because Talavera comes from a very specific region and only a few workshops produce this type of ceramic, it is more expensive than majolica, even though majolica can be just as beautiful.<n>Leather goods. Jalisco is especially noted for its tooled leather goods, an art stemming from the traditions of the charros (Mexican ranchers, highly skilled in the roping and handling of horses), dating back to the days of the haciendas. No self-respecting charro would be caught without his cinturón piteado, a tooled leather belt, decorated with piteado, a type of fine work where thin threads are sewn into the leather forming beautiful flower or geometric patterns that may even include the owner’s name. This same workmanship may be appreciated in authentic charro boots and fine saddles. The finer the thread, and the more complex the pattern, the more expensive the piece.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt
