odel for Replenishable Products Although determining an inventory policy for nonreplenishable products continues to be an issue for retailers, inventory decisions that involve replenishables have undergone the most change with the advent of lean retailing. [SEP] Indeed, many products sold in retail outlets, particularly basic and fashion-basic items, can now be replenished after the start of the selling season. [SEP] The jagged heavy line in Figure 6.5 (page 100) depicts a typical inventory pattern for a replenishable product like our blue jeans in size 8. [SEP] Note that the inventory level drops gradually as consumers purchase the item. [SEP] Once a week, this retailer places a replenishment order with its supplier and receives a shipment. [SEP] On July 17 and 24, the replenishment order	arrives	in time to restock the inventory before selling out; however, during the week of July 24, high demand led to rapid depletion of stock, so the retailer stocks out of the product prior to the end of the week. [SEP] To understand this product’s inventory requirements, it helps to divide the inventory into two separate components: cycle stock, which is held to cover expected demand for the product; and safety stock, which is held to cover higher than expected demand. [SEP] Figure 6.5 breaks out these two components of stock. [SEP] The straight dashed lines show the inventory pattern that would result if there were no variation in demand—that is, if exactly the same number of units were bought each day. [SEP] Specifically, the dashed lines indicate the inventory pattern that would result if dema	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch6.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	4
l, which, however, hits a paddle on a sturdy paddle wheel I constructed. [SEP] Once struck by the cannonball, the paddle wheel is set to spinning. [SEP] Prior to my firing the cannonball, I contrived to tie one end of a red rope around the axle of the paddle wheel and a modest size bucket to the other end of the rope. [SEP] Thereafter, I dropped the bucket down the well. [SEP] The water-filled bucket has now rested, silent and waiting, until the cannonball strikes the paddle wheel, whereupon the wheel spins, the red rope winds up, pulling the water-filled bucket up the well, up against the axle, which tilts the bucket over  you will have to imagine this part  and pours the water into a long funnel that slopes down from the wellhead toward my bean field. [SEP] When the water from the bucket	arrives	at the bottom of the water pipe, it pushes against a flap valve, thereby opening the valve and watering my bean field. [SEP] You can see why I might be proud of my machine. [SEP] What is the dierence between .a and .b? [SEP] The point of the cannon and cannonball in the two figures is to emphasize that there is the same total input of energy into the two cases. [SEP] The explosion of gunpowder is evidently the same, as is the flight of the cannonball. [SEP] Obviously, in Figure .a, most of the energy carried by the cannonball is dissipated as heat, random molecular motions induced in the particles of dirt. [SEP] Indeed, I might have sent the cannonball bouncing along a large steel plate rather than hitting mere dirt. [SEP] In the case of the plate, no hole would have formed, and hot steel w	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	4

The North Coast Before the days of flying, most visitors to Bali arrived in the north. [SEP] The first Dutch military expeditions disembarked near Singaraja, which became the island’s administrative capital and the colony’s chief port. [SEP] Now, almost everyone	arrives	and stays in southern Bali, and only a fraction of them ever take a trip to the north coast, although the journey takes less than two hours by road. [SEP] There is quite a contrast between the south and north. [SEP] It is hotter and drier in the north and far less densely populated. [SEP] The proportion of Muslims is higher; some of the people are descended from traders and immigrants from other islands. [SEP] There is only a narrow strip of flat land between the mountains and the sea, or in some places none at all. [SEP] Cactus plants are as common as palm trees and the small area of rice depends on irrigation. [SEP] The region is also dotted with Bali’s local vineyards.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	4
Save your bargaining for the gypsies and antique dealers, but remember that they have been at it a long time. [SEP] Beware of rebajas (sales); they may be genuine, but reductions are generally few and far between, especially in season. [SEP] The Spanish government levies a value-added tax (called IVA) on most items. [SEP] Tourists from overseas can get a refund on the IVA they’ve paid on purchases over a stipulated amount. [SEP] Major tourist shops have forms and details. [SEP] The refund eventually	arrives	at your home address. [SEP] Summer shopping hours are generally from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. (During the rest of the year shops open later and close earlier.) The big Alicante and Valencia department stores stay open during the traditional siesta, which is the quietest time to shop. [SEP] In the tourist season, small shops often stay open on a Saturday evening and Sunday morning.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	4
, and these have delightful architectural and lifestyle details to discover. [SEP] Sitía also has a pleasing Archaeological Museum displaying finds from Petrás and Gourniá. [SEP] You’ll find it just south of the town center. [SEP] Sitía is the gateway to the far east of Crete. [SEP] Now sparsely populated, it is the site of several important Minoan sites suggesting that far more people lived here 3,000 years ago. [SEP] The settlements of today are small dusty villages only recently benefiting from electricity. [SEP] Many farming families still endure a difficult life on these low brush hills. [SEP] For those who want to explore the area, accommodations can be rented in private rooms in the larger villages. [SEP] Surprisingly even in this remote part of the island a procession of tour buses	arrives	every day from Ágios Nikólaos and beyond. [SEP] Its main attractions are easy to visit without the aid of a rental car. [SEP] One of Crete’s most influential religious institutions, Toploú Monastery (Moní Toploú), is found here on a windswept hilltop, surrounded by large swathes of fertile land bequeathed to it by grateful believers. [SEP] Founded in the 14th century, the monastery was built for contemplation, but also for protection against the very real threat of the Turks. [SEP] Toploú is a Turkish word meaning cannon — the more correct title for the monastery is Moní Akrotirianí — and it gives an indication that the leaders were no timorous recluses.
