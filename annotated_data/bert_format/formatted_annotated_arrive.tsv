The second tale apparently has nothing to do with the first. [SEP] It describes the narrator as a young boy in the early 1950s entering in midyear the class of Paul Bereyter, his new teacher: " There I stood, in my dark green pullover with the leaping stag on it, in front of fifty-one fellow pupils, all staring at me with the greatest possible curiosity, and, as if from a great distance, I heard Paul say that I had	arrived	at precisely the right moment, since he had been telling the story of the stag's leap only the day before " (Emigrants, p. 30).
