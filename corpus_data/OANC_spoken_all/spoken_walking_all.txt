So we uh, through tremendous diversionary tactics of dragging my leg and my elbow and so forth we managed to stop just at the, the edge of the road after blistering my elbow on a big knot of ice but uh, I don't think Marsha knew about that until a few years ago I guess I don't know it's been a while but uh, yeah the snow there in the winters were exciting to say the least.<n>I remember many mornings walking down to the bus where you know whatever you had in your nose would freeze.<n>It would just crunch and you went to blow your nose nothing liquid came out it was crystals and you'd get on the school bus and it would be so damn cold that the floor of the bus would just be a solid sheet of ice you'd have rock salt scattered on the floor of the bus in order to keep some kind of traction and uh, had a couple of deviant children there on the bus and one's name was Robbie Share.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
And on this particular night, it was night, they, they had a bull out there that was pretty mean and would charge the fence at people.<n>And um, Grandma, my grandmother, their mother, was walking with them that night.<n>She was going to watch TV.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BranchElbert.txt
And uh, it was dark, they really couldn't see.<n>And uh, they were walking up the path and Grandma accidentally stepped in something<n>that was really soft and her foot got to sinking and instead of her pulling that one foot back out and shaking it off to keep going, she stuck both feet in there and she started to holler.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BranchElbert.txt
mom would always sit us around at home at the evenings, um, and tell us about her days growing up.<n>They walking to school in the rain, sleet, and snow, five miles and all this other crazy stuff--<n>Uphill both ways.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BranchElbert.txt

I didn't know how to go around and try and find.<n>So I just pulled the van over and at the plant parking lot and I got out and started walking and I was just, I can remember live wires being everywhere, crackling and popping.<n>And the first thing I saw when I got home, was my neighbor over here, two houses over.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt

You know?<n>It's like a loaf of bread that you can chew on while you're walking down the street.<n>Yeah.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
But it's just wonderful!<n>There's, there's so many things that you never get the chance to see anywhere else, but you can see it all just walking around.<n>And then, of course, you have Lombard St, the crookedest street in the world.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
Absolutely the crookedest street in the world, yeah.<n>And all those are right there within walking distance.<n>Then you take a cable car and go to Chinatown.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt

And uh, one of us thought of the idea of sticking a newspaper in the mailbox and setting the mailbox and newspaper on fire.<n>So uh, one of us we were walking down the road picked up uh, a newspaper wadded it up and stuck it in the mailbox and uh, this was uh, metal mailbox with uh, brick around it.<n>And we stuck it in there and we lit it and it shot into a big old flame, you know lit up the whole sky.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
And we stuck it in there and we lit it and it shot into a big old flame, you know lit up the whole sky.<n>And I mean we were just, you know it got us real fired up you know and so uh, we were walking along a little further and we saw another newspaper and uh, we stuck it in the mailbox and it was another metal mailbox.<n>So uh, we were like "Cool!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
And, and, she said, uh my Granny said she got up and she, she looked up and she said, "You know, wonder who that could be?"<n>And so she sat back down, and, you know, they were still chatting, and they could still see this person, and this person was walking really, really fast.<n>And she said that her brother had this really distinctive walk and she said the more she looked at that person coming down that road she started thinking "No, that can't be, that can't be."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt
but she said, "It can't be."<n>So Granny got up, and she kind of walked down the steps off the porch and she was walking up towards the road and she then just stood there.<n>And then he was coming, she said he was coming really fast--she said could still remember all that dust kicking up on the road--and here he's coming down the road, and she turns around and she said, "It's Joe!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt

You guys can go, go down to the lake, just be careful."<n>And, uh, so they kind of walked over to the hill, kind of started walking down, and at a point they just had to sit on their butts and kind of slide down, and the trees were all cut, so they'd grab trees as they were going down.<n>And, um, I was just watching them, and I was up at the top, and then, I started down, I'd figured, let them go first, then I'd, I'd go kind of behind them.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt

Well, to back up, when I was just learning to walk, your grandmother and grandfather told me that when we'd go down to the beach and spend the summer at the beach, back then there was no air conditioning whatsoever, and so all the, the bars and the stores and everything on the boardwalks would have screened-in, screened doors on the front.<n>And any place we'd go by when I was walking with them, I'd have my hands up in the air and they'd be holding either hand--<n>--and when we'd go by any place that had a juke box playing, I had to stop and jog up and down in time to the music.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt

to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever<n>i think maybe walking or running would probably work because you it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2776-ms98-a-trans.txt

um-hum<n>um i you know i found that it's not necessary really necessary to knock yourself out to that degree to keep fit and i really think walking is probably one of the best things because it's something if you live into your nineties you could continue to do<n>i think so to well and i i was very pleased uh when uh during cold weather and i haven't lived in Charlotte North Carolina a full year yet but uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2843-ms98-a-trans.txt

do you we have a bicycle in the house<n>uh the kind that you pump you know that you can change the loading and she rides that and that seems to be uh probably other than walking that's probably one of the better things you can do<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3767-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know<n>a a fellow i work with uh in Houston he told me uh just this past week his wife was walking out of a mall ten o'clock in the morning in Houston and was robbed<n>oh my in the parking lot oh yes uh-huh um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3771-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah that's good<n>when we first adopted her we she she wasn't walking yet but she was soon walking within a couple weeks after that and now she's running all<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3806-ms98-a-trans.txt
so it was just that their muscles weren't as well toned as they started or<n>i i'm not sure if it was tone or exactly what it was but i i remember they had a lot of problems with their uh when when they got back to Earth uh walking you know they walk they couldn't walk very well<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3816-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah so anyway i could get a little bit of exercise that way um<n>yeah the winter of course even here in uh in northern Texas we do get a little cold weather but most of the winter i can go walking just about anytime i want to<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3827-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh she moved in it was only about<n>it's walking distance to where she lived  so she retained all her old friends and uh they they look after her and they serve pretty good meals<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3860-ms98-a-trans.txt
the dog had hopped out at the service station to go to the bathroom and uh we didn't know it until we got home and i mean you talk about somebody being frantic and upset and<n>and it took us three days of walking that little town and talking to everybody and handing out posters and pictures with pictures of the dog<n>oh my word<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3865-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>i think the one that really excited the kids our kids were quite young and that's when this moose great big antlers come walking right through our campground we had a fire going and and uh it just kind of sauntered through and went over to a stream and was eating and<n>didn't didn't mind you being there a bit huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3895-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and and do much in the way of either you like say fast walking or uh running i work downtown and it<n>not as convenient to get out at lunchtime downtown Dallas although there there is a Y very close i guess i could do that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3896-ms98-a-trans.txt
and it was about six thirty when i left the uh store<n>and i was walking back to my car<n>and boy i tell you i got spooked<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3920-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and uh there's walking trails on both sides a walking path and uh when i've gone down to visit him i've gone on that but uh that was clear full and up to up to some of the streets i guess it just gets<n>yeah we had a lot of flash floods in the area we had a few people who ran into uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3936-ms98-a-trans.txt
well that's good i mean at least you've given some time to it every day it's not as if you're not doing anything<n>it's  some some a little something yes but uh i really enjoy walking and somehow i'll do it for a while maybe a month or two months and you know walk two miles a day or something and then<n>and then quit i<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3958-ms98-a-trans.txt
and if i try to wait till the end of the day when i think i have a little bit more time i don't always have the energy level<n>yeah that's hard isn't it  uh that that four to six o'clock i see a lot of people out walking and i just think oh i'm just going to go and you know just sit<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3958-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah that<n>it is and it is hard to do i mean it is easier to do at home even the walking which i can do right here the idea of getting of getting in a car to drive to a<n>a place which a number of my friends keep suggesting<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3958-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh so you've thought about that as well a bike exercise<n>i've thought i've thought about doing that uh this tape is nice walking as i say is one that i really like i'm concerned about flexibility i'm i'm almost fifty and and i can you know begin to feel a little of that<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3958-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh yeah i agree<n>stuff like that when you have your door closed people just walking in and stuff like that<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3968-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah you're like i i really didn't want to do it i was just kidding you know i just  thought i'd come try it out<n>yeah  yeah i happened to be walking down the hall turned into some some other instructor's office and said help me  and he sold me on his program<n>yeah really<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3990-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>i know i've i've come to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's gonna just just keeping your senses about you and you know trying not to look like a victim<n>you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4023-ms98-a-trans.txt
of doing that either no  no i i i i just get a sense of our<n>walking in over and over and over again in places where we weren't well versed or something<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4030-ms98-a-trans.txt
yes now this one has been quite mild um<n>we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground<n>it was quite chilly but not<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4032-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh<n>walking is repeatable and bicycling is repeatable i i bicycle once in a while<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4053-ms98-a-trans.txt
and it takes me a while to get back into it so<n>well so do you do you enjoy your walking or is it just because you have to exercise you know you need to exercise<n>well there're two kinds one kind is where you just get out and you do it because you've got to do it and the other kind is<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4053-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>is uh actually most of the walking i've been doing these days is is just a bunch that i'm with uh<n>uh a couple of people in my group who we just<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4053-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and an innocent bystander and when looking back he had forty two convictions and yet he was still walking loose so we've got problem here with the alcohol especially that uh<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4054-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep<n>oh my word<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4055-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i mean like the right now i'm in uh our student center studying and i'll go out of my i'll walk up get up from my table and walk out of my way i mean well they're right near the trash can so i'll i'll toss it in the bin but um<n>as far as if i'm walking in the street drinking a soda and i finish it i'm going to toss it in the nearest trash can probably<n>i mean it's convenient it's it's there if the the recycling bin is not there i'm probably i'm if it was there i'd use it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4107-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah so i've just gotten up to um being able to jog one and a half to two miles and then<n>um about mile and a half of walking<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4126-ms98-a-trans.txt
so<n>well i do a lot of walking at work because i'm outside a lot so<n>oh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4126-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh okay<n>so i'm outside a lot i work on airplanes so i do a lot of walking there<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4126-ms98-a-trans.txt
you can um<n>i don't know do a lot of walking like you are and<n>do calisthenics or something i don't know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4126-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>they repeat the main headlines every half-hour so i would listen to two segments of that and you know really really know stuff and now that i'm just walking and riding the bus um<n>wow<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4136-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah uh<n>i mean as you're walking through that little tour in uh Munich it's kind of  they're trying to brainwash you too<n>oh of course of course they are they want you to buy their car yeah there it was it was interesting i was at i i also went to uh the Porsche and uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4137-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh my goodness<n>and i went out there the next mourning to feed her and i put her food in there and i walked out the gate and pretty soon i heard the gate slick open and she comes walking out behind me i was like<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4219-ms98-a-trans.txt
it's it's a lot better then nothing i think<n>oh yeah i've just recently um something i tried to incorporate into life style just recently is walking when i'm going short distances like when i'm at work if i'm going to go to a restraint for lunch just choosing one close enough to walk<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4221-ms98-a-trans.txt
six o'clock at night and well now i've got to go<n>well that's one that's one reason i actually do the walking where i tried other thing is it has a point to it<n>oh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4221-ms98-a-trans.txt
well this is something i just got back from working out yes um i'd spend about five or ten minutes stretching and then i i used to be just a walker i i was really into walking about three miles everyday and<n>oh did you<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4248-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah uh my exercise program i used i did run<n>uh for several reasons i now do mostly walking<n>uh one was that i had a knee injury i stepped in a<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4250-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah that too i mean uh the um<n>but the reason why i noticed you were talking about walking i i don't if i walk i'd have to walk like ten miles i think to you know for it to really sort of get the same benefit as running if i run uh really hard<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4250-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh now tell me about the tennis shoes for running and how what a difference that makes<n>well um i found out what a difference it makes i just had regular walking shoes that i was running in<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4255-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh really<n>yeah Reebok walking shoes and they just did not do the job at all<n>so about a week after i started running my shin started hurting i got shin splints<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4255-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and little things that they point out to me when i was walking around well this was done because of this or this was done because of that<n>so they're actually kind of thinking it through huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4256-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh yeah well you do i mean it's it's really jogging but i mean you can push yourself at different levels how hard you run<n>well even just walking<n>well but you know like say riding a bike where if you go really slow it's pretty much coasting you're not even doing anything<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4281-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh so i get to wear  just uh<n>how shall i say it uh walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4622-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>well walking how shall i say it kind of<n>like Avia uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4622-ms98-a-trans.txt
like Avia uh<n>walking shoes uh<n>well that's nice comfortable stuff<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4622-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know nicer usually nice summer slacks or more sometimes skirts stuff like that so then it's still<n>you know the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of walking and<n>coming in out of the office but you still have to have a professional<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4622-ms98-a-trans.txt
so we did look around i think my wife<n>is much better than i am at just walking into a place and getting a feeling for  whether it's a loving and caring place or not and uh so i would always trust her judgment on that<n>hm<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4649-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh have you have you done any jogging i tell you said you you did on the on the bike and on the treadmill in the in the uh clubs<n>no i've done some walking with friends in the past but i find that when you do that you do more chatting than you do exercise and that's not really beneficial<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4721-ms98-a-trans.txt
and they worked with her and<n>got her walking and got her taking kind of taking care of herself and so she was able to come back home<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4799-ms98-a-trans.txt
