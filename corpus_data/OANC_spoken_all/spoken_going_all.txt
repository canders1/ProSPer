The whole thing?<n>I was old enough at the time that I knew what was going on.<n>Yeah.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsElissa.txt
Yeah.<n>And uh, I remember exactly going to the hospital and the uh, waiting room, but um, yeah, it's just something you don't know anybody goes through.<n>It was a very interesting experience.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsElissa.txt
That's what I've heard, it's extremely hard.<n>What have you decided, what are you going to do?<n>I'm going to do Education now.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt
What have you decided, what are you going to do?<n>I'm going to do Education now.<n>Do you plan on staying in Charlotte?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt
They're actually both teachers.<n>So are they happy that you're going to be a teacher?<n>Or do would they rather you have stay in Nursing?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt
C's and D's, you know, and that's just not me.<n>I wish if I could do it all over again I would stay home and study instead of going out with my friends, which has really hurt me a lot.<n>Do you think that's what it was?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt
Yeah.<n>So you're just going to work a lot harder?<n>Work a lot harder, um, take some classes that I think are going to interest me more.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt
So you're just going to work a lot harder?<n>Work a lot harder, um, take some classes that I think are going to interest me more.<n>That's one thing about this school is they just give you like certain classes to take and they don't let you pick and choose what you want to take and stuff.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt
That's pretty much it.<n>I'm just going to tell everybody that they need to study!<n>Definitely study!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt
OK.<n>Um, we're going to talk about today childhood stories and what I'm wondering is what are the stories you remember as children?<n>I recall, a number of stories.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt
But I think the story that was, was a favorite was one that my mother made up herself, utilizing characters from, you know, like Bugs Bunny and, and Thumper and Bambi and all that.<n>And ah, she, she made it up, a story about a, me and my cousin Phil, ah, going on this trip to the Canadian Northwest to hunt and meeting these little characters, uh, while we were there.<n>Of course it can't be published because all those things are copyrighted, but my mother made up the story and I thought it was very nice and I still have it, uh, handwritten, uh, in our file here.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt
Go ahead.<n>Well, I'm going to ask a final question that, um, I mean, you're my parents, and you imparted a lot of, uh, a lot of the love of reading to me.<n>Uh, how important it was to read and we're all English majors, I think that has something to do with it; my brother, sister and I are all, we're all English majors in college.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt
Uh, how important it was to read and we're all English majors, I think that has something to do with it; my brother, sister and I are all, we're all English majors in college.<n>So, what I am going to ask you is what was your philosophy behind that?<n>Why is reading so important?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt
At about, about three weeks later, then arrived a group of about four, at my brother's house, and told him, that they were coming to, to be, that is to take control of the place, where we lived.<n>Well, but that they weren't going to steal, they weren't going to kill, neither would they harm the people, but it we didn't, if we worked with them.<n>But if we didn't want to work with them, we shouldn't get them into anything with the mil, military, such as, informing on them, or something like that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
Then when, well, since I lived alone, only with my son, they, would seek me out because, I always had, everything, because I had all kinds of animals, including doves from Castile, uh, turkeys, ducks, hens, pigs, cows, all kinds of animals.<n>So they would, they would always come to me, and they told me, "Ma'am, sell us milk, sell us yogurt, sell us cheese, or sell us a, a hog, a plump hog, well I had to sell them, and I am going to sell," he'd said, "if you sell them to everyone else, sell to us, too."<n>I say to him, "OK."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
So, he, he came looking for, yogurt, I don't know what he came looking for, for me to sell him.<n>And when I was giving it to him, he said to me, "There's going to be, a meeting now."<n>"When?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
"In Piedras de Sal," that was, like a, pretty, level, place where, they gathered.<n>And I said to him, "I'm not going to be able to go."<n>"Why?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
I said to him, "But you know, I'm your friend, tell me why."<n>Then he said to me that, "they're going to set up a board," he said to me, "where they're going to appoint," he said to me, "a president, vice president, secretary, treasurers," and all that.<n>And I said to him, "And what is that for?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
And I said to him, "And what is that for?"<n>"Because they're going to set up a committee," he said to me, "so that when those big battalions," he said to me, "of guerrillas arrive, these people attend, for example, the president is going to talk to the rest so that they all get food together for them.<n>And they've picked you," he said to me.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
"Yes," he said.<n>So, I said, "No," I said, "I'm not going to be able to go."<n>He said, "But, don't you ever tell, that I told you, because-," he said.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
He said, "But, don't you ever tell, that I told you, because-," he said.<n>He motioned to me as if they were going to cut off his head.<n>I said, "No, I'm not going to tell them."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
He motioned to me as if they were going to cut off his head.<n>I said, "No, I'm not going to tell them."<n>So, the next day, I left early in the morning for San Miguel, to see my daughter, and when I was coming back, I went by my brother's, which was a place in, a town called Chapeltique, and I arrived at his place, and I said, his name is Salomon, and I said, "Brother, I am here to see if you'll give me posada (lodging)," we call it, like you give someone a place to live in your own house.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
So, the next day, I left early in the morning for San Miguel, to see my daughter, and when I was coming back, I went by my brother's, which was a place in, a town called Chapeltique, and I arrived at his place, and I said, his name is Salomon, and I said, "Brother, I am here to see if you'll give me posada (lodging)," we call it, like you give someone a place to live in your own house.<n>And he said, "What's going on?"<n>I said, "Nothing, it's just that, I don't want to be there any longer," I said, "Look, it's just that I have lots of problems with the animals, I don't even have a pasture."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
"Nothing," he said, "Why?"<n>"I was going to bother you," I said (), "so you come with me," I say, "I want you to do me a favor."<n>"Uh-huh?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
You suggest something."<n>"OK," he said, "Let me, wait for me here, I'm going to let dad know, and Cristobal's neighbors' friends."<n>And he left, and that's how it was.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
And he left, and that's how it was.<n>When he came back, he said, "Yes," so, he said, "I'm going to leave here," he said, "from your house for Chapeltique at four in the morning with the livestock."<n>And that's how it was, he left, at dawn, and he said, "See you there," and he left with the, with the livestock, with the, and the, the others who were going to help.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
When he came back, he said, "Yes," so, he said, "I'm going to leave here," he said, "from your house for Chapeltique at four in the morning with the livestock."<n>And that's how it was, he left, at dawn, and he said, "See you there," and he left with the, with the livestock, with the, and the, the others who were going to help.<n>I stayed at home, finishing straightening up, and the neighbors, Pedro's boys, already took my things to town, and, we left for Chapeltique.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
They hid and, the soldiers came to the house.<n>It was, when the first one arrived, the first soldier, and he said, "Er, ma'am, make," he said, "some four, six rations," he said, "because plenty of soldiers have come, and I'm going to inform the other houses."<n>I stayed, making the rations of food when a group of soldiers arrives, and when I was, fixing the food, in the kitchen, because of the sun, because of the reflection of the sun, I saw, a weapon pointing at me, so that was when I said to him, "What happened?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
And then the soldiers would pass through just the same.<n>So you couldn't tell what kind, at night, what kind of people were going by, but you could hear clatter, because even beasts full of weapons, with, everything, you know?<n>So that time, that I told you about when the, the soldiers came, my son escaped, dying, from fear, when I go that they had me at gunpoint, and they surrounded the house, but it passed, they didn't do anything.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
The next time the soldiers, came through, the guerrillas were in front of the house, in the road, there's one, of those huge rocks, that you can sit on, and when they were eating.<n>When all of a sudden, a girl went by, I was washing (clothes), a girl went by, and she told me she was going to here mom's, her name is Victoria.<n>And when, the guerrillas, ah, well, the girl went by and very shortly she came back.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
Red-faced, tired, and red-faced, the man, and on the other side, the other end of the house, there were two others, shooting, so that, also, also stretched out on the ground.<n>Then I said, "Dear Lord," I said, "what are we going to do about this?"<n>Well, they went through, they broke a soldier's leg, you could hear his moaning.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
And that's the way it stayed, the firefights there, in that place, and the firefights.<n>Well, one day, I sai, I was going from San Miguel, uh, to Carolina, my brother lived, my brother was the principal of that, of that school there, in Carolina.<n>He worked, he's a teacher, and at that time he worked as the principal of that school, of that school, because it was a, like a high school, there was, from first (grade) to high school.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
He worked, he's a teacher, and at that time he worked as the principal of that school, of that school, because it was a, like a high school, there was, from first (grade) to high school.<n>So, early that morning, that afternoon, I came down from San Miguel, and I told him, "I'm going to go."<n>He says, "Don't go.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
They're making trincheras," they call them trincheras, where they're putting mounds of stones near the houses, so that the bullets there.<n>He says, "And it's going to be very dangerous and it's very late."<n>So, I said to him, "Oh, well, I'm going to go when it's morning."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
He says, "And it's going to be very dangerous and it's very late."<n>So, I said to him, "Oh, well, I'm going to go when it's morning."<n>My son was already two, not even two years old, like, like about, like a year and a half.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
Well, he milked the cow every morning, but that day, he couldn't milk her, because the gunfire was so heavy, and because everything was falling near the house.<n>So, my brother said, "I'm going to cut her rope, I'm not going to be able to untie her," he said, "Because it's really difficult with, by the time I untie her, they'll kill me," he says.<n>"I'm going to cut it with the, a knife, the knot, so the cow can go and she won't die."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
So, my brother said, "I'm going to cut her rope, I'm not going to be able to untie her," he said, "Because it's really difficult with, by the time I untie her, they'll kill me," he says.<n>"I'm going to cut it with the, a knife, the knot, so the cow can go and she won't die."<n>Then, he, is, when, a shell like this<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
Only Luis Alonso had gone out.<n>Well, nobody noticed my brother until he said, "Vieja (Old lady)," he said, because that's how they talked to each other, "Vieja," he said, "I may be going to die," and we turned him around to see what the, the.<n>He had a pillow, one of those big pillows, and it looked red, all of it with blood and swollen like this<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
she said to them, to the guerrillas, "Bastards!"<n>she said to them, "because of you we're going to die too, through no fault of our own!"<n>she said.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
They didn't answer.<n>She closed the door, and Ines said to me, "What are we going to do with Luis Alonso?"<n>Now we, now we didn't, we didn't pay attention to the kids, we had forgotten about the kids, we were going to attend to my brother.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
She closed the door, and Ines said to me, "What are we going to do with Luis Alonso?"<n>Now we, now we didn't, we didn't pay attention to the kids, we had forgotten about the kids, we were going to attend to my brother.<n>But, a car was coming by with a white flag that meant "peace" and in that car there was a friend of Luis Alonso's and also a guerrilla came in that car.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
I've come to see Luis Alonso," he says.<n>Because, well, no, Ines was putting up an argument that-, when he told her, "No," he said, e, Luis Alonso, "I may be going to die," he said, "because so much blood loss," he said.<n>"No," he said, "I'm going to take you to such guerrillas' doctor," and they took him away.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
Because, well, no, Ines was putting up an argument that-, when he told her, "No," he said, e, Luis Alonso, "I may be going to die," he said, "because so much blood loss," he said.<n>"No," he said, "I'm going to take you to such guerrillas' doctor," and they took him away.<n>They took out all the rest (of the shrapnel), but the one in his eyebrow, they couldn't get it out.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
And they put out the, the word that yes, they had killed him.<n>So, and if another, another person did that, they were going to kill him too.<n>Because, there were a lot more things.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
When, um, I was little, I lived more, near Lake Norman side of Charlotte.<n>If you're not from Charlotte, you're not going to know where that's at, but, um, it was really far away from everybody and behind the airport and stuff like that.<n>And, um, my junior year of high sch, high school, we moved into like the city, the west side of Charlotte, and I went to West Meck, and that was a, um, culture experience, \\ I guess \\.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
Because like he saw that like, I think he saw that I was like him before I would admit that I was like him.<n>Because he knew that I was going to do what I wanted to do without disrespecting my parents or do anything like that because I was still like not going to run out in a rampage and kind and be like a horrible person, but it was just like my life now and--<n>And what's your major?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
And `cause I was really involved in theater and stuff in high school and everything like that.<n>And kind of like coming in to college or whatever, he kind of convinced me that what else am I going to do?<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
Uh-huh.<n>If I, he's like, "You're not going to do anything, da-da-da."<n>He wasn't real supportive about it at all.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
Then they got the whole schedule thing for the next year with the tuition bill on it and everything like that and my mom was reading it and it said, "Major THEA," and she was like, "What is this?"<n>She knew I was going to do it, but Dad was pretty irate.<n>Then I started paying him half the tuition bill.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
That's probably why I'm a theater major so I can kind of, you know, do what plays I want and then move on.<n>Do you think they've become more ex, do you think they've accepted more what you've decided to do or that's going to take a while?<n>Or if they ever will at all?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
To have something to fall back on and everything like that.<n>And I'm like, I'm trying to convince him to, you know, if I don't make it and there's a strong possibility I won't, I know that, I'm not stupid, I'm nor going to go to L.A. and make five million or more than that--<n>Right.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
Right.<n>And do all that, and I mean, if I don't make it, my life's not going to be over or something, like I can't go back to school.<n>So you'll go back to school if that doesn't work out?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
And stuff like that.<n>I'm kind of going to do what I'm going to do.<n>That's why I stand out in my family.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
I love it!<n>I do, but it gets to a point where like I feel like if I fail, it's just going to be like way too much for everybody.<n>And, I don't know, it's like my grandparents, I'm the youngest one.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
Uh-huh.<n>So nobody knows what they're going to be yet and considering Chris is raising them, that doesn't, you know, say too much for them two little girls.<n>Whose girls?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
This is the fourth summer I've done it.<n>So now I'm going to run three pools over the summer.<n>A big responsibility!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
You can't go into it and be like, "Oh!<n>I'm going to be a big movie star one day!"<n>and everything like that, because the people like that are the ones that are disappointed the most and then like end up nowhere.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
That's a good attitude!<n>Well, I definitely think you're going to do something with it and I want to thank you for talking to us.<n>No problem!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
Do you think there'll be a very big culture shock?<n>I don't know that it will be a very big culture shock, because I've grown up going to Boston all the time.<n>So it's almost like a second home.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt
Um, I'll definitely be ready for the change.<n>I've been going up as a progress in school, so I, it will be a good change for me.<n>So you'll stay here for the four years and then move, or would you transfer schools?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt
Although I do enjoy Spring and March here.<n>How was it going to high school in Charlotte?<n>Do you feel like, do you think it would have been different if you had gone to school in Boston or someplace else up north?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt
For North Carolina?<n>They say we're going up in the mountains to find some snow.<n>Really?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeIII.txt
Uh-huh.<n>When are you going to that?<n>I think at Christmas and I'm getting a knife set.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeIII.txt
That sounds dangerous.<n>But I'm never going to take the knives out.<n>Oh, OK.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeIII.txt
That sounds like fun.<n>Are you going to get gifts for anyone this year?<n>Are you going to buy any gifts for people or make anything?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeIII.txt
Are you going to get gifts for anyone this year?<n>Are you going to buy any gifts for people or make anything?<n>Maybe.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeIII.txt
Oh, we lived uh, not far from the Susquehanna River where our church was down that way, Skinners Eddy United Methodist Church specifically and I don't know if it was in the year that the king died there in '77 or if it was '78, but a flood came and course the kids were all you know told to leave school, parents would come get you, the buses ran special routes and so forth.<n>I remember going down to the church and there was a group of men there that were organizing an uh, evacuation of all the valuables of the church, take them to the second floor.<n>We had a large tractor-trailer parked out front and uh,<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
I fortunately remembered when Mom and I left to go to the church to bring a wrench and couple pairs of pliers because of course the pews were bolted to the floor.<n>This as a young child kind of stunned me you know that we're going to go evacuate pews from a church and we're not going to bring any tools with us of course this was predating Makita battery tools looking back in retrospect we could have used Makita tools would have been far more productive but carrying the pews out of that church and loading them in that truck and by the time we got done the trailer wheels were covered with water and uh, we just kind of made it by the skin of our teeth that we got everything out of there.<n>Yeah, um, how about because I know weather always reeked uh, certainly during the wintertime and all of the snowstorms that would come uh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
So,<n>I have my sister's kid here and I'm going to kill him underneath this vehicle shortly.<n>So we uh, through tremendous diversionary tactics of dragging my leg and my elbow and so forth we managed to stop just at the, the edge of the road after blistering my elbow on a big knot of ice but uh, I don't think Marsha knew about that until a few years ago I guess I don't know it's been a while but uh, yeah the snow there in the winters were exciting to say the least.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
We'd basically coasted down into town and got about 50 gallons of kerosene and pumped it in the fuel tank so that so that the fuel would actually run through the fuel lines and the bus would run.<n>And you're going to school in those conditions.<n>Right.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
Right.<n>That was uh, that was the most exciting part of you know, most important, most exciting part of going to school was getting there for me.<n>Alive.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
She told him to shut-up and get her a pack of cigarettes.<n>She got gangrene in her foot and he said if you don't quit smoking you're going to lose your foot.<n>She said, "I'm going shoe shopping," and kept on smoking.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
She got gangrene in her foot and he said if you don't quit smoking you're going to lose your foot.<n>She said, "I'm going shoe shopping," and kept on smoking.<n>Died with both feet and talking the whole way.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
Uh-huh.<n>Now this is going back to the fifties and early sixties when you could still do that but he'd send these young girls, 10 or 11 years old maybe, down to the general store and get him a pack of cigarettes well, with the change they could buy licorice and candy and what not.<n>"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy send those girls to get those filthy cigarettes."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
An oops.<n>And uh, everyone you know going out to eat or anything like that then uh, the waiter would say to my parents, "What would you like, what would you like?"<n>and then they ask my sister what would she like for my son.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
He's their's."<n>You know she wasn't going to claim me.<n>My sister had uh, an apartment in NJ and I remember there was, she had a roommate, young girl which hindsight is 20/20 she used to say she was going to kidnap in the middle of the night, put me in bed with her.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
You know she wasn't going to claim me.<n>My sister had uh, an apartment in NJ and I remember there was, she had a roommate, young girl which hindsight is 20/20 she used to say she was going to kidnap in the middle of the night, put me in bed with her.<n>I would just scream and scream you know that, "No, no, don't do that."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
I would just scream and scream you know that, "No, no, don't do that."<n>But stories I remember hearing one of uh, I believe it was Marsha uh, the wind caught the storm door there she was, she was uh, hanging on to the back storm door and I guess pulled it open a little bit to see what was going on and the wind caught it and threw her right out in the yard.<n>Yard.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
He buckles down onto the floor.<n>I think uh-oh 200 pounds of mush going to be laying on the floor,<n>I'll never get him up you know.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
Uh-hum.<n>A lot of crystal and plates and she had a plate rail in the dining room that ran around, you know so far down from the ceiling and that damn little bird would walk behind those plates and you, you just knew he was going to knock a plate knock off, a plate off but he never did.<n>Chased him all the way up to the upstairs, I don't think the bird ever even pooped in the house not that we found--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
And um, Grandma, my grandmother, their mother, was walking with them that night.<n>She was going to watch TV.<n>And uh, it was dark, they really couldn't see.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BranchElbert.txt
Umm, go ahead and tell me about a story.<n>Well I can remember as a small child probably between the ages of three and seven going to Asheville and visiting my grandmother umm and my grandfather but he died when I was fairly young so I mostly remember visiting my grandmother.<n>She lived in a small house in Asheville.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CaseCullen.txt
I don't know those are the, the sort of stick out in my mind about visiting Asheville.<n>Um we always tended to stop somewhere scenic either going to or coming from.<n>We went to Chimney Rock on a number of occasions.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CaseCullen.txt
And uh mostly because my dad, my dad's side of the family were Southern Baptists from the mountains of North Carolina, my mom was a Catholic from California which, oh, just scared everybody right there.<n>So, before she even had the opportunity to meet my mom she had already decided that she was this, this evil heathen creature that was going to corrupt her beautiful boy um and even wrote her a nasty letter to that effect.<n>Um, she pretty much showed a lot of disinterest at best and, and outright hostility at worst towards my mom until we the kids came along.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CaseCullen.txt
You're not going to hear yourself on the tape.<n>( ) OK go ahead.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt
( ) OK go ahead.<n>OK Adam is now going to talk<n>about the music industry.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt
So I was able to get out into the actual music industry the recording industry and, unfortunately, one aspect of the recording industry, when you get started, a lot of times you have to do either very low-paying or non-paying internships to get into the recording studio.<n>Specifically, I mean, if you want to work at, work at one of these places, they, they, uh, generally have a lot of free help, so, uh, you're not going to make a whole lot of money doing this and they expect you to put in a full time schedule so you really can't work another job.<n>But at any rate, I had this, this freedom and, um, the girl had come into my life to, to go and pursue this dream, so, um, I started working at place called D&D Studios, which was known for doing, um, a lot of hip hop music, kind of stuff similar to what I was interested in and I was hoping I'd be able to make some, some connections at least, maybe do a little bit of networking there, and, uh, I met some pretty cool people, did some really kind of really interesting projects, um, but--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt
It was really dirty and had a reputation as being such, um, kind of a grungy atmosphere, environment, but where you could do what you wanted to do and get stuff done and what have you.<n>From there that was kind of frustrating me a little bit, going into, um, sessions every day or every night and having 15 people around me smoking fat blunts, drinking forties of Old English, and really not getting a whole lot of stuff done that was, it was, it was just depressing.<n>And, uh, seeing people with no real creative potential getting paid to do music wasn't very encouraging or inspiring to me.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt
, you know, basically crossing paths on the way out as, as Kim was coming in and get to work stay at work until five a.m.<n>come home as Kim was getting up and getting ready for work, go to sleep, she goes to work, I wake up, eat, shower and all that good stuff, and then, uh, she's coming home and I'm going out again.<n>After doing that for a couple of weeks it's kind of like, "Damn," you know.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt
OK.<n>What stories do you tell yourself to keep going through hard times?<n>Funny, sad, whatever.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
Uh, we hadn't been married long and, and we were driving down the road one day.<n>I saw a box in the middle of the road, you know, and I looked over at him and, you know, men always automatically, you can just see them lining up like they're going to hit that, you know?<n>Yep.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
' And he said, "I couldn't, it was like interstate and I couldn't, could not move over either way.<n>I knew I was going to run over it."<n>And he said, "I thought, `Now just wait and see if it does anything.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
He, um, we were in CA, and we had been in San Francisco for about three days and this is my first trip to CA.<n>And I was just fascinated with the big city: San Francisco life, so many cars and, and the day that we were going the shuttle bus was taking us back to um, the airport: LAX.<n>We were going to L.A. Well, we got on the shuttle bus and it just dawned on me, you know.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
And I was just fascinated with the big city: San Francisco life, so many cars and, and the day that we were going the shuttle bus was taking us back to um, the airport: LAX.<n>We were going to L.A. Well, we got on the shuttle bus and it just dawned on me, you know.<n>And I said, and I told him, "You know, I've been here three days and as many police cars as I've seen," I said, you know, "I've not seen a single accident."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
Everything, you know?<n>Because you'd hear furniture crashing, but I can remember we went straight over to the window and we still had power, but we went straight to the window and it was just, I honestly, I think, thought we were going to die.<n>All right, you could see transformers popping everywhere!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
I'd see film clips on TV where like a policeman got killed.<n>He was going across the bridge and, you know, it was so foggy he didn't know the bridge was out and it was just there, you know, and the entire surrounding area around us was like that.<n>There were bridges out, just, and not necessarily just a bridge.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
There were bridges out, just, and not necessarily just a bridge.<n>Just, all of a sudden there would be a sinkhole in the middle of the highway and cars were just going down into it, you know, that didn't know that it was there.<n>So if it hadn't been for that guy and that radio, we would never have made it to the airport.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
That's right.<n>And I thought, "No security patrol's going to be out here."<n>But uh, you know, my and, and, when I got out there to where the little dock was at for the paper, I could see my van.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
But uh, you know, my and, and, when I got out there to where the little dock was at for the paper, I could see my van.<n>I parked right beside this great big tree, and all that while I worried about my van, but not enough to where I was going to go out there and move it.<n>You know?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
I'm like, "Nice try, Richard but my van is fine.<n>I've been going over there all night long."<n>Been checking.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
"Get under the bed!"<n>Mike going to say, "Get under the bed!"<n>Right.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
And we'd sit there and just watch.<n>But now I wasn't stupid or nothing when the lights were going `shz, shz,' you know, but she's, "Get under the bed!"<n>in her bedroom.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
in her bedroom.<n>She's got one of those tall four-poster beds, like that w as going to save us, but we had to get under there a lot when I was growing up, bad storms--<n>Yeah.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
Absolutely.<n>And I'm afraid that all of them are going to be like him in the area.<n>I mean, at least it's not, nobody likes to read like I do.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
And if she reads a one-point book and takes a test on it, she misses a question, she gets point-nine.<n>The reading another one point book, she's going to get, say she gets a 100 on it, she's still only got one-point-nine and she had to have two points.<n>So, every week it seems like I have to go to the library and get these little point-five books as, I call them "fillers," just to fill in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
He said, "I promise you that I could stand outside in this yard and look across the harbor where you can see the whole bay area," and he said, "If it was quiet enough, you could swear you could hear champagne glasses clinking together."<n>Your, I guess your imagination, you know, what all going on there, you know.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
Um-hum.<n>But it's always something going on.<n>And, you know, it's just the culture and I'm always thinking, you know, it's not, at least they're not expecting, they are providing you some type of entertainment; they're doing something, you know.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
That's neat.<n>Yeah, just, it's just really nice to see all those things going on.<n>I can remember this guy standing there and he had this little dog.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
Things that you do not see every day!<n>It's almost like going to Carowinds or someplace and seeing all these little, special little things, you know.<n>But they're all over the place.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
"Forget it!"<n>But, no, he um, one time put, he said, "I'm going to marinate these salmon steaks."<n>Neither one of us had had it in our whole married life.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
"Uh-huh, that would be nice."<n>He's going to marinate it and cook it later, you know.<n>And it ended up--, and oh God!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
It was awful!<n>"I'm not going to do that again!"<n>On salmon steak, I know.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
Well, because it was really interesting stuff.<n>It was about the same time when all the space program was getting started off and I was in the first grade when the United States launched the first satellite and I was in the second grade when the first manned space capsule was sent up and because of what was going on at the time it was real interesting.<n>The book just tied right into it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CheezemBurt.txt
I think it's important because it's the real link you have to your past and heritage and it's also declining for the same reasons you mentioned.<n>People just don't have the time or take the time to keep the traditions going<n>they just get too busy or too lazy.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CheezemBurt.txt
Certainly.<n>I have some motorcycle stories going back two to three generations actually.<n>And now that I know your own son is considering purchasing a motorcycle those stories hopefully can help him make // a wise decision //.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CheezemBurt.txt
All right, now what?<n>Oh I know what I was going to tell you.<n>Um, another thing my mother read to us was poetry and she also had books that had songs in it, children's songs and so not only did she teach us the words to all those things, but we sang them too.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt
But as they get older, I think children are so involved in other things.<n>They're going to lessons for this and that, and sports, and they're playing interactive games with their computer and, uh, watching TV, and I think, really, they're not reading on their own, like maybe we did when I was that age because we didn't have all those other things to do.<n>So I think maybe, reading for young people, is not as important.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt
I think it probably does, because they're just not reading as much.<n>Um, the good students, the ones who do well academically, they're going to do OK anyway, but the ones, um, there are some that would really benefit from continuing their reading, either being read to or reading on their own, for pleasure--<n>Right.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt
OK, well<n>, um, going back to you, do you think, uh, are there any other ways you can see that reading and listening to stories, and literacy, um, being exposed to literacy, has um, affected you in your life?<n>Hmm, well<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt
Um.<n>This is a story that my dad told me when I was small, a long time ago that, there was a girl that, she was very young, she was going to go visit her parents.<n>And she was like driving on a curve.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CorderoRosalinda.txt
And she was like driving on a curve.<n>And she was, she was going very, too fast, and she crashed and then she, um,<n>she goes there, um, every year she comes out at night and then one time a guy passed through that curve and saw her and he stopped there and picked her up and she told him that if she can, if he can take her home to her parents house.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CorderoRosalinda.txt
And uh, we were all spending the night at Craig's house and uh, we decided we wanted to sneak out of the house.<n>Well, it was about 1:00 in the morning and uh, Craig was scared we were going to wake his parents up or his mom up.<n>And uh, you know after a little while we ended up talking him into it and uh, so we all snuck out his window in his bedroom and um, we proceeded to uh, go over to uh,<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
So we thought we were being sneaky, but uh, found out the whole time we were being watched.<n>And uh, so after that, uh, the, uh, old man that we burned his mailbox down, uh, told us that, uh, he was going to, he would press charges unless we replaced and fixed his mailbox.<n>So uh, that whole day I think we put up two newspaper mailboxes, uh, one complete wood frame and plastic mailbox and that was cemented in the ground.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
, I live out on Moss Lake, it is in Shelby, North Carolina, Cherryville actually, uh<n>, me and a buddy of mine from way back in elementary school, we were best friends back then, uh, I invited him over to my house and we were going to go out onto the lake.<n>I have a jet ski and he's got one too and, uh, so we, we went out there and started drinking a couple of beers.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
And uh,<n>we ended up drinking more then going out in the water and, uh, we were out in the water and, uh, we come up and we were going to get another beer off the dock and, uh, he, uh, runs his jet ski up on land, and we had to pull it back and put it in water.<n>And we check it out and it is all right and by this time we are getting pretty, uh, inebriated, I guess you'd call it, and, uh, we were out there just acting stupid on the jet skis.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
And, uh, at one point in time he actually runs into me on my jet ski and, uh, bends the handle bars and runs up on my legs and I got a big bruise on my legs, but I'm not feeling it then, I'm pretty well gone by this time.<n>And, uh, it's getting late in the afternoon and he says he has to get home, and he doesn't live on the lake so we load up his jet ski and, uh, put it on the trailer on the back of my truck and uh, we're going to go back to his house to take it back.<n>So, uh, we get it back on the trailer and we find out that, uh, we bent the handlebar on it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
We're like, "Yeah, yeah we're fine," you know.<n>And uh, they're like, "All right," but they, they didn't have any idea that we were, uh, that we were leaving and we were going to take the, uh, jet ski back to his house.<n>They thought we were just going to stay at the house.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
And uh, they're like, "All right," but they, they didn't have any idea that we were, uh, that we were leaving and we were going to take the, uh, jet ski back to his house.<n>They thought we were just going to stay at the house.<n>So, uh, we get the handlebar bent back and, uh, we take off and, um, we are on the way to his house, and uh, I run off the road at one point.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
And I was in the truck, I didn't know what was wrong.<n>And I swerved and uh, luckily enough the truck hit the front fender somehow and I bounced off the telephone pole, and it was still going and, uh, I had no, I mean I was just totally in shock.<n>I didn't know what was going on.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
And I swerved and uh, luckily enough the truck hit the front fender somehow and I bounced off the telephone pole, and it was still going and, uh, I had no, I mean I was just totally in shock.<n>I didn't know what was going on.<n>And, uh, ( ) the truck and I'm like I am all right.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
Um, I don't know how much I'd be into reading to just, you know, like a, a program of just reading to children kind of thing.<n>But when I do have children, I'm going make sure that either, um, you know, my wife reads to them or that, you know, or make it a point that I read to them `cause I think it's, it's really important.<n>And actually, uh, my sister has two young children and, um, she's constantly reading to, to her child and, who's two years old now.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt
And she just seems like a pretty bright, intelligent kid compared to some other two year olds that I've, that I've encountered.<n>Are there any personal stories about your past and history and growing up that you're going to tell your children?<n>Um, yeah.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt
Um, yeah.<n>I'm sure that there's going be stories that I'll, I'll tell them about.<n>Um, to tell you the truth, I'll definitely tell my kids, you know, things about, you know, stories about when I was growing up and maybe some things that, you know, you should or shouldn't do.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt
Um, in particular I could, I could think of a few things.<n>Um, I know when I was really younger, I'll tell them this story, about never going near, uh, a frozen pond because when I was really young, um, the lake by my house had frozen over, actually it was just a pond, but it was a pretty big one, um, and we always use to play ice hockey and what not on it.<n>And it started to um, get warmer outside, but there was still a layer of ice on top of it, and a bunch of my friends had gone out on to the, the dock.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt
I remember general things, I remember one time, we were at the shore, my fam, my grandfather had a house in Stone Harbor and there was a hurricane and I remember, um, you know, we moved all the furniture inside for the hurri, hurricane and we went out and he had an awning over his porch and, you know, and we, we double-tied the awning down.<n>During the hurricane we'd go out and check to make sure that uh, uh, you know, all the strings were still tied and the awning wasn't going to blow away, but I don't remember, you now, I don't think we'd sit around and telling that story I mean, I occasionally mention that.<n>"Do you remember?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichDavid.txt
It seemed like it.<n>This was before, this was when my grandfather and her weren't married so we would go over and read it with me I was not even sure what was going on, but um,<n>, but I just remember having to read that and that was it um, with her.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichMegan.txt
I was living, uh, right outside of St. Louis, between Jefferson City and St. Louis, MO.<n>Um, my parents had a small house on a very friendly suburban street and, ah, one summer day I remember going out to the back of our yard, which seemed really big then.<n>Uh, I reached into my parents small garden, it had quite a few tomatoes in it, and I just started lobbing the tomatoes over the fence, and I kept lobbing the tomatoes over the fence, and then my next door neighbor, who was probably about four, my playmate at the time, he rode his Big Wheel down the, down the hill there and came and started throwing the tomatoes with me and we were just having a great time not thinking about anything, laughing having a lot of fun<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
He came, he opened the door and I remember looking back and seeing the expression on his face, and I could tell that he was disappointed.<n>He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't, I wasn't really sure if what I had done was really, really wrong I just knew that he wasn't very happy about what was going on by the way he opened the door and by the way he told me I needed to come into the house, and I, I came over there and I stepped up and I didn't even say, "Bye," to my friend and was probably not into that kind of thing I didn't really notice at that time probably I just went into the house.<n>And Dad said he had noticed, he had seen me throwing tomatoes in Mrs. Faulk's yard, so he told me that I was in trouble and I was going to get a spanking, and, um, I was kind of uh, uh looking for an out so I was smart enough to say, "Hey Dad!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't, I wasn't really sure if what I had done was really, really wrong I just knew that he wasn't very happy about what was going on by the way he opened the door and by the way he told me I needed to come into the house, and I, I came over there and I stepped up and I didn't even say, "Bye," to my friend and was probably not into that kind of thing I didn't really notice at that time probably I just went into the house.<n>And Dad said he had noticed, he had seen me throwing tomatoes in Mrs. Faulk's yard, so he told me that I was in trouble and I was going to get a spanking, and, um, I was kind of uh, uh looking for an out so I was smart enough to say, "Hey Dad!<n>Before you give me a spanking, why don't you just let me have one big glass of chocolate milk first?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
I remember, yeah I remember that based on later conversations that I ( ) with him about it, but at the time I guess I really wasn't sure what it was about, but I knew<n>that when it all came down to the bottom of it, I knew that what I had done was the wrong thing to do and he told me that I'm going to probably have to go down there and help Mrs. Faulk pick up the tomatoes when it's all said and done, and I remember being a little bit nervous about that.<n>I didn't really know Mrs. Faulk very well she was about 80 and, ah, she was a nice person I had seen her a few times but I was really nervous about that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
There was a, ah, a rose garden back there and my sister, it's ironic her middle name is Rose.<n>Her name is Christy Rose Farrow, and she was back there with me and we're going back and seeing these roses and Christy was smelling the roses and she started to put the petals up her nose, and I remember watching her put the petals up there, and I remember watching her put the petals up her nose, and I wasn't really sure why she was doing it.<n>I didn't really ask any questions I just thought it was interesting that she was putting the petals up her nose, and it kind of became fun to kind of cheer her into keep doing it, so I was like keeping going, keep going, "Yes!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
I think she was most unhappy with me because, you know, ah, ah, Christy was only one or one and a half or two and I was the big brother so from there I guess I remembered mom being upset with me because ah Christy had all those petals up her nose and it took a long time to take them out there was a lot of them up there, but, ah, later on, as I grew older, we moved around a lot when I was a kid I remember the first day I woke up and there was a moving truck.<n>One day I woke up and there was a moving truck in my, in my yard and I woke up to this sound of that and I looked out the window and there's this moving truck and there's people moving stuff in and I got up and I said, "Mom they're taking our stuff," and I was, and she was like, "Yes, we're moving today," and I was about four going on five at the time and so they're taking our stuff out so anyway we moved and they took all our stuff out and moved and she said, you know, "I told you we're moving.<n>You must have forgot," and I must have because it totally took me by surprise, and we ended up at a new place and I remember this, this new house that we were at and, ah, in a pretty area and it had a much bigger yard than the one.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
I can't remember what it was but I suddenly got really nervous that I was about to go to school for the first time and that was probably the most stressful day of my life.<n>I had forgotten that I was moving to a new place and I had forgotten that I was, uh, going to be going to school.<n>That was, that was a pretty scary day.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
Um, when I was young we used to go on a lot of yearly vacations.<n>Every year we'd go from, whether it be MO to IL or IO to IL or KS to IL, the whole time I was growing up because in IL that's where my grandparents lived and every year we'd go up there and spend about a week with them in the summer, and we'd also go down there for Christmas too, but mostly I remember going down there every year, um, for the summer and it was, ah, a lot of arguing in the car, and I remember sitting next to my, uh, I had two sisters, so the middle one was always in the middle, for some reason.<n>She was, she was, uh, the middle one's always in the middle.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
Um, um another memory with my family that I have is that we had a lot of weddings, ah, and these weddings were always really big weddings, and I've always been told the reason why they're so big is because basically it's Polish, you know.<n>Half of my family's Polish, so Polish, we have big weddings and I remember at my cousin's wedding I was like 12 years old going to it and I had a my cousin Tim and he was about 10, and, ah we went to this wedding and it has like 200 people.<n>My uncle, he's a great guy.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
and the reason it was bottoms up was because, was, they serve champagne to everybody in these weddings that's something I can never figure out and if you're a kid you get champagne, if you're an adult you get champagne.<n>Everybody gets champagne and some people don't drink it so what's left the kids drink so we were going around drinking all this champagne.<n>And before you know it it's time for the kids Hula Hoop contest and they've got a stage of course there they do it's one of those huge areas and ah we get up there and they're playing this tune I can't remember what it was and Tim and I were up there and Tim my 10 year old cousin is really drunk and he fell completely off the stage I remember that being somewhat embarrassing but looking back on it I think it's really pretty funny, um, it was uh it was a really neat experience.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
So anyhow, I think I spoke to Ramona again.<n>No, it was just that one time in the morning, and she said that she was going to come back to the office.<n>Well, I wasn't even thinking about that, but I was so frustrated, and, I ended up talking to him again.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
He didn't say a time again, so he just got me over there stressing out, and I really don't even know when it's needed.<n>But I was like, forget it, I'm going to eat lunch I was hungry.<n>Usually you feel like you have to work through, like you just have to keep working because he needs it even though it wasn't your fault that he gave it to you at the very last minute, you know, I was like ( ), and then Lana calls me in the kitchen telling me Ramona had gotten here and I didn't even know she was coming for sure.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
And then I heard him leave, so I'm still finishing what I had to do.<n>And here I am thinking he's going come in there and be like, you know, just have it out with me, you know, just tell me off like how could I not have this done.<n>Even though I don't see how he could have expected me to have it done.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
And I was like, "I'm almost done."<n>He was like, "All right, well I'm going go out and run some errands, and um, just put it up on my shelf, and um, if I have any review notes I'll give them to you in the morning.<n>And I was like "OK," and that was it!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
Is it like that all the time?<n>Yep whenever he there, um, which he's not there he's there most of the time but he is gone a lot but whenever he is there, and especially if he gives you something to do it's like you don't even want it because you know it's going to be that way and it's like other people hesitate to come through because they don't want to have said something wrong and then you go back to him well like, you know, such and such helped me and it's not like you're ratting anybody out you're just saying you know such and such helped me and that's how I got to this number but it's like people are hesitating basically and it's really frustrating.<n>So what is it that they wanted you to do?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
We were doing, um<n>, we were doing today it was, um projections it was financial statement like balance sheet and income statement projections for a company that, um, this guy was looking to buy, well he gave us the information that he had projected numbers for 2002- 2003 and we had to put those numbers into financial statements, basically saying they are going to have this much, um, this many assets and liabilities at the end of 2002 going to have 2003 and then going to have so much income, and you know, like that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt

He didn't know how to get in touch with them, and he said, you know, you know, as he grew up, you know, he kept thinking about them, and he said he wanted to come back home but he didn't have any way, he didn't have any money.<n>And he said finally he know, you know, once he got grown and started working, he saved up his money and he said he was determined to come back and find them, and he didn't even know if they were going to be in the same place\\.<n>Wow.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt

Her sister could pass for white, and in fact did pass for white.<n>And Granny used to tell the story about how her sister and her sister's husband decided that they were going to move to the city, to Augusta, and pass for white.<n>And they moved downtown--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt
And they found this house or this apartment building or whatever it was that they could live in, and it was right on the edge of Broad Street.<n>And, uh, they kind of actually stopped visiting the family because they were just, just determined that they were going to be white.<n>They just didn't like what it was like being black in those days, and that was, you know, I guess, that, that was probably, you know, in the early 1930s, uh, when they did that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt
Than the ones who were lighter.<n>And actually when we, we kind of began to understand what was going on because my cousins were a little lighter, well they were somewhat lighter than we were, and she would not treat them well and we couldn't figure it out, what, what was going on, you know, why you know, we could get anything we wanted and she was very stern with them.<n>And, uh, my mother eventually told us, you know, "Well, she has this thing<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt
, he was a minister's son, so he had, they had property, and stuff, and they were very well-connected in the community and very, held in high esteem.<n>His father was like, uh, the guy who had been pastor of this big church for a long period of time and, and, and so I think her family, the Tates, really wanted to connect with the Keenes for that reason, and so they just really just told her she was going to be marrying him.<n>And, she didn't really understand.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt

The rest of us after, uh, after we got the trigger out, why we, uh, would bale out of the aircraft, regardless whether if it was water, over land, air or what, but the bottom did go in.<n>I want to say that there wasn't any danger of going in with the bomb because it would not explode, regardless of how hard it hit the ground.<n>Even if the aircraft was on fire, why it, it would uh, burn and it would melt through a lead component for the radiation to leak out.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
It's a little screw which set an injection but the, the breathing pressure tube to the pilot and counter pressure.<n>Each pilot has a different breathing capacity and we would have to, uh, uh, bend then individual over in the pressure suit uh, uh, I'd have to have to set it for, uh, a second, or which was going through school.<n>Then he'd dress me, and, uh, he'd set the injection on me and you, uh, uh, we'd have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then we'd come up breathing as hard as we could, and you better if uh, the, the, the top portion of your helmet surged, which you had rubber around the neck and the visor closed.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Then he'd dress me, and, uh, he'd set the injection on me and you, uh, uh, we'd have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then we'd come up breathing as hard as we could, and you better if uh, the, the, the top portion of your helmet surged, which you had rubber around the neck and the visor closed.<n>And, uh, if it surged and just kept surging it would go 'whish,' and, like it was going to pull your head off.<n>You'd better get the little screw turned down a little bit because you could damage and individual's lungs very easily.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
And, uh, but, uh, I would think, at night I couldn't sleep.<n>I would think, "Well, I'm, I'm going to let somebody else go," but then I would think, "My God!<n>They've, they chosen me over about 15 individuals there, to go to through that school and I'm not, I'm not.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
This was the first time that, that had happened in 75 years, that TX legislature had voted a military unit being TX Ambassadors, so, needed TX Ambassadors.<n>Late 1962, uh, I got orders to go to Washington, D.C. I didn't know what I was going for or anything, so was to report to a designated place in Washington.<n>Uh, I went ahead up and it was highly classified, even my orders were classified.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
I, I just didn't I was just puzzled.<n>Of course I came back, after a week, to Laughlin Air Force base, and then shortly thereafter I got orders I could bring my family and everything to Las Vegas, NV and I couldn't tell my wife or anything about why I was going there because I didn't know.<n>And so, we moved to Las Vegas, NV, and I reported, just like I did in Washington, to a certain address in downtown Las Vegas.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
They told me that, uh, that I would be called in a guy at the end for me to meet.<n>It was another GI and said I would go with him on Monday morning to a certain location, and we never was for many, many years, we could not even mention the location, but now I have the declassification of it, Roadrunner's International right there in it's authorized, and it tells all about the A-12 Blackbird crew that I was going to in early 1963 and I guess it was the most classified thing that there was at that time in the United States but when I got out and gone out found out what was going into and I looked at one of those birds, there was actually bile come into my mouth.<n>Now that's how, uh, I stay buckled in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Where, I didn't know what the code was, but, of course, I'd take it and turn it in to individuals back at life support but I know that I have measured them and they told me he had 300 degrees on the top of his head.<n>But you have to remember, he had a tremendous cooling system going in to his full pressure suit and going out to the inside of his hands channels and then down to his feet he's got channels pumping cold air down there all the time and then comes back and exhausts out the outside of the control.<n>There's so much you could talk about on that I'll just skip that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
All of our pilots flew on radio silence, period.<n>And, of course, they were going so fast they couldn't move up and down but evidently they got, uh, word back real quickly by mashing the scrambler, a button on the inside of the aircraft.<n>I don't know that; I never was told that, but CIA got the word quick like that, but they never could shoot him down anyway, and they have never, never.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Well, Alex, the youngest, of course he's just so sick of being in this truck, he says, "Get me out of here," you know, just, "Let me out!"<n>I say, "OK, everybody, we're going to get out of the truck, we're going to kind of look around, we'll do some stuff, and then, we'll probably eat breakfast, and then we'll go or, ea, we had our little bag lunches, and then we'll go down to the lake.<n>And, uh, we get out of the truck, and we walk about ten feet, and I, I was like, walking over logs and trying to get over to a fairly clear area, and all of a sudden, Alex just goes, "Snake!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt

You guys can go, go down to the lake, just be careful."<n>And, uh, so they kind of walked over to the hill, kind of started walking down, and at a point they just had to sit on their butts and kind of slide down, and the trees were all cut, so they'd grab trees as they were going down.<n>And, um, I was just watching them, and I was up at the top, and then, I started down, I'd figured, let them go first, then I'd, I'd go kind of behind them.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt
I mean, the hill's, no human being could catch<n>that kind of momentum without gravity pulling him down, and he starts running, and he's running, and you could just see, it was like, there's no way he's going to recover from this.<n>And he's running, trying to keep up with gravity, so he's going down this hill, and literally, falling down the hill, but instead of falling down, he's running!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt

And<n>what scared me the most was when he said before he put the I.V. in my arm, before he did, say before he did surgery, before he was going to do the surgery, he said, "OK uh, let's have a word of prayer."<n>Yeah I was like OK, please.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt

Um, my husband and I both tend to be very critical when it comes to story lines and stuff like that.<n>And while we're watching something, I'll say, "OK honey, what's going to happen next?"<n>Or I'll tell him what I think is going to happen next.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
And while we're watching something, I'll say, "OK honey, what's going to happen next?"<n>Or I'll tell him what I think is going to happen next.<n>And if the way that the plot is, um, constructed, if they've got like loopholes, or got, if it's a non-sequitur.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
I really don't want to, um, watch that show any more!<n>So it basically, uh, turns you from the, um, plot instead of going with the plot.<n>It just turns you away from it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
And my family is chomping-at-the-bit ready for me!<n>"When are you going to publish?"<n>And when it's ready, it'll be ready, and I really can't rush that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
I wasn't so much even, I, I did not even know how to, I wish I could put my hands on it.<n>If I had of thought about it, I had no clue that we were even going to talk about him.<n>I think, where in the world do I have that?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
For the most part I think it's pretty clean and that's something else I really appreciate, is, when I don't have to do deal with a lot of profanity or unwholesomeness.<n>You know, there is so much that you can write about that's good and wholesome and intriguing without going into the areas that are unprofitable that, um, and I don't, I haven't read The Foundation again in, like, probably the last five years, but, um, periodically I'll feel like, "I've got to visit this book again!"<n>So, you don't mind re-reading?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
But, um, it's, um, and I'm trying to think the theater uh, other than Fiddler on the Roof, of course I haven't seen a lot of different things, but, um, has not had the same level of impact, I guess.<n>Uh, uh, going to see The Fiddler on the Roof, of course, as a violinist, that, you know, was part of our, our class, um, project, and that was part of our appreciation.<n>They also had a full orchestra.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
"That's not how it should have ended!"<n>Not that everything has to have a happy ending, it just has to have a, a Bible solution of, one of the things going back to The Foundation Trilogy, in their closing chap, chapters, well, it's like two chapters that end the book.<n>The chapter before the last chapter is, is titled, "The Answer That Satisfies".<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
I appreciate not having to deal with vulgarity.<n>I mean, you can, you can be realistic without going into great detail.<n>I think about the ugliness of life.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
So I'm familiar with that particular book.<n>Um, in your high school years, you're going back to that time period and your librarian was one that you said who encouraged you and you had some challenges between each other in writing poetry--<n>Um-hum.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt

That Anne and I split up when she died.<n>She didn't specify who would get what, and when she died and the time came to settle up stuff, Mom said, "Ok, how are you and Anne going to do this?"<n>And so we said, "We'll flip a coin and see who goes first."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
Because I know my Granny grew up in Cabarrus County on a farm and was one of three or four kids, and she inherited her father's mother for a season out of every year.<n>Poor old woman would come all wrapped up in layers of clothes, and my mother told me this not long before she died, but she said when she was little she remembered her granny showing up and her mother saying, "The first thing I'm going to do is unwrap this cocoon."<n>She wouldn't have changed her clothes since the last time Granny had seen her probably--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt

Um, she had very big dreams of wanting to become a lawyer one day.<n>Um, she, was, at the time, there was a lot of racial tension that was going on, so she felt like she wouldn't be able to make it.<n>She was kind of confused of what background she wanted to u-, what ethnic background she wanted to use, so she decided to use her black heritage, um background.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HicksDebra.txt
And so she moved to New York and she went to school there, she made it through school and she did become a attorney.<n>She later was going through problems because they found out that she was a black ethnic and not white, so they would, she could no longer work with the firm.<n>Um, they had no sufficient reason as to why they wanted to cancel, didn't want her to be, um, the attorney.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HicksDebra.txt

Um, some remembrances of growing up in the Charlotte area.<n>Um, I'm going to share a few little stories I remember, uh, happened at Christmas time.<n>I remember my dad telling a funny story about my brother, my oldest brother, and they had purchased this huge like little general store type thing that had all these, um, boxes and cartons and stuff that you would put together, and, um, it was actually like a little store-front thing.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt
or something.<n>And, um, so, of course, a three-year-old is not going to stay right anywhere and I just kind of, you know, wandered down the aisle looking at something else or I may have turned the corner, I don't remember.<n>And, of course, you know, after whatever it was lost interest for me I looked up.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt
before I would go anywhere with my dad again ever.<n>I mean I was just convinced he was going to lose me and every time he would ask me to go somewhere I would be like, "No you're going to lose me again," and, you know, it was just the longest time before I ever trusted him enough to even go anywhere with him.<n>Um, and, I think that's most of like the little funny stories that I can remember.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt
Testing, one, two, three, four.<n>I'm here with Sean Jamieson he's going to be the third subject and I'm just making sure this recorder's working good.<n>OK we're here with Sean Jamieson he is the third subject here in the, um, project and Sean is from Chicago originally.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt

Every year, yeah we do a reunion every year.<n>And it was, was my, my aunt who owned my Aunt Pat who had the, ah, my grandparents' old house, who was instrumental in getting these started and keeping them going because she realized she told me this just within the last couple of years that she thought it was very important to have the reunions every year so the family would stay in touch with each other cause otherwise I would never have known my cousins because the only things we might have gotten together for would be maybe at weddings and funerals which are not good opportunities to do much mixing and mingling because there are other things on the agenda.<n>At a wedding or a funeral it's really hard to catch up with people.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt
So my aunt had been, had been real smart about, about scheduling those every year and trying to get as many people there as possible so that we all, ah, kept in touch and we all know who our cousins and our relatives were.<n>So who's going to, ah, start doing that, who's going to be coordinating that now that she's?<n>Ah, one of my cousins apparently is, well, two of my cousins are, are keeping it going in fact.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt
So who's going to, ah, start doing that, who's going to be coordinating that now that she's?<n>Ah, one of my cousins apparently is, well, two of my cousins are, are keeping it going in fact.<n>I just had a phone message tonight from my dad saying that the date has been set for this August on the reunion and, ah, it's not clear who's going to host it but, ah, there's still quite a large group of family members in this city of Guelph and somebody is going to end up hosting it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt
Ah, one of my cousins apparently is, well, two of my cousins are, are keeping it going in fact.<n>I just had a phone message tonight from my dad saying that the date has been set for this August on the reunion and, ah, it's not clear who's going to host it but, ah, there's still quite a large group of family members in this city of Guelph and somebody is going to end up hosting it.<n>Ah, the reason that, one of the reasons my Aunt Pat was always good at being the hostess for it is that the family had, there are two small houses on four big lots on this dead-end street, so there was a lot of room for everybody to kind of spread out, put up a couple of tents or shelters or whatever, have barbecue grills out there, and, uh, a couple of houses to run in and use the bathroom, whatever, so there's just a lot of room and, uh, but it's not clear if that house is going to be sold or not now that my aunt has, ah, passed away.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt

Uh-huh.<n>And then, ah, I guess the family reunion is, when is the next one you're going to go to?<n>It's August 12th of this year, August 12th of 2000, and, uh, don't know, don't know too many more details about it and don't know if I'll be able to go.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt
It sounds simple breaking your hip but you just, it is, I, I'm sure, you know, older people who've had that happen to them, you get into the hospital and you end up catching an infection or something like that from somebody else and your immune system is kind of weakened and she just, um, um, didn't make it unfortunately.<n>It sounds like a big loss for the community just because there was so many people and she organized the family reunions but you know at least you know you've got somebody that's going to take over and start putting that back together there.<n>Yeah but Aunt Pat was definitely the matriarch of the family.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt
The bumper cars were a blast.<n>We kept stalling and bumping and going around in circles, and we just had a wonderful time on the bumper cars<n>.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt

And then he goes, he starts going 65 as we, as we cross over Conference.<n>And so I'm going 65.<n>And, um, I got on the radio with Charlotte thinking he might be impaired or you know, drunk or something like that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt
So I try to get in, get on the, the radio with Charlotte.<n>And as I'm going down the road 65 miles an hour I see the Charlotte police officer on the right hand side sitting in front of, uh, um, that shopping area right, right prior to Conference.<n>Is that where the Harris-Teeter's at?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt

Her name was Crystal.<n>And so, um, we met in FL, and in Boca Raton and we stayed with my grandparents, and we would stay with my grandparents for at least one night, uh Boca Raton, and then the rest of the week we spent in Fort Lauderdale because my grandfather owned a hotel called The Sanddollar in a place called Lauderdale by the Sea, um, in Fort Lauderdale, and it was fantastic time and when we had the chance to spend time together and just go out on the beach and at night we would go out to dinner I remember going to a Benihana Japanese steakhouse, and we just felt like we had freedom, and then we weren't yet 21 so we weren't allowed to go to clubs in Fort Lauderdale, so we basically spent our time, uh, watching movies in the hotel room or just walking along the strip and I remember going out for ice cream one night and just walking along the boardwalk it was very, very peaceful time, and the worst part of the vacation was getting sunburned, um, because I'm extremely pale, and going out on the beach<n>everyday for hours on end turned me into a lobster, and, um, my friend Crystal would always joke with me and call me, um, her lobster.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt
The meager looking pieces.<n>So my mother use to sit back in her chair in the den and talk about how one Saturday Granny, uh, had decided she was going to go to town and you know back then, you're talking, oh probably 1930s, early 1930s, uh, my mother would've been 10 or 12, somewhere around there, and Granny, uh, went to the train track to get on the little trolley train, whatever they had at that time to come downtown.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LeakJeffrey.txt
Now bear in mind that I told you Granny moved in with us, um, towards the later years of her life, and when she moved in with us I was in the 10th grade, so I was just starting high school.<n>Um, you know, going through puberty and dating and playing basketball and stuff like that.<n>That, that was my favorite sport.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LeakJeffrey.txt

Needless to say, my nephews and I were quite embarrassed and didn't want to be there.<n>But they were just convinced that they were getting ready to just ruin our lives, but some women were going get us to do some stuff they didn't need to do and we were going be some baby's daddy, and Lord, and that's my story in terms of, um, um, something we still laugh about my sister and I, yeah.<n>Thank you<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LeakJeffrey.txt

To give you a little bit of brief history, I came out of the 80s like a lot of people did, kind of floundering, trying to figure out some new directions.<n>I'd been through a lot of violent up and down swings and created peaks and valleys in my financial life and emotional life, and, course I'm sure my, my mental frame, but everything settled down and I was going along, had a good job, was dating a lady.<n>Just enjoying life in general, had a wonderful relationship with my two precious daughters.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt

Oh yeah, oh yeah!<n>So I pull in and he gets, he starts, "We're going to do the inspection first."<n>So here he comes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
He said, "I, it's not real bad right now but if it gets worse it could.<n>If it goes your car is going to just stop running."<n>So I was like well, I'll let my dad handle that over Christmas, I'll be home `fore I know it, you know.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
.<n>I say, "Well I want you to know that I just drove 15 minutes to get here and didn't go to my normal place, where I know the people because of this huge great deal y'all have going on," you know?<n>And he goes, "Oh no, no, no, no, no.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
I said, "Well I hate to tell you.<n>Not on Saturdays you ain't going to get your tires rotated."<n>"What?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
He said, "I normally go to this other place."<n>And I said, "Well they're not going to do it."<n>He said, "Well screw it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
I said, "15 dollars."<n>He's like, "Well I'm not going to leave.<n>They've already got my car up on the thing.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
I'll just pay it."<n>He's like, "That's," you know, "I'm going to say something to them."<n>He's like, "That's just screwed up."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
He's like, "That's just screwed up."<n>And, um, so anyways, were talking about it and I was telling him how he kept coming in about the blades and the fan belt and he said, "Yeah, they're out, they're going to do that tell them not to worry about anything."<n>So there comes the little man.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
It's almost to break, and my manager said, `do not do it, do not do it, do not do it,' so I put your tires back on<n>and I am not going to rotate your tires.<n>I am very frustrated with this lug."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
He's got the lug.<n>Yeah so he goes, "I'm going to break it, if I try to put back in I'm going to break it."<n>And I said, "OK."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
And I said, "OK."<n>He said, "I'm going to try.<n>I'm just telling you, you tell your father that I did not break this it was already broken."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
Ten minutes later, I mean I was there for like an hour or so.<n>He said, oh I said, "How long is it going to take, because I wanted to get my book out of the car if I need to take to read."<n>"Oh no, not long at all.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
So I put it in my pocketbook.<n>I'm like, so I'm just going to drive without a lug in my tire.<n>He's like, "You have five other ones, you'll be fine.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
I pull this out I said, "So when I called the other day," I said, "they told me 25.99, if you want the free tire rotation, 18.99, if you don't, you just get the oil change."<n>I said, "First of all," I said, "I wasn't going to get a free oil, free tire rotation to begin with, so I shouldn't have been charged, and not even 25.99, 27.99."<n>I said, "I shouldn't have even been charged that to begin with."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
I said, "Then, he didn't get my lug nut back on," I said, "so I didn't get the tire rotation and I have a broken lug nut."<n>I said, "And then, you're still going to charge me 26.99?"<n>I said, "No way."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
I said, "No way."<n>I said, "What is going on here, I don't you know.<n>I'm not happy with what's going on."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
I said, "What is going on here, I don't you know.<n>I'm not happy with what's going on."<n>You know, I'm getting mad.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
\\He was livid.<n>\\ MH: Is he going to call?<n>He was like, I mean he ain't going to call but he was like, first off he was mad about the inspection being 20 dollars.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
\\ MH: Is he going to call?<n>He was like, I mean he ain't going to call but he was like, first off he was mad about the inspection being 20 dollars.<n>He was like, he said, "You shouldn't have, yeah, you shouldn't have done it."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
"What do we need the money for?<n>How is it going to be spent?"<n>She genuinely--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt
She was a voter.<n>Although she was 92 or 93 at the time, she was going to get in her car and go vote one way or the other.<n>And so, I would try to explain to her how it was very important, with all the growth we were experiencing in Cabarrus County, to keep the, uh, the number of kids in the classrooms to less than 30 if we could, and we weren't meeting that with the growth.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt
Matthew Purdie.<n>I've been asked to recount the story of how I first came to be going out with my present girlfriend, who, more than likely, I will end up marrying in year and a half or so.<n>Well the story goes something like this: Late November, early December, don't remember which, 1990, 1990 I had a dream.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt
And, we discussed it, and he said, "Wow!"<n>And I said, "Jeffrey, I'm probably going to marry this girl."<n>And, well, that was like nine years ago.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt
And we had a very, very, we went to the prom together.<n>Then, sometime in June or July, after we graduated, we had a really long talk about what we were going to do because we were going to different colleges.<n>What schools were you going to?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt
Then, sometime in June or July, after we graduated, we had a really long talk about what we were going to do because we were going to different colleges.<n>What schools were you going to?<n>I went to NC State University in Raleigh, NC, she went to Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt
Well, low and behold, that never happened for either one of us.<n>And we made it, all through six years of college, together, discussing quite often whether or not we were going to end up marrying each other.<n>And while, she ended up taking a job in Atlanta, which was a little bit further from Charlotte than Winston-Salem was, and she wanted me to move down there.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt
She thought that.<n>But anyway, she, is probably going to move back here and we will probably get married, and have kids, and live the happily ever after Cinderella little story because I am Prince Charming and she is, the Princess.<n>What other story shall I tell?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt
Um, and you look at other kinds of things and I think Charlotte, and maybe it's typical of the South, but I think that, uh, maybe there hasn't been as much growth here before and when you have growth and you have people coming in, who, looking for services.<n>And you, and you also have a, a government, um, who are, are really ready to take that challenge as opposed to just deciding that, "Hey, listen we're gonna do things the way we've done it for the last, you know, 100 years, whether new people come or need services or ask for amenities or not, we're going to keep things the way they are."<n>In fact, the town of Matthews, I think, um, at least my understanding is, is that when Providence Plantation, uh, reached a certain point in population they, they wanted to be annexed to the town of Matthews because they thought maybe that the city of Charlotte would annex them and so they wanted to, that they petitioned the town of Matthews to annex.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt
My father lives in Queens, NY, off of Throgs Neck Bridge in Bayside, and my mother lives in the Poconos, which is known as Stroudsburg, PA.<n>I've been down here now, I would say, oh about seven, seven years now, going on eight years.<n>I came down here originally on a, to play baseball in the Charlotte area at, uh, one of the colleges here in Charlotte.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt
Well, at least for a while I was.<n>I'm presently going to be going on my way out to Denver, CO for a job opportunity.<n>But, um, the reason, uh, I guess I came down here again was to play baseball.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt
She's a religious background, religious background upbringing, which I cannot say I've been a part of.<n>And, um, she's going to calm me down a lot I think and, uh, instill a lot of, instill a lot of positive aspects of my life that have thus far been deferred.<n>How did you meet her?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt
It's getting brighter and brighter, it seems, every day.<n>And, um, it's going to be a new adventure for us going out to Denver, CO, with me being a pharmaceutical sales representative and my fianc�e being in the medical profession as well, being a nurse.<n>And, um--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt
So, uh, yeah.<n>I'll definitely want them to pursue baseball, but, by all means, it's probably going to be whatever they want to do.<n>I don't want to force them or anything so--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt
So, it seemed like a really good place to come to, and so far I really like it.<n>Um, I'm going to tell you a story about a trip I took with my sisters.<n>Um, I have four sisters and we're all about a year and a half apart and we're going to visit my grandmother who lives in Cape Coral, in Florida.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt
Um, I'm going to tell you a story about a trip I took with my sisters.<n>Um, I have four sisters and we're all about a year and a half apart and we're going to visit my grandmother who lives in Cape Coral, in Florida.<n>So, I think it was maybe four years ago, four, four, or five years ago and um, we left, actually just three of my sisters and I went.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt
this guy was crazy, this cop, he said that we were in a really bad section of where people were like murdered and killed and like thrown like behind like the rest stop.<n>So my sisters are sitting on the curb thinking, "Oh, my God, we're going to die, right?"<n>And not to mention it's getting later in the day and it was about, I think it was late March, early April, it had to be.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt
And not to mention it's getting later in the day and it was about, I think it was late March, early April, it had to be.<n>But anyways, so the sun had started descending, going down.<n>Anyways, this guy comes and he fix, he must have left about four times, I don't know where he was going, but I don't know where his shop was, but every time he comes back with some crazy thing and he eventually fixed our car with some uh, chicken wire, I think he rigged it up with.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt
Anyways, we got in the car and it got us to Savannah, GA.<n>And we arrived in Savannah, um, it was Mardi Gras, was it Mar, no it was St. Patrick's Day and let me tell you there were some crazy things going on.<n>The woman, the desk attendant, the hotel we checked in well, first we couldn't find any hotels, because it was booked, apparently Savannah is like really crazy around St. Patrick's Day.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt
Um, and then we went to, let's see For, I want to say it's Fort Myers Beach I think, the beach is on the West Coast, we went down, it's about an hour from my grandma's and uh, it's a really nice beach, it's uh, was pretty warm that day.<n>I think, we all got some color, but they were having an epidemic of red tide and so all the fish were washing up on the shore and um, luck be it, since we were having such a good time um, Allison, Nancy, and I decide we are going to take a walk along the beach and there were fish strewn everywhere so we were careful not to step on them.<n>However, Allison wasn't paying attention and she stepped on a fish and it got a barb, which is one of it's defense mechanisms, stuck in her foot, so it was really painful and her foot swelled up and everything.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt
What's his favorite?<n>Um, he doesn't really have a favorite; he picks whichever one is going that night.<n>He just got a book it's called, um, Eagle Boy, and it's about a, um, a Indian tribe on the CA coast, who does, uh, they run out of food in the area where they are.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt
Just anything to get out of doing my job.<n>So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow, do what she tell told me to do, she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family.<n>So she began to tell this story.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
I don't feel good."<n>The little girl disappointed her mother so badly, but her mother said, "How in the world am I ever going to get her to wash these dishes?"<n>So she said, "Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
The little girl disappointed her mother so badly, but her mother said, "How in the world am I ever going to get her to wash these dishes?"<n>So she said, "Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you."<n>So the little girl just said, "OK I'll go in there and wash the dishes."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
It's always been my dream that my children all go to school.<n>But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money."<n>At that time my dad was in prison at the time, so it made it really hard for my mom.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
Yes, my brother went to school.<n>He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and going to school too.<n>So he graduated from, um, Johnson C. Smith, here in Charlotte.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
I think that was the last class I took.<n>My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school.<n>But you would have been able to be a, a teacher if you had continued?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband.<n>After all of this was, after I, I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of going back to school.<n>I just got to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never went back.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
My name is Bonnie Rindner and I was born in San Antonio, TX, and the story I'm going to tell is about my mother.<n>Um, a little background first.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RindnerBonnie.txt
She is Japanese-American.<n>She has lived in the Charlotte area for 13 years, and she is going to talk about growing up Japanese-American in West Virginia.<n>Um, when I grew up in West Virginia, um, it was like it was backwards compared to the Charlotte area.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
And, uh, she looked up and could see the bombs and everything.<n>And she remembers being scared and thinking that she was going to die, and she said it was just one of the hardest times of her life.<n>That, but, uh, they made it through that, and um, she really never showed any bitterness or anything towards American people, but, uh, she was always just grateful for her life.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
How did your parents meet?<n>They met, my, my mother was going to Tokyo University in Tokyo and working part-time at a china factory, and my father had gone there to buy some china for his mother, and, uh, he met my mother and just fell head over heels in love.<n>And she thought he was a crazy<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
Not, um, right off.<n>I know the story he tells about, well he's always telling about going to play music and how they'd play when he was young.<n>So can you think of a story?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
He's always got a story to tell, regardless if he sees you or if it's a family gathering.<n>He's got, you know, he's going to be the one that's got, the one who is keeping the crowd up, or, or, you know, just being himself.<n>What about you?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
So I think I'd probably be a little bit of him, yet a little bit of everybody else, and I'm not really one to steal the, steal the show at gatherings or what have you.<n>If you were going to tell a story to your kids about your childhood, what story would you tell?<n>It would probably all be sports related stories, um, because sports to me has been such a big factor in my life whether it teaches you the value of competition or the value of sportsmanship or the learning from mistakes of, um, in sports you are sometimes forced to make quick decisions and sometimes those decisions are not necessarily the right ones.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
The team from the northern part of our county, North Stokes and we were the southern part, South Stokes.<n>And, uh, they had one pitcher in particular who didn't like us and he was scheduled to pitch that night and after I had been hit the third time and my best friend had been hit the second time, we kind of decided that we were going take it upon ourselves to hit back.<n>Only not with baseballs but with fists, so we charged the mound.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
Um, so, you know, things like that are learning experiences where you learn to grow up and mature.<n>So what you going to tell your kid if someone from away hits them three times with a baseball?<n>Charge the mound?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
Um, I was decent I guess.<n>So is that going to be the sport you push on our kid?<n>I'm probably not going to push any sport on our kid, my kid, although I have always said when I was in college and, right after I gave up my sports career, I always said my kid, I'm going to teach him more and work with him all the time.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
So is that going to be the sport you push on our kid?<n>I'm probably not going to push any sport on our kid, my kid, although I have always said when I was in college and, right after I gave up my sports career, I always said my kid, I'm going to teach him more and work with him all the time.<n>But as I've grown older and matured I've decided I'm going to let my kid be who he wants to be.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
I'm probably not going to push any sport on our kid, my kid, although I have always said when I was in college and, right after I gave up my sports career, I always said my kid, I'm going to teach him more and work with him all the time.<n>But as I've grown older and matured I've decided I'm going to let my kid be who he wants to be.<n>So if we have a-<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
Especially when we first started dating and you didn't necessarily have the most reliable car of the people in NC.<n>Your little wrecked `84 Honda Accord wasn't necessarily the thing you were going to drive two hours away, especially two hours to come and see me.<n>But, um, one of the things I remember was you putting it, putting yourself getting in trouble, and really probably wasn't one of the wisest things we have ever done.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
I just remember you coming up and that was one of the best times we have had.<n>And of course one of the things I remember most was going out to the Farmhouse which was our first official, unofficial date.<n>And by our first official, unofficial date, should I go into that, too?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
Morgy!<n>And, um, so we ended up going out but I didn't have any idea that you did have a boyfriend!<n>But I told them to tell!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
And during the summer when we were home from school, and I was five or six years old when they were both still home.<n>She was responsible for making sure the house got clean and the chores got done and to make sure we played a part in that, and of course she was going to make sure we did our part.<n>So she was the biggest slave driver I've ever seen, and my brother was always the rebel, and I, you know, as a five or six year old, I did what I could and she didn't really have a lot of trouble with me, but with my brother being, when she was 16 he was 12 so you can imagine what kind of battles they had.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
Um, because I ended up making a lot of good friends and, um, really loving the part of town that I moved to and really adapting to, um, my community there, um, and getting involved.<n>And actually, the friends that I made there are the ones I ended up going to college with and not the ones from my first high school.<n>Right.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt
They didn't like me<n>at first `cause I was the new girl and where, you know, most of the guys, if a new girl comes in, of course they're going to be friendly just because<n>it's new blood or whatever.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt
And one of them was that one time I wanted something on top of the bed that couldn't reach and so you said, my mom said to get, to find a way to get it, and so I don't remember what I grabbed, but I grabbed something and I climbed on top of the bed and I grabbed the thing that I wanted and I think they were like surprised because they didn't think that I would actually do it.<n>Another one was when I think I was younger than that I was trying to climb up on a couch and my grandfather was like watching me behind me and he kept saying to everybody, "she's going to fall, she's going to fall, she's going to fall, she fell," because I did fall and everybody laughed and I think they took a picture of me when I was like climbing up the couch or whenever I was on that couch.<n>But they sort of told me that from climbing all over the couches, I sort of ruined them.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaCaroline.txt
My mom told me stories.<n>She would make up stories for us, my sister and I, at bedtime when we lived in Miami and she would tell us stories like, including like characters that were like us but we had different names and stuff, or we would be animals and they would have morals to them at the end and, or we would read books at night before going to bed.<n>So this was in your bedroom?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaIvonne.txt
Uh, the books were always available to them.<n>I read to them at bedtime uh, in their beds, other times they sat in my lap during the day, um, like going over the pictures, the sounds and the tone of voice, uh, through me, um, as to what the character was feeling, scared, happy, angry.<n>When I felt like it um, it would be effective and my children's behavior said, "They were really into this story," at that point then I would add my own words and make up more of what had caught their interest.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SmithPatricia.txt
Um, my very favorite book is God on a Harley.<n>Um, it, through that book it was me going through all the same experiences as the author and I saw more clearly what I needed to do.<n>OK, well thanks Pat.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SmithPatricia.txt
So, um, there was, at the end of the sports season, the fall sport season and the spring sport season, at South Mecklenburg there was always, a what they called, a banquet and they didn't serve any food, but for some reason they called it a banquet.<n>They had all the children, the students from the fall sports up on the stage to be introduced, get whatever recognition were appropriate, and, um, there was going to be one in early December of 1995.<n>And, uh, that was when it was decided since I was going to be there, because Michaela played tennis in the fall, and Mr. Speckman was going to be there, since Ryan and Eric played soccer in the fall that was when this meeting would take place.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
They had all the children, the students from the fall sports up on the stage to be introduced, get whatever recognition were appropriate, and, um, there was going to be one in early December of 1995.<n>And, uh, that was when it was decided since I was going to be there, because Michaela played tennis in the fall, and Mr. Speckman was going to be there, since Ryan and Eric played soccer in the fall that was when this meeting would take place.<n>So in order to make sure that I would be there one of the Quail Girls, who lived right around the corner from the Speckmans, said she would come and she would pick me up.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
They said, this is, uh, Wendy's mother said to me, "Oh!<n>You're going to meet John Speckman!<n>Whew!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
So all the Quail Girls and I were together and we were having punch and cake or whatever, and the guys and Mr. Speckman were over kind of in another area.<n>So, uh, you know, Wendy was saying, "How are we going to do this?<n>How are we going to do this?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
So, uh, you know, Wendy was saying, "How are we going to do this?<n>How are we going to do this?"<n>And I said, "Well, you know, if it happens, it happens.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
And I said, "You're kidding!"<n>And she said, "Are you going to call him?<n>Are you going to call him?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
And she said, "Are you going to call him?<n>Are you going to call him?<n>Are you going to call him?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
Are you going to call him?<n>Are you going to call him?"<n>So I said, "Yeah I'll call him."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
So I called him back and we arranged to have dinner on that following Friday.<n>So I called and talked to Michaela and I said, "Well we're going out to eat."<n>And she said, "I knew it!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
Ryan came up to me at school and he said, `He called her!<n>I think they're going to go out!<n>' " And apparently another one of the Quail Girls worked at Boston Market and some of the boys who were in Ryan's group crossed the serving line and said, "He called her and he's going to ask her out!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
I think they're going to go out!<n>' " And apparently another one of the Quail Girls worked at Boston Market and some of the boys who were in Ryan's group crossed the serving line and said, "He called her and he's going to ask her out!"<n>So everybody knew before I knew that he called me and was going to ask me out!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt

So everybody's eager to find out what's happening on this date.<n>So, um, Michaela was going out and I had instructions to call her as soon as I got home, to beep her as soon as I got home so we could discuss the date.<n>So we went out to dinner at a place where, Mr. Speckman had asked one of his sons' friends where we should go and he said that's where we should go, and so we went there to eat.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt

So Michaela came home and I said, "Guess what?<n>I'm going to McAdenville."<n>And she said, "Oh my God!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
She called Shelle , Shelle was at the house in five minutes!<n>"I can't believe it she's going out with him again!<n>You're going out with him again!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt

OK.<n>My name's Carmen Stack and I'm just going to tell a little bit about myself.<n>Um, I was born in Charlotte, NC and I moved to Monroe, um, which is about forty-five minutes east of Charlotte, um, when I was about three.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt
She's in high school.<n>Her name is Ivy and she's going to turn seventeen in a couple weeks.<n>And my grandmother lives next door and my grandfather works across the street from where we live so, we're all really close and pretty tight and, um, I'm real, I'm closer with my grandmother, um, which is my mom's mother, and, um, we do a lot of stuff together, go shopping, and go to lunch, and stuff everyday.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt
And, um, when I was probably about eight years old my mom and I, um, well we had two dogs, one was a Russian Wolfhound and one was just a little mutt-dog.<n>But, um, we left them there by themselves with, uh, well like a bowl of food out, which usually we don't do, but we were going to go get some lunch and, um, we were gone for probably about twenty minutes.<n>And we came back and, Mongoose was the little one and Tanya was the bigger dog, uh, but when we came back, we saw that Mongoose, uh, was bleeding from her eyes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt
What was your favorite place?<n>Well, we would all, well our favorite place, I mean we were pretty young, so our favorite place was like the Pavilion or going to walk on the strip or something.<n>But, um, we, you know, during the day it was always the beach, going to the beach and playing on the beach, and laying out and then going shopping at the, um, like Broadway at the Beach or, um, Barefoot Landing.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt

She just always wants everything to be at her house and kind of be centered around her.<n>So after she's gone I don't really know what we're going to do.<n>It'll be kind of hard for us.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt
It'll be kind of hard for us.<n>But, ah, she's 74 and she's still going strong but actually yesterday she had a small stroke but she's, she's OK.<n>She's better today.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt
She'll tell you like it is and if you don't like it then that's just too bad.<n>But we've come to realize that's her and that's just the way it's going to have to be.<n>But, um, um, so my next story, I guess I want to talk about, uh, I guess I'll move on to kind of high school era.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt
And, uh, you know, I just kind of, it was Andy's truck and he was driving.<n>And, um, we were going to Lake Twitty, and I kind of just got volunteered into going with everybody.<n>So we were going cat fishing, but, and the guys had some beer.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt
And, um, we were going to Lake Twitty, and I kind of just got volunteered into going with everybody.<n>So we were going cat fishing, but, and the guys had some beer.<n>And, um, so anyway, we were just riding along and we pulled into, uh, and, oh!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt
And then, and then it was always like an adventure though because then all of a sudden, toward the end, like the parents are coming back.<n>And we all know that if we don't have everything cleaned up you're going to get punished.<n>And so it was like, "Can they do it?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt
Can they get cleaned up in time?<n>Are they going to make it?"<n>So it's like having a blast and going on a flight of fancy and then coming back to reality and then like not getting caught<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt
Are they going to make it?"<n>So it's like having a blast and going on a flight of fancy and then coming back to reality and then like not getting caught<n>, kind of.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt
-which usually meant that they weren't being careful.<n>But anyway their stories would go on and on about going one mile an hour up a hill taking forever to get somewhere driving getting up, a head up steam in the winter and Bucking snowdrifts is what they called it.<n>The snowdrifts would come out into the streets into the road and, uh, this was in rural MN, so half the time you couldn't see where the road was anyway but they would go plowing these snowdrifts, you know.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt
And, uh, also the story of Paul, and, in particular, it's in, I think, it's in the Book of Romans, Romans 8:28 where he says, "All things work for good for those who love the Lord."<n>Uh, and Paul, Paul's life is like a Indiana Jones movie, where, at one time, there's 40, 40 Jews, uh, Jewish scholars or whatever had taken the vow of hunger; until they caught him they weren't going to eat.<n>So there's 40 guys who hadn't eaten in 30 days chasing them.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt
So there's 40 guys who hadn't eaten in 30 days chasing them.<n>So you reckon at least one of them is going to catch them somehow but he, he managed to elude them all.<n>And then of course he spent the rest of his life you know on shipwrecks and in jail and being beat up, and, uh, I'm sure verbally abused and just you name it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt
The freedom that we had as children is unheard of today.<n>There was nowhere in town that you couldn't ride on a bicycle or walk, as long as you told your mother where you were going and you were home by dark.<n>I wish that my children, growing up in a different age where they didn't have this kind of safety and where everybody in the town didn't look out for them, could have had this experience of this much freedom.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt
They went to the same church we went to, First Methodist, and they sat on a certain pew and woe be unto the person who sat, that chose to sit on the Lann twins' pew.<n>They watched everybody's coming and going when we, we kids on the street became teenagers.<n>They could tell you who everyone was dating and, if you were a girl, whether or not you got a goodnight kiss under the porch light and probably reported it at every bridge table they sat at for the next several weeks.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt
The first thing one of them asked was, "Kitty's age was not in the newspaper, how old was she?"<n>I said, "Kitty didn't tell her age when she was alive and I just don't think we're going to start now."<n>They were not even put off and did not even slow down.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt
They were not even put off and did not even slow down.<n>The next thing they wanted to know was I going to sell the things in mother's house and how much did I want for the mirror above the fireplace.<n>It, I guess it was somewhat reassuring even then, that it didn't matter that they didn't express sympathy, but that some things never change and always stay the same.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt
My great grandmother, who was in a big wooden wheelchair, paralyzed with arthritis, would go on this camping trip for the whole summer also.<n>Mother and her sister spent their days playing in the woods, wading in the creek, swimming on the scuppernong vines and sometimes picking berries and going fishing.<n>When the rain came my grandfather would tell Mother not to touch the tent with her finger because then the tent would leak so of course Mother would lay on her cot looking up at the tent close to her and touch it with her finger a slow drip would come and Mother would be in trouble but not as much trouble as when she was playing on the muddy creek bank and lost her shoe the only pair she had.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasKay.txt
Growing up, almost everybody went to church and students went with them and it sure didn't make them perfect, but it seem to uh, place some fear in their minds, some people today I think have no fear, even fear of death.<n>They think they're going to come back, it's some temporary vacation and they don't realize when they use violence or they when they overdose how permanent it is.<n>So if we don't, people have different tendency of churches and religions, Judaism, Hinduism, ( ), Christianity and then you have Atheist.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt
It's the home of West Virginia Wesleyan College and that was my playground, that was my own, the place where I spent so much of my childhood playtime and, uh, running through the different buildings and structures of the campus.<n>Uh, having a free reign, going and coming as I pleased almost, because my grandfather was the Dean of the College.<n>And, and everybody knew me so nobody really tried uh, to uh corral me, so I was sort of free to go and do what I wanted, you know when the buildings were open.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt
Someplace like that, that is more south.<n>But, I enjoy WV and I enjoy going back and meeting friends and uh,<n>stirring up memories.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt
But uh, with my last two interviews, but I digress, anyway.<n>( ) Dad, Dad, um, do you remember going to Audra State Park a lot when you were a younger teenager, and if so, what kinds of things would you do there, including snake hunting, drinking of alcohol, etc?<n>Jess, I never hunted snakes because I don't like snakes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt
revolutionary proportions, but why do you identify so much with the Jewish plight portrayed in Fiddler on the Roof?<n>Um, well my favorite part was the two staircases, one going up and one coming down, or there were three actually, one going nowhere, in between.<n>Dad, come on, you're making no sense at all.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt
\\ Do you like computers?<n>I mean you're going to, you are opening a new business-- \\<n>\\ I am computer illiterate, so I don't have a like or dislike for them because I don't know what they can do for me.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt
Some people sell a lot more on the Internet.<n>Do you think that with this business, um, you're going to have to learn how to do it-- \\<n>\\ Sure.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt
\\ Um, we-- \\<n>\\ How much did you say you were going to pay me for this?<n>\\<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt
As a child I loved it, but as I grew up there just really wasn't a whole lot that Buckhannon had to offer other than the fact that, you know, was where my memories of childhood are and my parents.<n>And I like going home to visit my parents and seeing my friends but as far as wanting to live there, I wouldn't.<n>OK, I think y'all have a phone call.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt
They left out of NY and went to Scotland.<n>And, um, he said you would look out if you were up on deck and the waves, the swells were way up higher than, than the boat itself and looked like you were going to drown.<n>But the Queen Mary was right beside to them.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt
I wanted to be a ballerina.<n>The ballerina part never came about, but I, I did go on to college and I, um, transferred a lot and ended up going to a lot of different colleges which was kind of fun.<n>I went to Marshall University, and I went to University of Pittsburgh, and I ended up graduating from West Virginia University with a major in printmaking and a minor in art history and English literature.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt
Especially the anti-religious art.<n>Um-hmm, well art has always been controversial and has always reflected what is going on in the world.<n>You know, and, um, so, you know, having studied art history, that doesn't, it doesn't shock me or surprise me that much.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt
And I, you know, I don't like it, personally, because,<n>you know, it does offend me, what, what I have seen, and I don't like the idea that we are giving the money to create extremely offensive art, but, um, again, that, that's, you know, is, art reflects what's going on and art is, is very spiritual regardless of whether its content says, you know, something about God or not, there, there has a very spiritual quality about it.<n>It's very powerful<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt
I've always been interested.<n>It's a, it was a good way to find out what was going on outside the world that I was living in.<n>So do you remember any particular ones that you really liked, or anyone?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WerthChristopher.txt
So maybe, you know, it was just, you know, you know, when I would physically see her for a while, it was like once a year.<n>But there was never any storytelling going on.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WerthChristopher.txt
And she started, started pulling me or something, I don't remember exactly, so the dogs circled her and snarled and growled at her and she got, backed back into the house.<n>And I wouldn't come in because I knew I was going to get a whipping for climbing up in that tree.<n>And later, I guess I forgot and she knew I would.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt
child?<n>I remember a lot of things I'm just not going to put it on this tape.<n>Then my children will hear it and then try to pull it too.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt
Getting out for the summer.<n>But what I like more now is going to school.<n>That's good.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteJustin.txt
Yep.<n>She's probably going to be my best teacher.<n>She is?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteJustin.txt
So, she kept trying and got pregnant with me, and carried me to full term and so, since she was, and my dad were both much older, I was a terribly spoiled brat.<n>Because I was their only child and they knew I was going to be their only child and, within reason, I got just about anything I wanted that they could afford, I got.<n>Oh wow!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
But when I was, I think one of my earliest recollections, was when I was three years old, Mama and Daddy and I went down to, to FL.<n>And I remember, going through the lobby of the hotel where we stayed at with my bathing suit on and with one of those God-awful swim caps that everybody that you see when you look in the 40s movies and it felt like I was in a vacuum when I was walking!<n>I could hear my feet in my ears!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
But it still got wet.<n>But that's one of the memories I have of walking across the lobby of the hotel and going clunk, clunk, clunk as I was walking across and then going swimming.<n>And another memory I have is, my mother had a terrible, severe sinus condition.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
And my mother would say to me, "Frances Jeanette!<n>If you get any darker, they're going to make you sit in the back of the bus!"<n>Oh my gosh!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
So, um, we lived on Fort Bragg Rd, which, at that point, was the only road between Fayetteville and Fort Bragg.<n>And with all the added construction and all that, from six in the morning until nine, it was bumper-to-bumper traffic on this little two-lane road going to Fort Bragg.<n>Wow.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
And I remember all the headlights on all the cars were painted black for the first half, the first, the top semi-circle was black so that when if you went out at night, the light would shine just down on the road and not straight ahead.<n>Everybody had window shades, you didn't have blinds back then, but everybody had window shades that were blackout shades and you had to pull them down at night before you turned on any of the lights, because everyone was deathly afraid that the Germans or the Japanese were going to come bomb us.<n>Not that they ever did or--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
\\<n>\\ --I don't think \\ they ever planned on it, but everyone was quite sure that that was going to happen.<n>Looking back it almost seems silly.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
And she'd put me up on the piano bench and would know for at least 30 or 45 minutes exactly where I was because I was sitting there playing the piano.<n>So when I was four, all my little friends were going take, ballet and tap dance lessons and I wanted to, but they encouraged me to play<n>take piano lessons because the piano teacher lived right around the corner and the dance teacher was all the way on the other side of town, where her dance studio was.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
She always kept him in the backyard, so I never went in the backyard.<n>I'd always go in the front door there instead of going around to the back.<n>I hadn't thought about that until just now, for a long time.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
Oh, I bet.<n>And then coming back, we came back through Roanoke, VA and then were on the Skyline Drive, and Daddy said, "We're going to go to Roanoke and there's Roanoke Mountain there."<n>Or Roan Mountain, anyway, there's supposed to be a mountain right in the middle of Roanoke.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
Or Roan Mountain, anyway, there's supposed to be a mountain right in the middle of Roanoke.<n>So I was thinking, having looked at all my books, school books, that it was going to be like the Rockies.<n>--with snow and, you know, crags, a, and rocks and all that sort of thing.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
On the left was a living room with a fireplace.<n>On the right was a dining room and there were stairs going upstairs between that.<n>And behind the dining room was a little, small room that they called a breakfast room, which was just because they had a wall between that and the kitchen.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
And, well, each, each of the bedrooms had the separate stove and refrigerator and they shared a bath.<n>And we would rent them to couples who were just going to be there while their husbands were going through training.<n>And that was interesting!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
It was!<n>It was necessary because the guys were going off to war and the, their wives didn't know when or if they would ever see them again.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
She came down and stayed usually a couple of months, all summer.<n>And she and Leola, Leola brought her over to see Daddy for a condolence call, and sparks flew and they started going out and that's when they decided to get married and she became my stepmom.<n>Wow.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
And I mean it was scandalous!<n>So she had a lot of talk going on about her when she married Daddy and came down to Fayetteville.<n>And, um, cried a lot about it because some people were very spiteful to her.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
So yeah, I learned how to drive at a very early age and needless to say my first car was a straight drive and no one, um, in that town really waited until they were 15 or 16 to drive.<n>We all were driving pretty early because who's going to know about that far out that we didn't have a license so here's related, um, to driving.<n>Another thing, uh, that I learned to, how to do very early on was drive a tractor.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt
I don't want to have anything more to do with the tractor."<n>Well my dad said, "Get back on it your going driving."<n>So he made me get back on it because he wanted to teach me that we make mistakes and that you just have to get back on kind a like if you fall off a horse so that's my stories that I remember about driving.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt
So he made me get back on it because he wanted to teach me that we make mistakes and that you just have to get back on kind a like if you fall off a horse so that's my stories that I remember about driving.<n>OK going back to the whole goat thing, I'll tell you another story about the goats.<n>Uh the fence, um, we had this goat that we bottle fed, actually we bought, our dad bought the goat.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt
So he was quite rambunctious, so he used to always tell us stories about things he did as a kid.<n>First of all, even though he was capable of, uh, going to school and doing his schoolwork, he chose not to and he would always, um, what you call play hooky, and on those days when we wouldn't go to school he would always come up with some kind of tricks, and one of the things I remember him saying that he did and actually since the time this time I had other people confirm that, uh, this is true that he would take a pocketbook, one of his mom's pocketbooks, and empty it out and tie it a string to the handle and he'd put it in the middle of the road and he and his buddy would let the string be long enough to where they could hide in the bushes and still have the string attached and then they'd wait for a car to drive by and there would always be a car to come by because, of course, this was in the country.<n>And a car comes by and sees see a pocketbook they think, you know, we're going to pick this up and do one of two things.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt

yeah<n>and uh i don't think that's going to die very quickly he is getting some support there were a lot of people that are uh that were skeptical and the Cowboys are coming back and they have a pretty good team Troy Aikman looks like to be looks like he's got the star qualities for a quarterback<n>hum yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah if they'll just give him some protection and don't kill him before h e<n>yeah well i was surprised at the the way they drafted last year they didn't really didn't go for the uh big offensive lineman or the defensive lineman they're going for the skilled positions so quarterbacks they really<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt
wins uh in the long run you can have the best half back there is or the best quarterback but if they don't have any blocking maybe they can't do anything<n>yeah they've got an awful lot of good draft picks coming up it's going to be interesting to see what they do with them<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and uh the other teams in the NFC East uh they're they're getting uh older uh they're going to have to like the Washington Redskins uh that that's an older team and they're going to have to start rebuilding pretty soon too<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt

so<n>having your and i know that a lot of these of course are random phone calls they just you know start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2139-ms98-a-trans.txt
i think i dislike the phone number part the worst i mean it's it's one thing to get junk mail because you can you can just put it right in the trash but it's the phone calls and<n>you know usually when they call you it's going to be when you sit right when you sit down to dinner because they know<n>they pretty much know that you're at work all day and they call you right when when you've just gotten home from work the last thing you want is a phone call unless it's you know something halfway enjoyable but if it's a salesperson it's just something you don't want to have to mess with and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2139-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and see what's going on and all those things<n>even if friends call<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2139-ms98-a-trans.txt

kind of keeps you well the first part of it wasn't as<n>scary and intense as i thought it was going to be but toward the end it got got more that way<n>well i understand it has a real complicated plot<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2141-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah yeah it really does<n>the only way they can get any information is through someone who's so crazy and bizarre it's hard to tell what he's going to do next so yeah so it was a good movie<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2141-ms98-a-trans.txt
i agree um the equality of uh the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically<n>demonstrated with this war especially compared with uh the Vietnam war and you see women going off to wars as well as men<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2145-ms98-a-trans.txt
to come in and live with them to come in and live with them<n>or to put their child into a setting into a home setting where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2145-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i agree they<n>so if they're going to have it to me they ought to do it<n>i agree they uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i i'm wondering though<n>they're not going to do it<n>that's my biggest problem is even if you give them the death penalty they appeal it and appeal it and appeal it and there's you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and i do agree that they keep people that we spend too much money keeping people in prison the jails are overcrowded if they're going to do well you know let's do it<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh yeah<n>so she's not going to get to have her baby<n>she no she lost the baby<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i think they should give it to them but i don't think they should keep them waiting in jail and let having us pay for it for twenty years<n>no if they going to give it to them i think they should go ahead you know okay maybe a year or you know like that two years whatever but twenty years ten years on death to me that's worse for them too<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>they're not they don't know when they going to die they know they got the death penalty but that don't mean nothing not anymore<n>well i i assume that you live in do you live in Texas<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt
i<n>but i think they going to have to do something<n>to make people wake up like on especially the drug dealers<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt
my mom would probably kill us but<n>but uh you know it's something that has to be done to me if they bring kids into it because now kids are killing and so they going to have to do something with the death penalty or to scare these people i think that's the whole thing they're not scared they know they're not going anywhere<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt
i'll pull the switch<n>i'll even do you know to me if if that person can forgive them fine but what is that man going to do next is he going to go out and kill somebody else<n>kill  right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt
kill  right<n>you know how many times is it going to take for this man to kill people before you kill him<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>now you know sometimes i can understand maybe if they robbed something they didn't mean to do it okay but how many times you going to go by that how many times you going to this person keep killing so i don't know<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2150-ms98-a-trans.txt

and uh besides it being uh close and being a uh major university in the big ten a prestigious conference i joined the marching band<n>and uh that really was uh a good deal of the motivation for going to that uh college<n>so with the band<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
my uh<n>my husband played music he was involved in music all of his life and went to Notre Dame where he decided he was going to have a good time<n>and never  and then  never went into the scholastic bands he went into uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
so but i know many people who have changed majors several times in uh college uh in fact very few people finish in four years now<n>do you think it do you think it's well worth going to uh uh bigger school or more well-known school<n>uh i really don't think it makes that much difference what size of the school college or university one chooses as long as they have a decent program and they're uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
i think that's what i would tell parents<n>kind of like uh going to SMU they have a reputation as being a party school<n>and uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
and and just lived the easy life<n>well yeah somewhat  i wouldn't mind going back to school again if i thought it i wasn't going to get in trouble again with the with the work it just takes too much time<n>that's true<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's true<n>going back full-time i think is is the way to go<n>oh it it would be wonderful<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>going to all the football games and hockey and basketball games<n>uh because when you're a poor starving student you don't have the uh cash flow to uh entertain yourself  you have to find whatever means you can<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah that was a good thing to look out for<n>i looked into going to Marquette also and had a chance to get a scholarship there but it would have only covered uh about a quarter of the cost of the first uh year which uh wasn't enough of a motivation to uh to go there to commit to to four years<n>well we're still writing checks for the loans for Notre Dame<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
but i think there's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us and like you said save the commentaries<n>because i'm going to listen to the the news and draw my own opinions<n>i don't really need their help to do that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2154-ms98-a-trans.txt

about eighty five was when they started kind of going downhill really but you know i'm just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys Cowboys Cowboys and you know Super Bowl and all this other stuff so<n>i can't you know i'm not going to decide i don't like them just because they're having a few bad years i mean i think they'll pull out of it and you know they'll they'll wind up being good again they've got some lot of really good young players that are going to<n>that are going to uh do pretty good i think<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2157-ms98-a-trans.txt

from one twenty yard line to the other one just on the lower levels is the highest price<n>and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones<n>but um they have about four or five different prices now that they're structuring it with but obviously yeah they're all going up even more or less is what it's going to do<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2157-ms98-a-trans.txt
and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones<n>but um they have about four or five different prices now that they're structuring it with but obviously yeah they're all going up even more or less is what it's going to do<n>so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2157-ms98-a-trans.txt

i know that Bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations but i see that to<n>be a potential power problem later with um who's going to be in charge with this new world order<n>and i you know i'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place but i know we already have a new money system we already have new bills printed for the US Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency and i mean i've seen them<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2235-ms98-a-trans.txt
and so i know that the long-term vision for the US government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh<n>but i'm concerned with whose going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know<n>that's a lot of power for one or two people to have<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2235-ms98-a-trans.txt
because there's no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back and it might not be money it might be um no taxes on our things<n>our computers going into their nation it might come back in another way but it would be come back bu t because we're loaning it i think that's the problem and i don't mean give it to everybody that asks<n>use a lot of discernment don't give money to every nation<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2235-ms98-a-trans.txt
but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them<n>and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money and so i just think we're never going to get that back you know<n>do you understand<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2235-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh he's kind of unhappy i've got it now<n>but i'm not going to give it back<n>yeah that's probably the way it goes sometimes<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2236-ms98-a-trans.txt

um-hum<n>so against going to a nursing home which at that age i can't blame him you know it would just it just scared him to death to be you know that young and who knows you know the thought of being there another twenty or thirty years you know just was was just<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2238-ms98-a-trans.txt
that was another situation because my this was my father lived in Missouri and was in a little small town of about three thousand and uh we just got very very lucky and found a woman<n>who was willing to do this and you know someone that we had known from you know had lived in town you know that same town forever and we knew very well and we knew her history and we knew that she wasn't going to steal from him we knew that she would take good care of him and<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2238-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh<n>and my sister is very blunt and she said mother this is going to be your home you might as well get used to it which i could not say to her<n>and from that point on i think within the next six months she came to accept that as fact and then she began improving and is walking better now than she probably did in three years but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2238-ms98-a-trans.txt
um i think that the attitude<n>is not going to be quite the same<n>well i tend to agree and um uh in that we do live in the United States and i think one of our uh one of the<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2239-ms98-a-trans.txt

i think there would be an awful lot of resentment and um i i really don't think it would be feasible on our country<n>then that raises a question of how you know are you going to pay them or are you going to provide them with you know<n>place to live and food to eat and whether they have a family you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2239-ms98-a-trans.txt
more esoteric<n>yeah what's going on and what needs to be done but i really do think that the population that people are pretty well aware i think more so now than ever before<n>you know i think that's true and i i tend to think that our children are also growing up with a bit more awareness of that at least i mean i i feel i try to as an individual my children are very young but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2239-ms98-a-trans.txt
do you have any uh any thoughts on whether painting's a good idea or a bad idea<n>well well of course uh it depends i guess on what you're uh oh oh what you're you're interest and abilities are so far as whether you're going to paint yourself uh<n>i've painted uh like i said both interior and exterior myself uh not a lot of exterior but uh i've painted you know rooms and ceilings inside and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2240-ms98-a-trans.txt

what do you call the the eaves and stuff and uh<n>yeah so you're lucky too you don't have to worry about going out there and scraping and painting and<n>yeah yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2240-ms98-a-trans.txt
but i i haven't really found it too bad we've lived in our house about uh oh thirteen years i suppose and and really really only painted once and you know it was new when we bought it<n>and we painted one time since then but you know it's probably going to be time to paint again<n>in a couple of years<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2240-ms98-a-trans.txt

in<n>well i think i think my long-term sense of of budget concerns is that we're going is<n>a lot of others government's spending goes on goes towards this uh health care and things like that and a lot of causes of poor health or need for health care are<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2246-ms98-a-trans.txt
somehow we still<n>i guess believed that the countries that we were helping were were eventually going to pay us back<n>and that hasn't happened<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2246-ms98-a-trans.txt
so it's a sort of like this is uh  i see a<n>i don't know there's if there's a metaphor going on who are we loaning the money to and people can disagree about who that money is being loaned to<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2246-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>yeah in some in some cases it uh i think it's actually going to you know the people that it's intended for in other cases<n>uh and and this is all based and this is all up to actually the government that's in control now in some cases the the money actually does filter down to the to where it's<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2246-ms98-a-trans.txt
well um i seem to always be in the the next to the last generation of word processing software when everyone was in Samna i was still in PFM and<n>now that i finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect so i can never quite stay current with that<n>well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it it's uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2247-ms98-a-trans.txt

well that would be a help i wish they would do that here we have got<n>so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade and it's really going to be<n>yes<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2249-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>like that because you know i've talked to many people and we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it<n>uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2249-ms98-a-trans.txt
right well see that's one<n>but i that's not going to be a regular feature that was just a one time thing right after Christmas<n>well the but uh something need does need to be done about the styrofoam<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2249-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>uh because otherwise uh you know they're not going to go house to house collecting it and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2249-ms98-a-trans.txt
they should last a while<n>well let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because<n>i believe we are i i do believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2249-ms98-a-trans.txt
i think they will as long as they can but the problem<n>obviously is the cost of health care as you know it's just going completely out of sight<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt
it is very much so it's a billion dollar problem you know every year<n>uh our company had it doesn't apply to me thank goodness it applies to you know to the younger employees that they're having to pick up you know more of the uh health insurance cost you know themselves the deductibles are going up and the co-payments are going up<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage<n>uh-huh i guess it also depends on how many how many times you're going to use it<n>now we<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt
and if you yeah if you want to so at least you you know you wouldn't have any surprises you can order any type of you know service you want but you stand a good chance you know having to pick up at least part of the bill yourself<n>um-hum so the so i guess that if when i get a job and i and i look into the health insurance that they're going to pay for then i should really look really really deep into the policy<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>but i would really check that out because i'm concerned in coming years it's going to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger folks<n>what i'm really scared about and you know i'm i don't know firsthand but i it seems to me that like you were saying earlier that the deductibles are getting bigger and bigger<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt
that uh they should vote it one way or the other so maybe it is worth having that extra little<n>or going to the the<n>very<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2251-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know we're we're ashamed we're not going to do that anymore and uh<n>yeah exactly<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do on it have  have not been world powers<n>so it's easier for us to say you know to an Iraq you know uh you can't do this get back you know or we're going to force you whereas you know if the Soviet Union would've<n>i don't know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah or or we can do something about it yeah<n>who knows what taking over Mongolia or or something like that who is really will we've been more just rhetoric uh rather than going in there officially uh or you know physically and try to to remove them<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>but i don't believe that he in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either<n>yeah well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward you know just some some pretty hard by the socialism and uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt
a Soviet and if part of you know south let's say South Dakota wanted to succeed you know succeed<n>am i going to stand for that now i realize that the origins are are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt
and that was the whole idea of why they had so many buffers and maybe you know more and more people are seeing or countries hopefully are seeing that<n>that buffer isn't going to help you you can like i guess like with uh Israel is a perfect example the reason they have the Angolan Heights and the<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah there's there's very little that that buys you anymore in today's technology<n>i knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany that said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts all the bombs are going to go right over Germany and they're going to land in other places you know that's going to be the safest place to be  yeah<n>that's probably very true very that's very interesting never thought of that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah um i i suspect the apathy is is due to something like people just feeling that that their vote doesn't count anyway i mean why why bother voting if<n>um if your vote won't make a difference so for instance in um the last presidential election i'm sure a lot of people thought oh Bush is going to win either way why bother voting<n>why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt
why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter<n>that's right i think that's and and the other side of the coin is um people saying well if i really like the underdog candidate i still think they're not going to win so some are saying Dukakis is certainly not going to win why bother voting for him so<n>i think i i think that's a big uh a big a big reason for it how about<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt
i think on the local elections it's actually um i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because<n>they feel like well you know the country's real important and you know if i elect if we help elect a president who's going to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know<n>um and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like that so people think that that that they don't have<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt

tend not to be registered<n>and they don't register and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today they say well i would<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah that that's possible i still think that that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference though as well<n>i think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i'm just a little nobody my vote's not going to count anyway<n>you know and i think that's probably a portion of the population that's massively under represented i i i would guess<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt
and their vote didn't count<n>that's right but but it's the thought they all got out but you wonder if you know if if now the next election they have if only half of them are actually going to show up or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in Russia<n>or any one shows up<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah<n>uh two years ago my children started asking they say picture of it over at Texans and we started going there again we sort of rediscovered it<n>well that that's true i've never thought i've heard about it countless times but never thought about going up there<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2369-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh two years ago my children started asking they say picture of it over at Texans and we started going there again we sort of rediscovered it<n>well that that's true i've never thought i've heard about it countless times but never thought about going up there<n>yeah and uh it got a lot a lot of campsites you know there's uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2369-ms98-a-trans.txt
that<n>really started going about seventeen he's seventeen now he was he was fifteen then but uh i've got a son son and both daughters like to go and uh they have got a a dock down in the protected area<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2369-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah so it's time to quit<n>but you know he can walk back to the little cabin in about five minutes from there but it's it's a ninety nine acre i think it's a ninety nine acre in fact they have acquired some more now that they are going they're going to clear but it's a long term lease from the corps of engineers<n>that's great i'd forgotten all about the Texan side and that's but you got to be a member of Texans to use it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2369-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh<n>well i had only had the boat two years now uh most of the time we either go out to Lavon or uh we have been going up to Arkansas uh she her parents live up on Beaver Lake in northwest Arkansas real good it's uh<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2369-ms98-a-trans.txt
so well you're you're you're you you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose<n>i suppose i do because i've seen a lot of those changes the the changes that women have had in the last generation well you know not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years going from well<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>take it back thirty years  i'm going back too far from my parents' generation when mom stayed home<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh we'll see how the generations go huh<n>but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job<n>yeah i at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did i've i was an engineer with uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
also with uh with work for like three months and and<n>so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer you know the technicians work the eight to five job and and know when they're going to be there<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>but uh if you're going to be more professional professional oriented<n>then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah and so it was in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once<n>um-hum so you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer is that what you think<n>well actually i've found out that i'm not going to go back to being an engineer  i'm i'm i'm a photographer now<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum so you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer is that what you think<n>well actually i've found out that i'm not going to go back to being an engineer  i'm i'm i'm a photographer now<n>oh yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i need it for the break  so<n>yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>yeah i think that's the thing that were going to see well i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next<n>ten years even in the even now they're starting to do it but i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there's going to be a lot of women and they're going to have to work it out to working part time<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i think that's the thing that were going to see well i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next<n>ten years even in the even now they're starting to do it but i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there's going to be a lot of women and they're going to have to work it out to working part time<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah so jobs have to i guess become more flexible<n>i think they're really going to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>it's going to have to be both<n>well so so that's another thing that has to adapt is you know the the the father's attitudes about you know whose whose job is this<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh<n>and i think that's that's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls it's not they're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>needed to be done they're going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be cleaned<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>that's the thing if woman's role like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too and a lot of it's for the better some of the some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things going back to work<n>and i want<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt
um<n>in fact last year i was driving home one night and i was listening to some station some radio station in Iowa and uh the uh DJ was saying uh tonight's going to be like eighty below<n>gosh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2371-ms98-a-trans.txt

and there's three of us EDP auditors and one of the three of us has an accounting background and so she's not real proficient in PCs and the other<n>just hasn't used PCs that much so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing and i'm the administrator for our local area network and i need to keep that going and<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2372-ms98-a-trans.txt
to do work if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night<n>oh the one of the reasons why i got mine was before i went on maternity leave they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because i<n>am pretty much the like you said the guru in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2372-ms98-a-trans.txt
and um<n>so they didn't know how it was going to work they're thinking that we were going to have to get a modem so that we could you know uh and a decks machine so that we could in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2372-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now And it's almost like they're killing each other off<n>and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all<n>would that be so bad<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2373-ms98-a-trans.txt

oh really<n>yeah so he he's uh he's probably going to be going to jail and and the problem with him is he's on a guaranteed salary like for three years so whether he plays or not they've got to pay him ten million dollars so if they<n>uh they can't hardly trade him because nobody wants to pay that much for him and if they just keep him that hurts their salary cap so that guy's got Dallas in a big old bind<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2374-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know he was but he just went for the the big bucks i think<n>Dallas was going to pay him like sixteen million over five years and he got something like eighteen or nineteen million from Las Angeles so he just went where the bucks were<n>and shoot you can't blame him man that's that's a phenomenal amount of money<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2374-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and uh Plano has plans i believe it's tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year the city is going to leave uh receptacles at people's home and they can<n>oh yeah that would be much more convenient yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2376-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out so they had not much participation and they were going to cancel it but then finally people started getting the message<n>yeah it's just a matter of education i think<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2376-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah it's just a matter of education i think<n>yeah and i think that you know if they can get enough going<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2376-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>they'll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city but it's not i think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this and it's not going to be i don't think<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2376-ms98-a-trans.txt
two or two or three weeks on the subject you know and tried to teach you the whole thing in two or three weeks and of course when you're that age you really don't care anyway and i didn't get into it very much but then i took a a list of a basic math class a couple of semesters ago<n>and we uh we were pretty heavily into the metric system and and before we started i just thought oh no i don't want to do this you know this is just going to be so hard and once i really realized how easy it was<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt
and some of them don't realize that they've made a mistake and so uh you know a lot of energy and uh a lot of work and so forth uh goes into building something only to discover it doesn't work<n>right right well you know i think that the that the only way that we are ever going to get this country switched over to metrics is just to start other with with the kids right now<n>Yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt
Yeah<n>you know you you you're going to have to start with the kids who are in school that are in when school and you're going to have to teach it well not like i was in school and do two weeks on it in a math class and that's all you ever hear about it you know they're going to have to start<n>with the little ones and teach it right now and then when you know those little ones are our age you know that's what they're going to know and that's what they're going to use there's no way you're going to get you know most of the United States adult population to automatically relearn and switch<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know you you you're going to have to start with the kids who are in school that are in when school and you're going to have to teach it well not like i was in school and do two weeks on it in a math class and that's all you ever hear about it you know they're going to have to start<n>with the little ones and teach it right now and then when you know those little ones are our age you know that's what they're going to know and that's what they're going to use there's no way you're going to get you know most of the United States adult population to automatically relearn and switch<n>Yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt
Yeah<n>you know it's just not going to happen that way but i do think if they would start with the kids now at you know in you know twenty years from now we could be switched over<n>yeah i kind of agree that uh maybe ten on or twenty years ago we should have gone into a uh sort of a dual display arrangement where you know our our speed limit signs were<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>yeah i think i think it's going to take that but i you know i  i think it's going to take a lot more than that too you know it's going to take it's going to take this education with our with our kids i really believe that but you know you it<n>we we knew that we weren't going to have to ever use it again we knew we were going to have two or three weeks of it in math class so why take the time to really learn it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i think i think it's going to take that but i you know i  i think it's going to take a lot more than that too you know it's going to take it's going to take this education with our with our kids i really believe that but you know you it<n>we we knew that we weren't going to have to ever use it again we knew we were going to have two or three weeks of it in math class so why take the time to really learn it<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>you know i mean you would you know learn enough to get by on the test and then you forgot about it because you knew you were never going to see it again in the rest of your years of school<n>you know and and that that's not the way to convert over you're going to have these kids you know teaching it dually even you know teaching both systems which is a lot i know a lot more for the teachers to have to teach but that's the only way they're going to get switched over you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know i mean you would you know learn enough to get by on the test and then you forgot about it because you knew you were never going to see it again in the rest of your years of school<n>you know and and that that's not the way to convert over you're going to have these kids you know teaching it dually even you know teaching both systems which is a lot i know a lot more for the teachers to have to teach but that's the only way they're going to get switched over you know<n>yeah i think also equally important is that uh it needs to be put into practice in in everyday life we're seeing a little bit of it now that you go out to work on your car and you discover your English wrenches don't fit<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt
buy a whole knew metric set yeah<n>well i think you know it's something that's going to take quite some time to happen<n>but i i still don't think that they're doing all that it's going to take to make it happen you know it's going to happen slowly no matter what but there's going to have to be a lot more education involved than there is right now to get it to to get it to switch over<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i think you know it's something that's going to take quite some time to happen<n>but i i still don't think that they're doing all that it's going to take to make it happen you know it's going to happen slowly no matter what but there's going to have to be a lot more education involved than there is right now to get it to to get it to switch over<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>so well i think eventually it will happen you know it's just going to take it's just going to take a lot of education and a lot of time and like i said i was just totally amazed at how at how very easy it was you know i i just couldn't<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt

right right<n>well you know i think uh i think it's going to happen i don't know i don't know what else i could suggest to them you know if they ask me what should we do<n>i don't know i wouldn't know what else to suggest to them just education start with these little kids you know and like you said you know start making it practice you know start showing all the street signs and all the cars of course i think all the cars are manufactured that way they aren't aren't all of them<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2377-ms98-a-trans.txt

well i haven't had too much of a chance to watch TV lately so probably everything i'm going to say is kind of dated<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2436-ms98-a-trans.txt
in the since i got out of college which was about five years ago i've my TV viewing started to tend more towards uh<n>documentary news programs things like that something that's going to keep me up to date i've kind of kind of gotten away from uh being a series watcher having to keep up to date with uh<n>um-hum um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2436-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>that's that's uh that's going to be good and interesting for the kids even even cartoons um you you know you  you watch uh you watch some of the cartoons and<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2436-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>kids kids aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there it none of it's probably damaging lot of times but uh<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2436-ms98-a-trans.txt
well<n>oh do you get the comedy you don't have cable now i was going to say they have a comedy channel now but again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly uh commercials and then you're<n>no we don't yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2436-ms98-a-trans.txt
those people that have that and and however they got into it i have children i always worry about the the classical thing that you see on TV where the drug uh pushers<n>give it to the kids for free you know and get them sucked in and then they sell it to them you know the classical thing is to give it away or i always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party and they slip it to them i i don't know i don't even have that much knowledge to know<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2437-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>you're not too sure what's going on he tells parents all the time haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked<n>the the key thing that i think uh we try to do is that bring all the friends over here have our house as a place where they can come at any time<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2437-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh yeah i think that's a really good thing to encourage<n>and then you can kind of keep an eye and you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want but at least you see what's going on and uh you always have your house welcome then then your children'll think that uh you know you're cool parents and all that you know<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2437-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and we have one of course i say in college driving and and one going to drive this summer so uh kids are cost you practically nothing because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything but<n>you wait until they go and get a car insurance and you and that's when they get expensive as they get older you know uh it it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2437-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh no i i don't work for TI so i get cash<n>oh okay well i i didn't know what they're they were going to do they sent us a little booklet i just got it a week or so ago saying you know<n>so many calls will be something a prize and everything<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2437-ms98-a-trans.txt
right yeah there's yeah<n>well that's great well what kind of cash i've forgotten what were they going to do<n>hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2437-ms98-a-trans.txt
um i've always been a physique that can stay skinny no matter what i eat or how much i eat or if i<n>uh exercise or not and they tell me that's going to catch up with me someday uh<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2438-ms98-a-trans.txt
he um it it of course it was much more prevalent in Europe exercise was much more taken much more seriously than it was here in fact<n>it it hasn't it's just now getting to the level where it was in Europe you know now with everybody is going to the health clubs and everything<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2438-ms98-a-trans.txt
but i'm at the point right now where i have some concern my mother has history of heart problems for herself and her family my father had phlebitis<n>and um i'm i'm realizing that i need to do something uh or you know i'm going to suffer for it if i don't especially where i'm i'm about thirty pounds overweight<n>and so i've started an exercise program i'm i'm sometimes i'm a lot more<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2438-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and uh boy after a few years of sitting down and then going to that camp as a camper this time i couldn't even do what i used to do<n>and it was really an eye opener for me to see that even sitting down for a little while sure changes the old body's capacity<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2438-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's right that's right<n>well you can reduce that risk by uh having the car checked out i mean you know you you if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this but if you've narrowed it down to one or two<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2439-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>yeah i just about could really because i think my car if i continue taking good care of it it's going to hold a pretty good resale value and uh that if i consider going the used car route and save up some money i shouldn't have too much trouble at all<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2439-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh no<n>so uh but but uh it runs fine all you have it's just very thirsty if i just keep the oil in it seems to be okay but you know that's a sign that i'm going to have to do something sooner or later<n>um-hum yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2439-ms98-a-trans.txt
it's a a Buick Century<n>um-hum are you going to trade it in on this new one or<n>uh no my fiance is selling uh a nineteen seventy eight Cutlass Supreme that she has it's actually in better condition than my car<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2439-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and so she's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2439-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>so she's going to sell it rather than trade it in that's probably the best thing<n>yeah um you you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2439-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh there you go<n>you can do much better i'm glad you're you're taking care of it yourself i i think trading it in they just use that as additional they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you're buying but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in<n>well that's fact<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2439-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>prices plus i was going through that TI fleet discount program<n>the okay did you did you use it  the car shop place<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2439-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the and the cruise control he said you're going to get a car that's got flood damage or hail damage and they just laughed at me<n>yeah yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2439-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>that they required you to do and i took it to Town North and sure enough i saw that guy and he recognized me he said he said oh hi Dana and he kind of looked down and saw that car and i'm and i'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day of course when when the place in Arlington<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2439-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>for the adjustments at fifteen thousand and thirty thousand and i change the oil every two to three thousand miles and i take real because i figured it was going to have to last me a while you know so i decided no matter what if i had to let a bill go i would take care of my car<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2440-ms98-a-trans.txt
um<n>so huge like what you all have over there you know and they we look right out my office looks right out onto the parking lot and i didn't see anything going on and i'm always looking out the window<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2440-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and then i would just go on Saturdays but  since the first of the year neither one of us have been going<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2442-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>so  you know like you said we've been paying these fees and not going so it's kind of a a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it<n>yeah i i think you really have to be disciplined<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2442-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and we i have two friends that we walk they have babies that are about the same age as as mine and we've been walking every morning at going when it was cold we'd go to the mall it's because you can't take the babies out very easily<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2442-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-huh<n>think that's going to happen in the next twenty years but uh you know i think that there's progress<n>and i'm not very political so i don't really know you know any i don't know any statistics on you know how many women run for public office and how often they're defeated<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2453-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>i don't know any statistics either but it's it's probably going to be the same type of situation that that uh the black people have gone through it took them<n>well black men long time to to get up to the pay scales of the white man and now i think it it's feasible for a black man to be president<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2453-ms98-a-trans.txt

but uh eventually you know the the tax money is getting extremely low on the FSLIC<n>i mean they're in they're getting they're getting so low it it's almost in trouble and and where's where's that going to come from<n>and the<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2454-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah that's true that's true<n>that's what scares me when you get into that type of situation you know if you are going to change it watch out for the person that's changing it they may put another loophole in that<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2454-ms98-a-trans.txt
wasn't even there to begin with<n>yeah and and and people like us never hear about about what's really going on and what they what they're really doing<n>and i think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of time because they're there to sell newspapers that's the problem with the news both the on television and the paper<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2454-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah but i'm it's one of those one of those things that i just don't know where the answer lies<n>it's just it's just it's going to uh it it doesn't seem like it's going as badly as it did in the past few years it's kind of slow because the closings has kind of slowed a little bit<n>well now there was an article in the paper this morning in the business section how tough it was to get a loan approved anymore<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2454-ms98-a-trans.txt

right<n>job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or you know all sorts of other things<n>yeah it it seems too me like though women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore the women are spreading themselves thinner<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2455-ms98-a-trans.txt

what they were you know what they were looking for in other words if if in Spring crain training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do<n>um then it really doesn't give you any indication but if they were uh playing the people that they're going to play then that might be pretty good indication so you know it's it's it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just<n>you know come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring craning training and then gone on a you know fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season so<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2460-ms98-a-trans.txt
that have the talent to do the best years and um that they hadn't had these<n>uh gigantic uh career years yet and and just kind of assume that you know someone one of them is going to break through eventually so and i i think they said the Reds um this last year i'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2460-ms98-a-trans.txt

oh absolutely<n>like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours uh because i was going out<n>she would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2503-ms98-a-trans.txt

do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote<n>i think it's somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference<n>and they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked you know and so they figure why go out and vote you know they're going to do what they want to do they're corrupt anyway<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt

and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something i mean that's the only thing that i can figure out because<n>i've heard so many people say well i'm not going on voting on that one you know i i'm going to go fishing today or it won't make any difference if if i don't vote  and i think it does we vote every time<n>well it uh there's no question it does make a difference uh so far as having a party and then all voting uh when you have different precincts you would have to have a party in every precinct<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt
absolutely<n>and and they are doing that in a number of schools however probably not enough of them uh country wide but it's going to take at least a whole generation of people uh to<n>get across the idea of voting uh just like it's taking a whole generation of people to finally uh realize the harmfulness of drugs<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum sure right<n>and that's the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party okay we're going to have a block party everybody's going to get together we're going to discuss the different issues and stuff and then we're going to go and vote you know we're going to go vote like<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt

you know really on fire for God and they're just surpassing America Latin America by<n>the drugs you know it's just incomprehensible and uh so i just think that i think that God's going to honor that and that he's going to put in some good leadership and i know the president of i believe Costa Rica<n>is a Christian and he goes to no Guatemala because he goes to Virgo Church in Guatemala City our church is in real close relationship with him<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2514-ms98-a-trans.txt
so they're the people are trying to override that i mean not just the Christians but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority the people rejoice so yeah<n>yeah good see that's the thing that is going to have to that's the undoing of everything is that we have no morals i mean<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2514-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>talk about the crime and all that in the city it's just the kids have no morals that's the thing that will eventually you know if anyone is going to be saved it is having a good moral background<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2514-ms98-a-trans.txt
and stayed i've been there twice and stayed and that was that was just really sad but a lot of it though is their debt i think that we should not loan them anymore money that if we still want to give them money give them money<n>quit loaning it to them you're not going to get it back don't be indebted to anybody don't be the you know loaner nor borrower and it's just not good we need to if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them but quit loaning all the money out which i don't think we're loaning anymore now but<n>that's how we got into a problem if we got them we have sink them in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars that common sense you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2514-ms98-a-trans.txt
quit loaning it to them you're not going to get it back don't be indebted to anybody don't be the you know loaner nor borrower and it's just not good we need to if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them but quit loaning all the money out which i don't think we're loaning anymore now but<n>that's how we got into a problem if we got them we have sink them in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars that common sense you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back<n>yeah also uh uh Mexico that we will loan the money in uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2514-ms98-a-trans.txt
that was really stupid on our part to even loan it to them you don't loan money to people like that i mean if you feel like you need to give them something to help them out fine but you don't go making<n>billions of dollars of loans in to people that you can just look at the situation and yeah and know that they are not going to be capable of paying us back and<n>they know they're not going to pay it back<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2514-ms98-a-trans.txt
billions of dollars of loans in to people that you can just look at the situation and yeah and know that they are not going to be capable of paying us back and<n>they know they're not going to pay it back<n>that puts a bondage on them it makes you know pressure on the nation and on the people on the leadership and makes their inflation go up and it's just a big mess so<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2514-ms98-a-trans.txt

really wow that's amazing because i would have thought that it would be better to wait a little bit<n>nah so it's sort of an old wife or common folk tales about you know if you're going to have a cat spayed let it go through heat first not true because when they go into heat their uh<n>genetic parts swell up and expand and everything and then once you do take them into surgery it's a little more difficult easier to have them spayed before they even go into heat<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2517-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-huh<n>but they showed reruns of Dallas and it was great because i could turn it on and all of the people were very familiar to me and i'd seen all of the shows so i knew what was going on<n>so you didn't need to know the language<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2550-ms98-a-trans.txt

i think what she did to him was a travesty<n>yeah but he's going to be  he's going to be running the firm for the next i don't know ten days or whatever to evaluate<n>that's funny<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2550-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>they're going to stay there in fact um<n>Susan Dey and and uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2550-ms98-a-trans.txt
and they said well we wanted we wanted you but we didn't really want Stuart<n>because he's not a litigationist and we didn't figure you you would come without him and and we're going to be fighting against each other so<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2550-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh she did<n>yeah and that was real tough for him and there were some times on the show where there were some real emotional things going on with the<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2550-ms98-a-trans.txt
we uh our town is just five thousand people and i've been very discouraged by the local authorities dragging their heals about getting into a recycling program each<n>politician who comes up from election promises that that's going to be real high on his list of priorities but it just doesn't seem to be working out that way<n>uh one of our local city council members who happens to be a personal friend of ours made the statement the other day that there would always be landfills and we just sort of came unglued at that point because if that's their thinking<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2551-ms98-a-trans.txt
sure<n>you know it's it's a matter of i i don't think you know i hate to get government involved with anything because it always costs more money but um you know it's a matter of they're going to have to pass stricter laws or start making<n>i know i know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2551-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>as far as well that's one way to force them to recycle is that if they bill them by the pound then they're going to save it and not not put it out to the trash<n>that's right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2551-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh it we are in an open rural community and we find more garbage on the roadsides when it starts costing people they simply take a bag and pitch<n>pitch it into a ditch someplace uh my  my biggest concern or one of my biggest concerns is is the tires what they're going to ever do with used tires my husband uh recently retired after thirty two years in a service station and of course<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2551-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>well i you've certainly hit on the key to any of it whatever we're going to do there has to be a profit there doesn't there the fellow who recycles the paper and the plastic and the aluminum he's got to be able to make a profit or he just isn't going to do it<n>there's not a profit<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2551-ms98-a-trans.txt
it's costing us a lot more than money isn't it<n>yeah it it's going to leak into our water and then we're going to have problems with our water and then it's going to cause health problems and so there is a long-term<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2551-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum um-hum<n>well we have to come to that now that's all there is to it you do see a lot of positive things uh i saw a printout sheet the other day that i'm going to to copy and take to the girls at sorority<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2551-ms98-a-trans.txt
well Brent i've been um<n>i kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because i thought uh if it it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2552-ms98-a-trans.txt
yes<n>going on there and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything you know all out in this in the in this schoolyard there so we just said hey let's stop and<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2552-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>yeah you it's it's hard sometimes at work because you know people say oh we're taking a cruise we're going here we're going there you know because they have a lot more money<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2552-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>then of course then of course there was the fraud but you're going to have that anywhere so<n>yeah i think<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2553-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>you would think i was asking for an appointment with the president you know and basically what it came down to is they weren't going to let me have it<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2553-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh<n>and that's just ludicrous i mean i mean the way things are going people are more and more working out of their homes i know a lot of people who do lawyers doctors uh architects consultants<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2553-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>so i mean  you know what's the story on them you know are you going to let them have it well of course they're going to get it you know all you've got to do is have a nice big bank account balance and they'll give it to you<n>yeah i uh i also run a little business out of my home on the side what's the nature of yours<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2553-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>yeah what the heck i'm surely not going to count this as business income<n>yeah um really well speaking of that i think we've probably given them their money's worth<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2553-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>but anyway if you need to get going we'll we'll terminate<n>okay<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2553-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh i mean it's you know it<n>i don't think it's going to change very much but<n>no i agree with that as as far as the as far as the mess that's developing as a result um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2554-ms98-a-trans.txt
i just i heard a comment on the radio this morning that uh you know it it gets to a point where uh<n>if enough people are are going to be slaughtered over there over the<n>the the internal problems um somebody may step in again but uh i really think it's it's a UN issue<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2554-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in in Iraq they're going crazy you know i mean you can't please them one way or the other<n>that's right that's right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2554-ms98-a-trans.txt
um<n>i mean these these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time some of them have been going on for for tens of years if if i understand it right in places like the Sudan and<n>all the time i mean yeah i mean<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2554-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>yeah and it's certainly and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years and it's going to continue as long as you have so many diverse groups that are that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2554-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah and until we until we start changing our educational system i mean<n>we're we're going to be we're we've already been overtaken but it's going to get even worse later i mean looks who's looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the the math and the science and everything it's not us<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2554-ms98-a-trans.txt
and and where are the engineers coming from<n>uh well they're they're coming from various places and a lot of them are going back there<n>yeah exactly<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2554-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>he has no intention of going back to the Philippines because there's no jobs<n>sure okay<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2554-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and they're coming here going after the hard degrees and then they're going back to Korea and Japan and Hong Kong and everywhere else and they're applying it there<n>absolutely<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2554-ms98-a-trans.txt
and<n>i don't know it's to me it's amazing i don't know what we're going to do as a country we're we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later<n>yeah because you know every every the the country's got a problem with uh with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that and the long long range views are are just kind of become a thing of the past<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2554-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>well at a price tag of six thousand bucks i don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers<n>no absolutely<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2554-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's absolutely right yeah<n>now you watch just sure as anything the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2554-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>the other thing too is that the oak trees have those acorns and i don't know if i'm uh going to have to go out there and if i can rake those up or if i'm going to have to pick them all up by hand or what<n>i don't think there's it's it's an impossible task<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2556-ms98-a-trans.txt
i have uh bushes and stuff that really need trimming and um so uh<n>so i'm just thinking how in the world i was going to have to scrape up all those uh acorns that are sitting out there they even have some little trees growing<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2556-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>because they just left them the acorns i guess sit rather than raking them up um so you know i'm going to have to get out there and<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2556-ms98-a-trans.txt
well you better price the new shrubs before you do that<n>i'm just going to get the little baby shrubs  the little baby ones you know take several years to grow  there um<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2556-ms98-a-trans.txt
sure<n>okay i think by this fall it's going to be required that the town of Clarion which we live nearby will have mandatory recycling started<n>so<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2557-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh well<n>we're we're going to pay for that that whether we pay industry or pay we we've already paid industry for like these super fund that's cleaning up we paid industry for it<n>yeah that's true<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2557-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i think that in the in the cases that like that uh they had to be<n>uh pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war it was<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2558-ms98-a-trans.txt
well that makes sense and then you run into again to um<n>the bureaucracy in running it you know how you going to cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then<n>oh yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2558-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh<n>yeah yeah i'm sorry i'm going to have to go but my other line is blinking but it was good to talk to you<n>but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2558-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah right<n>you watch the reruns boy i mean you could watch those for a long time if you haven't if you don't even know what's going on at all<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2560-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>yeah It was in the it was in the summer at at at at the time but you think they would pay more attention to what was going on that they'd see this guy had taken off his clothes<n>that's crazy but i think they're under stress i mean i can't imagine working in a nursing home like that either because it must be so depressing<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2561-ms98-a-trans.txt
well actually my father's parents both of them<n>sort of you know they just died of something um but the my grandmother my grandmother's case which is very sad she fell she came into New York to visit and she fell at the airport going down some steps and spent you know six months in the hospital but it is was still it it was it wasn't<n>yeah so yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2561-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-huh<n>but i just couldn't see it you know going off and leaving everything like that<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2562-ms98-a-trans.txt
but that's because i'm allergic to the grass<n>oh that'd be awful i love going out in the Summer in the grass<n>really now i like to go to the beach where the sand is because then it doesn't make me ill<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2562-ms98-a-trans.txt

crime in the cities and i guess in some of the rural areas too seems to be going up i don't know it'll ever go down on any steady basis uh more people more opportunities and<n>somewhat of a lessened uh sensitivity toward it it's almost um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2563-ms98-a-trans.txt
somewhat of a lessened uh sensitivity toward it it's almost um<n>you know it's almost expected that that's going to occur and there's not quite the shock any more especially the so-called littler<n>things where people tend to steal a little time at work or steal a few supplies or<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2563-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i'd agree with that<n>uh i guess that's not going to do anything but spread as as uh economic hardships spread and so will the the crimes of that age group i guess<n>i've got a a brother-in-law that's on the police force and and his uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2563-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh uh<n>it's random in the fact that you don't know when you're going to be called but everybody will be called<n>and how often are they doing it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2564-ms98-a-trans.txt
it may be up to the the work place to help try to control it because it doesn't seem like any where else uh you know we're getting that assistance<n>because in schools you know i i would hate to have a child young child right now because i think this is going to be a tough tough period for young kids with uh you know the drugs as rampant as they are<n>uh-huh well i've got an eleven year old son and an eight year old daughter and my son says i don't understand this drug stuff why don't people understand all you have to do is say no<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2564-ms98-a-trans.txt

right<n>what one would be an example like should i say postal service or not i mean are they going to screw up on mail<n>like what about your<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2564-ms98-a-trans.txt
well see i don't really see the need of it you know<n>how many elementary school teachers do you think are going to be on drugs<n>right uh i guess the only the only concern i'd have<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2564-ms98-a-trans.txt
somewhere else right<n>especially since we're going to cut<n>you know i guess the only fear i would have would be that uh you know if i had a child uh that one in a million first grade teachers that would be on drugs my child would be in their class you know and and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2564-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's interesting<n>yeah i i also lived uh eight years in Ohio before going to uh going away to college<n>and i used to go watch the Toledo Mud Hens<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2565-ms98-a-trans.txt

i tend to agree on that very strongly<n>sexual crimes unless there's a true change of character and that's where we just have to to trust the authorities and they're not going to excuse people if it was was run like that i don't there would probably be very few exceptions to<n>that and if it was done quickly and done swiftly and but it's not because the judicial system has rejected they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2571-ms98-a-trans.txt
but i know that they have like uh their crime rate it's not Jamaica i don't think i can't remember which it's uh one of the Caribbean Islands and and they<n>Singapore is it like that my husband's going Singapore and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law and the law is enforced and that's what what when you have lawlessness<n>i mean the law's not being enforced and all that does is lawlessness we were we went on a mission trip to Manhattan<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2571-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-huh<n>and that it's probably not going to end anytime soon the pressure you know to work and just the pressure it puts on the American family<n>and um i  i thought about that and i said yeah that's funny you hardly have time to go vote for this Congressman because you know women are expected to do so much now and i just kind of laughed and i thought God i never thought of it like that you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i think that's that's a good observation and and true yes uh<n>yeah but i agree too with what everything you said but i think the two go and then you put those two things together and you're going to have you know no one going to vote but then um i don't know disillusion what's the solution<n>yeah oh what's the solution huh start over again  you know that's we've the people have talked you know about having about redoing the Constitution completely or changing the government a little you know to some extent<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
we don't have we don't have a little child but i know that when you go in a restaurant we had some foster twins and<n>it was last year and it wasn't through the state but boy howdy man these kids needed a whipping sometimes not to be beaten not to be abused but to firmly be told you are not going to do that and you are not going to spit in my face i said no<n>yeah he<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and if you do that this is going to be the consequence but it you couldn't do that even through the state even the mother it wasn't through the state but even though um the mother really would given approval but because of the situation we just didn't think it was<n>wisdom you know you go in a restaurant and they start spitting their food out at the table now come on but you know you couldn't do really a lot because of the state's control so that's that's a good idea there too i like that but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>anyway you know have you ever had a two year olds twins start spitting their food at you at Luby's you know i mean you're like going i mean yes<n>uh yeah i i remember our our our daughter's twenty five<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt

um i don't<n>i i don't think that that we can ever be convinced as a country that that they're going to change or you know not be a threat<n>well only unless they change their form of government<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2574-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>well it's going to be interesting in the next few years to see what happens because there's quite a strong democratic um um<n>group over there<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2574-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's true<n>but you know i i i think that i think or at least i hope that they understood that's what was going to happen now you can't go from a a communist economy to a democratic one and expect things to be great overnight<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2574-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i know we we've shoveled so much aid to Poland and<n>i don't know of course you don't hear hear the bad things out of there like you used to but it doesn't mean they're not going on it just means the press decided to cover something else<n>that's true<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2574-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>well it's like it's like Saddam you know we're going to build them up and then have to go in there and take care of them<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2574-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah we're not too far  behind i graduated in seventy one so i'm i'm same generation<n>i i'm it's going to be a short conversation because i agree with you i i think uh  i don't i don't even think it ought to be uh voluntary i think it ought to be mandatory<n>uh for kids to either either do military service or public service one of the two uh a lot of reasons for that not not just because i'm a i'm a hard ass or anything it's just that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2575-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>like you say kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do<n>and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2575-ms98-a-trans.txt
all through high school was boy i can't wait to get out of high school i can't wait to get out of high school and i wanted to go to college and i had the grades to go to college and i got accepted to college but when i got out of high school i kind of said<n>you know what am i going to do now you know it's like<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2575-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh yeah sure<n>sure i mean i mean the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money you know that i i remember when i was a kid i used to do little little things for the old folks around the neighborhood and uh i know how it made me feel<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2575-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah well that's that's the that's the point we've gotten to you know every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government<n>and you the government's going to be limited i where are they going to get the money they're going to get it from us and we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government we don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2575-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>i don't and i don't understand the reasoning for it i really don't it it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money<n>then they should return something to the public i mean if nothing else go out along an interstate and pick up garbage<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2575-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh<n>in fact uh there was one lady in this area she was caught going to work and leaving her daughter in her car all day<n>oh my gosh just a baby<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2576-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i i think what's happened too is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up<n>aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2576-ms98-a-trans.txt
but i can't say that there's really that many people that like sit in front of the TV all day<n>well that's a change then oh of course going to school too<n>it's different from the home environment<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2576-ms98-a-trans.txt

um i'm quite concerned that if you let everyone who hasn't yet used a gun in a felony uh haven't hasn't yet committed a felony<n>if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature you're going to start getting a lot of gunfire<n>it's it's hard for me to imagine that a a situation of you know take it to it's logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2634-ms98-a-trans.txt
if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature you're going to start getting a lot of gunfire<n>it's it's hard for me to imagine that a a situation of you know take it to it's logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire<n>i actually it's not it's more of a police action in itself the fact that everybody's packing a piece is a deterrent is a deterrence to someone saying well i'm going to mug this guy right here but hey he<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2634-ms98-a-trans.txt
it's it's hard for me to imagine that a a situation of you know take it to it's logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire<n>i actually it's not it's more of a police action in itself the fact that everybody's packing a piece is a deterrent is a deterrence to someone saying well i'm going to mug this guy right here but hey he<n>carrying just as much firepower as i can and if there's if you got to go through a certification course to get to where to where you can carry it in public<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2634-ms98-a-trans.txt

well as as someone who would would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander i feel more comfortable with people having blades because uh<n>you're not going to get  bullets flying around and killing people instantly and uh<n>well if i'm the one doing the shooting i don't miss that's the kind of training i've had i mean it's<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2634-ms98-a-trans.txt

that's true if if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket and sometimes you may think well i don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something<n>yeah yeah and it gives you a sense um a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say oh well i don't have to pay for it now but you're going to have to pay for it and it seems like<n>yeah you think well i don't have it now but payday will come and then i'll have the money but that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time  yes<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>that's going to take up what you would have made<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh you get that stuff in the mail all the time<n>yes yes and then i'll i'll have just like uh department stores they'll call me up you know and i'll say look i don't want the credit card well we're just going to send it to you you know you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to they'll send me any credit card i tear it up<n>what i really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that i do have still that they send you these things that look like checks<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt
but it this is her first credit card thing well when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal look at this they sent me this money you know<n>so then when i explained to her look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest and stuff of course she ter tore it up but a lot of parents would not take the time<n>you know and they wouldn't even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and i are<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt
i have seen so many people and i have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen<n>she got uh i can't remember what she called it it's some kind of maybe it's sure or something like that it's something it's some weird name of a credit card and she is charging out of her mind already and i'm going you just got off<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt
i mean i cannot hardly tolerate to owe something like you know i guess it's just because i've been brought up like that<n>but um i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to pay out<n>but that's just the way i feel about it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know you just have to have these things just you know have them at home have to have them at my own place and that's you know a big expenditure to start um<n>buying all these things that you think or or have to have and actually they're kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place you know going in one big swoop save up and then buy it<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt
well we're geared to that we're like okay like i want a living room set and instead of sitting back and and<n>going okay well it's going to cost maybe a thousand dollars two thousand dollars and i'll save for two years people go oh well i'll just go buy it put it on credit and i'll pay it off<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt
the<n>oh yes it certainly does and familiarity with the area there's sometimes advantages to moving way off and going to a unknown area but uh there's as many<n>right well for example yeah yeah i i think that's very true because for example uh i'm going to graduate school after i finish here and uh i'm going to go to California<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2644-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh yes it certainly does and familiarity with the area there's sometimes advantages to moving way off and going to a unknown area but uh there's as many<n>right well for example yeah yeah i i think that's very true because for example uh i'm going to graduate school after i finish here and uh i'm going to go to California<n>to stay in the same area<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2644-ms98-a-trans.txt
i think also you know um dialogue between university professors helps a lot in decisions because i think that's what really turned me<n>towards that you know the the school that i'm going to is i went and talked to the people in the school and they gave me information which i could not have gotten otherwise and that that really finalized my decision<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2644-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum um-hum<n>so i'm kind of branching off into a pretty specific region which i think is going to be a hot topic in the future with you know all these lands and and things that are being spoiled<n>no question<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2644-ms98-a-trans.txt
so are you happy with what you're doing now<n>yeah i am kind of happy with it it it's getting better all the time i knew it would be different from the very beginning but you know as as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system so i was in the computer operations<n>it's uh you know it all starts to become similar there's you know there's benefits and there's things that weren't as good but as an overall package i'd say i i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2645-ms98-a-trans.txt
so<n>despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or or going for walks in the mountains i can't seem to get into it right now<n>exactly<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2645-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah funny how that happens after kids right<n>that uh those type of qualities have uh moved into the picture and then there's there's some economic concern but usually it's if if it's going to be a night out it's going to be a a decent meal and<n>and uh fortunately for us there's not a whole lot of places in the immediate area that's totally really expensive you have to go a ways to get to a really<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah they do oddly enough even being near near the gulf uh they tend to advertise the the main<n>the whole east coast uh seafood for some reason it tends to be a draw i don't know particularly why i mean to me it tastes pretty much the same once you do to it whatever you're going to do to it you know like<n>oh is that right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
and um but not as often we don't do it as often<n>um and what i'm finding now is they're finally getting to the age where we're venturing into going again with them<n>and of course when you take them though you're going to go to something like a McDonald's level or maybe a little bit of a family style restaurant<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
um and what i'm finding now is they're finally getting to the age where we're venturing into going again with them<n>and of course when you take them though you're going to go to something like a McDonald's level or maybe a little bit of a family style restaurant<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
i i i tend to agree with you too we look for more um<n>uh quiet type more of a subdued atmosphere now and i think part of that is after you have kids you're you're not as interested in going to uh Georgetown type places where you know you go in every place and there's a lot of uh noise<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
and um not all of them do take reservations either so so you sometimes have to allot yourself uh enough time<n>um you know to go out uh you can't figure on going out and being back in two hours you know<n>um the other thing that's changing here is because of the um the age set here uh a lot mostly people in they're i'd say late twenties to early forties in these neighborhoods that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
um to children and making half price menus for them whereas before um they would be totally discouraged from bringing children in<n>and they're doing this basically because they're so many working parents in this area and that they were losing the business because once all these younger people were having children they weren't going to the restaurants<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt

right<n>being as worldly as i could possibly be  getting into as many organizations as i could possibly could and and one other point i was going to make was that i can understand i can see that probably if i had gone to a smaller school i would probably have<n>more friends<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>i was going to ask who won<n>you know what she what she wants anyway but that was the big deal and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know what she what she wants anyway but that was the big deal and<n>in in that case uh regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed and finding a school that that met her specific requirements and and made the best fit for her<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt
and that that's another point is that the a parent should tell their child to be<n>or or to give their child the leeway to choose their school not so much choose the school for them but you know kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're going to do<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt

right<n>and so whoever's in there is going to take care of you as opposed to going into a chain restaurant where they're just hiring you know people out of that really don't probably don't care too much about the establishment so they're not going to worry about taking care of you<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2659-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and i guess it depends you know if if it's just you and your husband going out to eat uh unless it's uh anniversary or something like that atmosphere doesn't mean that much but if you're taking another couple or taking<n>relatives or friends or something you want the place you know to be nice<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2659-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh so it uh and now with uh all the lawyers you know rising in arms and going off to join uh Michael i guess whoever uh<n>um-hum it looks like it's gonna the last few episodes are going to be good<n>yeah yeah matter of fact uh i guess that's going to be the same same same uh what Dallas and uh LA Law and a lot of these are really uh i guess are really going for a lot of cliffhangers this year<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2666-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum it looks like it's gonna the last few episodes are going to be good<n>yeah yeah matter of fact uh i guess that's going to be the same same same uh what Dallas and uh LA Law and a lot of these are really uh i guess are really going for a lot of cliffhangers this year<n>right and well and LA Law is getting rid of several of their characters<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2666-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah because i<n>it it's pretty obvious though like Corbin Benson is probably not going to be there long because he's been starring in these uh miniseries and and his part's gotten smaller and smaller and they're bringing on the uh like the British uh lawyer who uh<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2666-ms98-a-trans.txt
it sure is it sure is it sure is how about you do you exercise on a regular basis<n>um well i try to um i started at the beginning of this year i decided all right i'm going to start exercising again i'm going to be real good and i went through the TI fitness center and registered for the uh aerobics classes there<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh<n>and it cost sixty dollars and i thought okay that's not cheap that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money and i had a friend of mine going so i was real good i only missed it about three times<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt
right yeah walking is kind of boring i do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood and we try to<n>we used to try to get together and i think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking there's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex<n>uh-huh uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>it's just hard to make yourself go and i i think one thing i don't like about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night and i've been sweaty and and it you know i don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands so it kind of kills the<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt
does it cost the same for just two nights or<n>no it's less expensive this one was only forty five dollars but i'm glad it's not too totally cheap because if it was too c heap i would talk myself out of going more probably<n>well that's good too<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah yeah it's right there and it's they have a really nice facility at the TI they've got two different aerobics rooms they have the mirrors of course<n>sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall you don't like to see how you work but i guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going but<n>no<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt
except i'm fixing not to be a TIer after a week from today<n>you going to Motorola<n>no i'm going to Onum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt
you going to Motorola<n>no i'm going to Onum<n>oh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt
right right<n>and would then and and that's significant and every once in a while they make noises like they're going to take that out and that would just kill the housing industry if they did<n>oh yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt
and and so i i got this three thousand foot five bedroom house that i've got almost paid off<n>and have all kinds of equity in it and don't have  and you know struggling to keep i've got two children in college and i'm going to have three by September<n>oh man<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt
and and the way they keep proposing fixing that is to raise taxes spend more money<n>i think what would cure that problem is to consolidate some of these schools and they wouldn't have so much money going to so many different schools<n>yeah well that plus that fact that you look into the we've got some very good private schools here and more and more people are sending their children private schools and what you look in the private schools is they've got a higher proportion of people on the payroll that are teaching<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh and and get them in the classroom plus<n>uh i don't know it seems to me that that more so than when i went to school there are a lot of courses that aren't going allow first first of all they're not college prep courses and i don't think they're going<n>help a person make a living they're just sort of things to get the kids their twenty one credits so they can graduate<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt
well<n>now if they propose this the if this you know state income tax goes through are they going to lower the sales tax<n>i don't know i i don't i bet they're not i i'll absolutely bet they're not it it's interesting i wish i knew this question was coming up because i've only heard of it in bits and pieces<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt
i don't know i i don't i bet they're not i i'll absolutely bet they're not it it's interesting i wish i knew this question was coming up because i've only heard of it in bits and pieces<n>but apparently there was a bill before the federal legislature today to uh lower social security tax but the other end of it they were going to raise income taxes<n>oh man<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh man<n>they were going to they were going to give with one hand and take away with the other and i i just heard bits and pieces on the radio today and i i hadn't uh uh i haven't heard that i haven't heard that much about it<n>uh what what kind of a sales tax was in Indiana Indiana<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt

i i don't know uh<n>i think they just ought to you know start uh just go all all the way you know new products introduced or whatever you know start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts and you know people if they have to are going to learn to think that way<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2669-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>you know liters of gasoline people are going to learn to think in metric as long as you can still buy a product in the English units that's how you're going to think of it<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2669-ms98-a-trans.txt
points yeah so<n>i don't know i think as long as people have a choice they're going to stick with the American way<n>i<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2669-ms98-a-trans.txt
most of the body parts seem to be metric and most of the engine parts seem to be SAE so it's<n>well i guess it just gets bad down to you got to you got to have one and not mix them up because you're never going to get to one one system if you still still got a got a mix<n>it's just crazy<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2669-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah<n>because they ask me why are there two bridges going into Dallas<n>darned if i know  i was blank looking you know i felt really dumb<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2690-ms98-a-trans.txt

but<n>i don't you know i think i think restrictions are going to be needed but no no bans or anything like that<n>it's kind of hard though because in different regions different regions like you were saying is uh is different like there where you're at you wouldn't mind having a gun so you you're really<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2700-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i think i think well around seven or eight restricting certain kinds and and leaving others out with restrictions but i don't know what that you know like you were saying the uh the seven day restriction or seven day wait period or something like that<n>well supposedly in seven days they're going they're going to look through y our background and make sure you are not an ex-con or don't have<n>what does that mean that that really doesn't you know it's just because it gives them time to look you up doesn't mean i mean it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2700-ms98-a-trans.txt

i think well i don't i really have uh really relaxed standards about how well organized and cleaned it is i mean it has to be basically clean because<n>you have to be organized enough enough to know where things are to be able to find things if it gets too messy you spend your whole life going through trying to find what you need<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2705-ms98-a-trans.txt
i i mean compared to the other mothers here on my street that don't work i mean my house is just it looks horrible compared to theirs<n>but i mean you have to decide what you're going to do you know if you going to<n>that's right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2705-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's right<n>you know you have to decide is the house going to run your life or are you going to run your life yeah you just<n>right exactly<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2705-ms98-a-trans.txt

um-hum<n>that you we can we'll be be uh asking for more than we bought the house for three years ago but the closing costs are going to eat out just about all of it so<n>so maybe you can get enough to cover that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2705-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah then we'll feel really we'll feel good about it<n>so are you you you you're basically going to have to sell that one before you can<n>so<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2705-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh my perception of the budget you know the government and they have so much to spend and there's not enough money to spread around but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries<n>and that we have more money or goods you know more money going out and too many goods coming into this country you know  and um<n>you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2708-ms98-a-trans.txt
and and obviously the the demand for their goods is quite high here so they can get their goods in here<n>and um you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know we're going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours<n>but um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2708-ms98-a-trans.txt
they're in<n>i think you're you're going to find that just because the United States you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh<n>uh the money you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell you know we don't uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2708-ms98-a-trans.txt

and you know they're just extremely bright kids and also they value learning<n>i was going to say i'm not sure i i would guess that it's not that they are any brighter but they just maybe work harder or<n>well i i think things come easy for them too but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States i don't<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt
well and exactly that's exactly true plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back<n>and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them and and uh plus a lot of American dollars but in in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too you know you just don't know<n>right right exactly<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-hum<n>homeless people going to the hospital and and being thrown out because they have no insurance and having to go to someplace else you know it would be nice if<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2716-ms98-a-trans.txt
that would be a nice thing<n>kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan because i just feel like everything the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly and it's going to be six times more expensive as what<n>yeah no that that is certainly true but i wonder about like in Canada in Canada where everybody everybody um automatically has insurance in Canada<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2716-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's true that's true<n>and in England at least at the time i was familiar with it about ten years ago they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was going to be<n>no oh so you don't get any choices at all or anything<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2716-ms98-a-trans.txt
right which is ridiculous<n>and right and so no matter what happens to me if i get in to a car accident this afternoon i have no idea you know  no way of being able to afford the outrageous medical cost because my insurance is now only eighty percent of what ever it's going to be<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2716-ms98-a-trans.txt
everybody else<n>and and what if they are lucky enough to get into a doctor and a program that's going to say okay well you really need to have those varicose veins or fixed or your teeth fixed or something like that and i'm paying for it<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2716-ms98-a-trans.txt

well it's kind of it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that it it it<n>uh there's i think X number of people out there that are going to commit murders<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2717-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>yeah the only consolation is so many of the murders are you know the the violent people going against each other and so they you know society's not going to put them to death well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to<n>uh i think<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2717-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh i think<n>i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say you know this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2717-ms98-a-trans.txt
i don't think much of life of life imprisonment first of all it's never turns out to be life but second you know why should we<n>the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again well then<n>why bother just execute them because that's that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2717-ms98-a-trans.txt
the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again well then<n>why bother just execute them because that's that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2717-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-huh<n>um you know he would come home and and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to decide you know after<n>the the penalty phase yeah they've decide the penalty separately from the verdict<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2717-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and that's you know that's the way they wanted to do it and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he uh you know some people on the case were<n>were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but i mean when it all came down they just<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2717-ms98-a-trans.txt
and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life<n>that you know you never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not<n>yeah yeah i agree<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2717-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>because i'm like you i'm not going to have a balance on that thing because it's too easy<n>i know too many people that pay off that card well i've got this credit card well maybe i'd better use that one or something like that and i'm saying huh-uh not me<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2718-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah so in that particular school system um that was that was one of the problems and<n>i guess one of the reasons the administrators uh were were putting so much pressure on him was uh the parents were going to them saying you know my Johnny or my Mary is smarter than that and blah blah blah and they can't fail and so<n>oh you know and that's really bad because that's really hurting them in the long run because up here at college now um we are so far behind the foreign students<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2720-ms98-a-trans.txt

how it doesn't it does inconvenience you but it could save lives i think is the way we look at it here and we're seeing so many murders um  between uh in in Washington DC<n>well do you think though that i mean if you have to wait seven days in order to purchase a gun are they really going to do these background checks and and if they really<n>well i think the i think the long run is is to get um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2721-ms98-a-trans.txt
is to get and this is very active in the politics politics here in Maryland now then  the long run there's also there's a bill being trying to be passed right now i guess through federal the federal legislature on um  instant checkups a a total computerized system<n>i've heard about that but they say it's so so going to be so expensive they'll never do it<n>right and it's year it's years away but it it will be<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2721-ms98-a-trans.txt
um until they can do it automatically on a large computerized system<n>yeah but what what's going to happen to the uh purchasing of guns illegally i meant i meant the guy who shot Brady was he had he purchased his gun many months before he actually committed the deed<n>oh sure  that's<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2721-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-huh<n>i don't know uh that that's my impression people don't do the outsides as often i know in this neighborhood it seemed like last year everybody was going crazy to have their exterior painted and that was the the first time for most people<n>but that's just trim right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2748-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-huh<n>so i'm going to have to ask her what the trick is she'll probably say hire me to come down and do it<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2748-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah yeah well i don't yeah that's right i don't i don't know i guess maybe the trick with the pads on the ceiling is that<n>you have to put a minimal amount of paint on there you probably aren't going to be able to cover as much of a surface as you would if you're doing it on a wall because if it drips you can just sort of smooth it all out uh<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2748-ms98-a-trans.txt

i know it's it's it's kind of kind of crazy but i don't know but but until they until they meet the standards that you know that i'm used to anyway that you know i'll i'll buy what whatever i get you know that's best for my money<n>yeah and you know like i said i've had i've had great luck with the Hondas and it's kind of hard to walk away from a good thing when it's you know you're not sure what you're going to get when you change<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2801-ms98-a-trans.txt
i know it really is and<n>we just need not to buy the stuff and those businesses will have to change you know the corporations and so forth have to change if you don't buy it they're not going to make it so<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>uh aware of it like they are today and i think that's where it has to start with the kids because it's going to be their world soon and i think it and and we're real big on you know Plano which is a small suburb of Dallas about a hundred thousand<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah Raleigh has has curbside recycling which is really nice<n>well you know it just has to be when you consider the landfills we we're not going to have any soon and it's<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>it's ridiculous but the thing the quandary that i'm in is that that we had a great big article in in in the newspaper last week about i've been real big about going to to the store and asking for paper instead of plastic well<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt
see that much of a problem as opposed to a petroleum product i mean tree trees can grow back<n>if if they're handled in the correct way but the petroleum products like plastic i mean they're going to run out of oil whatever they're going to do<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt
be a part of a yeah a world that's halfway decent and you know just in my lifetime i've seen such a change in the environment and it's scary because by the time my kids have kids<n>and they're growing up it's going to be a completely different world you know and it's it's scary so<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt
you could easily say well we should go back to living in caves<n>but no one's going to do that so i think you need to make compromises slowly enough people adjust to it<n>and uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt
i don't know i guess it's just me but i don't know whether to trust that or not<n>i mean there are so many scams and things going on you know i would love to help somebody<n>i know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2803-ms98-a-trans.txt
in Dallas they<n>i was going to say because i i heard uh in fact i was talking to someone from Dallas uh just last week they was saying that uh in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for TI and she had gone over seas to Tokyo<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2803-ms98-a-trans.txt
hum<n>so i'm hoping he's going to blossom and make me a rich man someday<n>yeah  that'd be nice<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2804-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>well i'm definitely looking forward to going to a few games this summer that's good entertainment at a budget price<n>yeah you said you were a Cincinnati fan has uh all this brouhah a with Pete Rose over the years<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2804-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>right yeah you need to be on higher ground sometime you don't want the if there if it's going to rain you don't want the water to run down into your tents so<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2805-ms98-a-trans.txt
or biology department one or the other anyway uh and anyway he just he went and found this guy in in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one in<n>i guess in Texas in Mexico i don't know where but anyway he brought this home and i looked at him and i said you've got to be kidding i'm not going to live with a lizard  but you know i visualize that animal racing about<n>and you know like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that they're very much like uh well the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2806-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and it's much less than clear to me that as a military power um there's going to be anything left uh given that anything like that happens<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt
um<n>and they so so i guess since the primary question is whether or not it's a military problem that's less than clear to me i mean if they're smart they're just going to let us head toward communism on our own very merry way<n>that's right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt
i see<n>i don't think they're going to you know somehow import communism to us<n>i i agree with that i don't believe that will happen<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>oh well so that's uh what what's going to be real interesting is if when they have the next presidential elections<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>if Bush is going to run with Quayle again<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>or if he's going to run with someone else which i think would be uh i wonder if that's if there's precedent for that where uh there's uh same president but a different vice president<n>uh i think so i can't think off hand who<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>uh and uh that's i you know i'd love to see that happen but i doubt it's going to happen in the next fifty years<n>you don't think so<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt
personally i i i really as i said i would really love to see it happen but i just<n>i just i can't see them maintaining the missile bases in fact i think if the Soviet government starts retreating you know because of these civil wars and stuff the first thing they're going to do is close down the mi ssile bases in the republics<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh under the fear<n>because they're not going to want them to fall into the Republic's hands<n>i see under the fear that that uh Moscow Moscow gets bombed first that's a good point that's a very good point in fact<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt
might be used against them that's right<n>and so i think just from that there's going to be some limited amounts of disarmament they'll still be republics with the missiles the ones that are under the firmer control of the of the Soviets<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh really<n>nevertheless it's not exactly the thing that's going to make you bucks<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt
so<n>you know so there's that end of it too and and i think it's going to really<n>you know so i don't<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>it sure going to make a big difference in our school system<n>yeah it is<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>in order to accommodate the extra teaching that's going to be needed<n>because they're eliminating all aids<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt
because they're eliminating all aids<n>they're going to they all aids all paid aids everything is going to have to be volunteer through the parent teacher organizations<n>oh really<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt
but that's<n>that's amazing because if if every child does that what are they going to do with all that<n>yeah it's a lot of money<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and uh i think we're going to be seeing alternative calendar very soon i i'm still basically against it although i i do understand the positives<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt
how did y'all come to uh to uh make the seventy three your your collector's item you might say<n>well it just this this gentleman had this car and uh you know he had he had told my fiance that he was going to sell it i mean he just i mean he sold it to us for like three hundred bucks you know and<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2811-ms98-a-trans.txt
the mainstay yeah<n>going out and working now whether it be because of finances or just the economy uh the mother's not there anymore and the children are i think i think a lot of society is suffering not to say that women shouldn't<n>and restructuring stuff families yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
and restructuring stuff families yeah<n>you know go out and do what they want to do but i think that um society's going to really have to get used to it and they're not quite used to it yet and that's i<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
right um-hum<n>i mean i'm the typical baby boomer i hate that term but in terms of women  women going out i mean twenty three i remember that<n>uh-huh  yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah you want to establish<n>and and get there quick and then worry about you know because right now in my career i'm i'm really starting out and it's going to take me a while to move up and i don't need anything kind of holding me back um<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men<n>i i just turned twenty three uh April twentieth and i'm still going you know oh my God i'm getting so old i just because me myself i just like to move really really quickly<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
when when the age creeps up where i'm twenty three and twenty four i'm thinking my time is running out you know but i'm actually very very young<n>yeah you are because what i was going to say is what you'll find is my background is in journalism and corporate communications and what you'll find is i mean i'm just now<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>finally to a point where i mean i don't know why i didn't didn't do it sooner but this is probably typical of the women's movement too the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway if you want to go back to school i'm seriously considering going back to school for law<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
it's true i mean it's it's<n>you know and so i'm going i'm so old and i'm i i really have to always tell myself no you're not you're very young and you know so it's<n>no you're extremely yeah it's it's just well it's like us we're getting ready to do if possible for an adoption and i have friends that say well why would you do that if you know you haven't been able to children which we do know why would you do that now at this part point and um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum yeah very true<n>um but what i was going to say about mothers is uh your mother probably just won't say it but i mean my mother and her sisters are always saying uh to my cousins and i my female cousins<n>you girls are so lucky because quote unquote you have all these choices you know you went to school you can do this you can do that we couldn't do that then and my cousins and i go well why couldn't you  and they<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>i think his stuff is is great just going back to his very early works and almost anything he writes i try to read<n>uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2813-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh<n>for finding out what's going on in fields other than your own<n>yeah have have you ever heard of the Source Book Project<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2813-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>um i'm kind of in to that i'm uh uh i belong to the Narragansett Archeology Society so i like going back and you know<n>digging up things it gives me you know uh it's kind of a a thrill to see something that nobody's looked at for two or three thousand years<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2813-ms98-a-trans.txt
well<n>that's that's something um yeah we have it's a very timely subject i think in the Spring everybody decides that they're going to start over and do something with their house<n>and we started last year an we have a little i guess it's a sixteen hundred foot house and it's just my husband and i here but um we decided that uh we wanted to build a sun room<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt
i don't know i i guess you get this idea that everything should be perfect and you know what this isn't a perfect world<n>no however i do think that a lot of times contractors try to get out of doing things that they say they're going to do and uh<n>it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i was real happy with our contractor um actually i wasn't happy with the contractor i was happy with the job foreman so i think that made all the difference because he was pretty um you know<n>concerned about how it looked and and you know how it should be done the right way and he gave us a lot of clues you just wish you knew all this stuff going in that um<n>it was funny because we didn't understand a lot of things that we had to do in addition to this you know like the tape and bedding and and doing finishing off this wall and that wall that wasn't in the contract you know kind of thing<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt
i want someone to do it for me<n>and uh just trying to get them to do what they say they're going to do is a real effort<n>yeah well we've taken this another step further this year we're going to build a deck we've got some people building uh a deck out in the back you know to complete sort of the back yard kind of thing and um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh just trying to get them to do what they say they're going to do is a real effort<n>yeah well we've taken this another step further this year we're going to build a deck we've got some people building uh a deck out in the back you know to complete sort of the back yard kind of thing and um<n>well i could recommend something there if if you know if if it's not just cost prohibitive<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt
they're screws the self adhesive screws all right<n>yeah those and so they're not going to split and and i was really concerned about bugs really when i when we were considering other types of wood because you know termites can be a real hazard around here<n>you have to pretty much spray them regularly you know under an and around or whatever so you want to leave yourself uh enough space to get under it or or be able to lift it up<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt
well it is it's it's a frightening experience<n>the one thing you might do if he will deliver the boards that he is going to make the under structure with<n>it sure is<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt
huh-uh now the third part is and it was supposed to have started in May but something and i don't remember the exact reason from Persian Gulf um<n>trickle down fouled that up and so now we're not going to do that until end of June but then they will give us another container that where we will put everything recyclable glass plastic<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2815-ms98-a-trans.txt
well that's good that's neat<n>oh that's going to be a lot of hard work though<n>well<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2815-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>well all of our um grocery stores are going to um<n>they have each of one i shop at i go to a Skaggs and Albertson's and a Kroger and they will let you bring in<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2815-ms98-a-trans.txt
no question about it well i just you know i'm really glad to see us a world coming back to this and<n>yeah it's really coming to a head it's been building up for a few years i remember this going on when i was a teenager<n>sure sure<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2815-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>that's a consideration too but i don't know it it would be a really rough choice to make you depending on the parent their personality and your own family and what's going on with<n>i'm home all day anyway with the young kids but if i was working you know full time and had to give up a career that would be another you know problem too but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt
it it would really be hard because when we go to visit i'm sure places have you know their best<n>foot forward kind of thing unless you drop in frequently and kind of get the since of what's going on behind the scenes it would really be hard to know it's kind of similar in away to some of the things you look for in going to try and find day care for your kids<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt
i thought how how neat you know that you can have a place where you can you know go down together and have dinner with other people because if your living alone the isolation and the depression and all those other factors should be taken into consideration too<n>so i thought you know they should have dorms for older people they had activities going on all the time and you know it was really a much more comfortable lifestyle i could imagine for an older person so yeah i think that would be great if they had places like that<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>instead of just being kind of taken away from all of that and told where you're going to be and what you're going to do in a nursing home<n>yeah it's she'll become uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah yeah<n>we're going to see you know geriatrics will be a a big part of the medical profession i think<n>yeah yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt
and if you<n>and it's it's the one that's going they're going downhill is it is it the one that needs needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or on the more mature one<n>of course<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2818-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh i don't know i think the middle class is shrinking and the uh<n>lower class is expanding and sooner or later there's going to there's going to be a turn around<n>oh yeah i agree<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2819-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>but i think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class uh<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2819-ms98-a-trans.txt
necessary<n>yeah for me i think that drug testing just it it follows the path that society's going in if more and more people are using drugs then i think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2820-ms98-a-trans.txt
so the only thing i would hate is if i were to go and uh i mean it's kind of the same thing with the lie detector  the lie detector test<n>if you don't have anything to hide you're not going to mind it<n>um-hum right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2820-ms98-a-trans.txt
i mean i i took a lie detector test once and it didn't i didn't mind it but i was just offended by some of the questions i guess i mean there was one question do you like your mother you know i said yes do you hate your mother no have you ever killed your mother<n>and i was just going you know what in the world<n>well those are just yeah those it turns out those are just to get a um probably to get some sort of<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2820-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>they ask that i was going what in the world are you asking me about here you know it's just<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2820-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>you're not going to believe this i have to tell you this if i don't because you're in Plano that<n>that's okay<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2821-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah now they're real good yeah they're good<n>there had oh and my husband's going upstairs and he said and free ice cream  i didn't know they had that oh i can't talk i had chocolate Bavarian tort for desert today which i never eat at lunch and it was wonderful<n>yeah yeah free ice cream yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2821-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>well that's all right as long as that i was going to say because with six people how do you um with two we have a problem<n>i mean i can't even imagine you know trying to uh you sound like you're doing pretty well there with four children<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2821-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah but uh<n>i don't know i guess the uh the personal computer is it's really uh going to be a necessity that you know children should learn to use it i was just commenting i teach uh a couple accounting classes<n>and uh i was just commenting the other night that it's uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2822-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh i was just commenting the other night that it's uh<n>going to reach the point where um accounting classing in college have to have computer for the students to use you know in every class uh right now i teach over at Brookhaven College<n>and there's only one class that i happen to teach that that teaches the accounting students anything about using the computer<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2822-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>okay now a friend of mine is trying is going for CPA and she is having to take<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2822-ms98-a-trans.txt
or she maybe maybe it's just a preference that she's taking it on herself but she is taking a computer class<n>yeah and uh but yeah it's that's something that's going to be uh a necessity for accountants because you you know it's you can do so much for more work with a computer then you can do you know doing it manually<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2822-ms98-a-trans.txt
but you know and so we try not to even take that as part of our budget we just try to put that right away in savings<n>it's very difficult sometimes to to not think and say well God we have a little bit in savings let's you know but you have to be quite um adamant and say you're not going to touch that so<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and and there i don't think there's a lot of opportunity uh in the future for grants and loans and that kind of stuff because i don't i just don't think it's going to be there<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>so i think if parents don't provide it's it's not going to be there<n>it's too hard<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh<n>who knows how much that's going to take i mean what we're taking out now may be enough it may not be and uh just don't know or there may be far more there than is ever needed but if it's if it's extra<n>yeah yeah exactly<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>but we've always managed you know to you know to get out of it fairly quickly we don't have a lot charged up on credit cards we don't have you know a lot of money going out<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt
i i project ahead i usually at the end of the month when i when i pay the bills i'll usually<n>project what i'm going to need for next month but i don't really put it aside i just you know i just try to estimate what i think it's going to come to and then<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt
and within about a month i would say i had ten fifteen calls from different brokers uh asking me questions all sorts of things about what i would be willing interested in investing in and how much i had to invest and<n>and i was kind of curious and i guess i got my answer but it was uh a bit much and to this day it has continued considerably it's i guess it's going to be hard to get off of that little list now<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt
credit references uh when you dial that in to find out well what's their latest rating uh that kind of information you don't always want everybody to know but uh<n>it's going across uh computer lines and people can pick up what they want so<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>uh you know you name anything that's ever happened to you is going to be tied into either your social security number or your driver's license<n>it's kind of sad that they choose that number to identify you  with because there's very few you know some people use it just because it's easy and it's unique and then some people use it to yeah you can now identify that person it's not quite so private anymore<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh i don't know i very little of the information i give out really bothers me but as far as whether i care if anybody else had it<n>but uh i guess the idea that if you ever let it become a an all right thing to do for the masses then you'll never be able to get that privilege back  once gone it's going to be gone forever<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt

could very well be<n>oh oh well i was wondering how that that worked because it's like you know we'll pay you for and i'm going wait a minute<n>you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2987-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's right<n>but i mean you have kids you have kids going to school with guns knives that's that's from the home but you know it's i don't know i guess parents aren't<n>and i think the school i think<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2988-ms98-a-trans.txt
i think uh i don't know what the solution is if the government doesn't know how are the um there's somebody that needs to rise up<n>and have a plan that is going to resolve the many issues that are facing the public school system and i wouldn't know where to start since i haven't been involved in<n>the public school system that much<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2988-ms98-a-trans.txt
gone through that uh i remember my parents didn't do all those type things and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that and even now with my grandchildren i feel it's a very important thing to be done<n>right because if uh kids don't look up to you or or can't can't feel they can spend time with you they're going to find someone else and uh<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2989-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and so uh we never could agree on what we were going to listen to after we got married because i'd want to listen hear country and he'd want to hear rock and we couldn't get along because his rock was too rock for me i like soft rock but i don't like some of the heavy metal stuff he was listening to<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2990-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>so all that music brings back a lot of memories you know and i'm always thinking oh i'd like to have one of those albums but since we made this agreement that we're going to listen to Christian music i think oh well i'll probably set it on the shelf and  would never you know play it<n>let's see<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2990-ms98-a-trans.txt
and you have to you know be familiar with the like there're so many different software packages<n>it you have to be familiar with the one that you're going to be using most<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2991-ms98-a-trans.txt
right exactly<n>how many lines you're going to use in it and<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2991-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>they typeset they don't usually break words in a newspaper if the if one line is going to be a lot shorter than another line they just they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2991-ms98-a-trans.txt
but some of them are and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that it that just a a basic general user can understand them so i think um<n>people think it's going to take them a lot longer to learn it properly than it really would and so they're really wasting time rather than saving themselves time because they think well it's quicker just to do it myself when it's really not<n>right um-hum it's better to learn it directly from the manual<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2991-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>it's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing you know not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff and they usually<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2992-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum um-hum<n>my son older son he's going to be five and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now so<n>oh that's true that's true well i noticed that my kids are uh older now they're uh getting close to the teenage years but they did we watched all of Mister Rogers and everything but even some of your uh cartoons can be very violent<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2992-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh so that's really funny  but uh we've gotten uh-huh go ahead<n>i  i was just going to say i know that<n>at least before our kids were born we used to always enjoy watching the Cosby Show Thursday nights usually had pretty good with that and as far as um very good comedy<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2992-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and uh so uh i we're not going to be in the market for in the near future for any new car<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2993-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah have a nice summer<n>thank you you too it's going to be a hot one okay bye-bye<n>yeah bye<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2993-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah that would be a real good idea<n>i'm trying to think if there's anything else i could think of they're talking about going to curbside pickup in our in our city  Rowlett Texas do you know do you where that is<n>where do you live<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2994-ms98-a-trans.txt
hm nah i didn't know that because we just usually if we're gonna um buy sodas they're in the the two liter bottles<n>yeah that's what we buy the most of unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to put the cans in a cooler<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2994-ms98-a-trans.txt
but if people don't use the telephone it's like i don't know when the police has their<n>project going and i don't know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things that's the only way i know<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2995-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah oh definitely  seems like<n>although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe there'll be a day that they're going to uh enact this i think uh<n>the um other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling so they keep trying to say we may need a uh state income tax<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2996-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>i guess maybe if i was going to buy a car or something maybe i would consider where i was buying it to try to you know save a little bit on that sales tax because on a car that really matters kind of mounts up<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2996-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>i thought i was going to do that Christmas eve and i couldn't find hardly anything open  after five o'clock in the afternoon and i was oh i was i really i really was stuck<n>were you shocked like oh no i'm stuck i need to buy stuff<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2996-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-huh<n>and so that's where i've been ever since and so i don't regret uh not going into military service<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2997-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>jump from whatever it was going to be from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be<n>yeah you don't throw the baby out with the bath water and condemning nuclear use<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2998-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah right uh-huh<n>Dean Ferrings uh uh restaurant which is the Mansion on Turtle Creek i mean we've got beautiful places to go you can get as dressed up or as you know just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3000-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-huh<n>now they're going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors so it's almost like a um uh an HMO<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3001-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>you know kind of thing that uh only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage if you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3001-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i pay for the extra dental plus so much more per month<n>because it always seems like if you're going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3001-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh i like to think about that<n>after you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go is that all that's in there i don't think's it's going to pay too long when i get out<n>um we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3001-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and they took the dental away but now i think they're going to start getting into eye<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3001-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh oh no<n>a little bit that worries me because i feel like the news is so biased and yes they report facts and yes you can get an idea of what's going on but<n>oh yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3002-ms98-a-trans.txt
so i guess news is just part of that rat race for me<n>and my wife and i feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own it's always there's something going on all the time uh you don't really have time to sit down and<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3002-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know<n>well i guess we're going to talk about children today<n>okay let's do it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3004-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children  so she uh she spends a lot of quality time i think when she is with with the children<n>oh is that  is that right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3004-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh she she also had a small child she brought with her and it did not work out uh<n>at all  it she thought it was going to she was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out in the morning but uh<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3004-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum yeah yeah<n>uh it worked out good i'm going to i've decided i'm going to babysit my two granddaughters<n>oh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3004-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh<n>since they'll be going back at the end of the month and<n>that's great<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3004-ms98-a-trans.txt

yep<n>but when those when those people leave uh the power's going to go um there isn't really anything here because we're not really big enough so the economy is going to going to suffer i think because the the<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3005-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>so those are going to get uh uh the squeaky wheel gets the oil they're going to they're going to catch it and somebody has to do it somebody has to do the work like Boeing or General Dynamics or wherever wherever they happen to be you know you've you've only got a few plane factories or<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3005-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh i can't even remember which of the companies it is but they've they've got a they've got a tilt rotor<n>uh plane that they've developed and they want to sell but developed for the defense department department and defense department is saying well no we we don't we don't really need it it's going to be too expensive and it's not going to do what we need and<n>oh like the yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3005-ms98-a-trans.txt
hm<n>i may be concerned about the number of calories that are going into the spread i know i watch my weight and i'm sure that most of my friends do too and i appreciate somebody being conscious of that when i go visit<n>so i do try to cook more healthy than i did even five years ago five years ago i let my palate dictate uh now i'm more conscious along with everybody else<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3006-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>everything to an extreme and i'm not going to take the flavor and the pleasure out of the food in order to make it quote healthy i'd rather die than eat terrible tasting food<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3006-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>well of course now we're going to find out two years down the road that we've done something terrible and our body is going to<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3006-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb<n>dumb retrievers and i'm and i really fear for the breed because i love that breed but i really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3007-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah they did<n>i i had never really had a golden retriever before we were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband's family had had shepherds and all the other we looked at some of shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very<n>uh social and stuff and we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down and one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling  and that was mine<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3007-ms98-a-trans.txt
even um uh police corps which started you know finding other breeds to use because this thing this this thing known as a German shepherd here its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible<n>so about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this so they went back to Europe<n>and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3007-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh that's right<n>yes because it just keeps going an up up and up there too<n>but uh there's<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3008-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah uh my son has worked for a company for about six year he graduated from college what in eighty six so five years this fall<n>and he started out with they had a Four O One K plan and he asked me if he should get into it and i said well very small amount uh you can put in there and you keep adding to it and they're going to match it or so and<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3008-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>so she was going on those two instincts just the same i know myself i never and i was very very protective on who babysit my children<n>oh i would be too<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3009-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>you you learn a lot by going in there and they explain they explain to you you know what their day consists of and what their general rules are and um<n>that's you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3009-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>right and then you know i mean even at that you have to consider the logistics of it you know i mean you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3009-ms98-a-trans.txt
true that's true um i i'm a very selective watcher i i look at the TV section and<n>decide what i'm going to watch and watch it but as a rule i don't sort of  stroll around the dial and<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3010-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh okay well here we go<n>i guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that are that did some stuff over in the Gulf um<n>yeah no did you push one oh okay okay well then i think it i just started doing this so i don't know too much about it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3012-ms98-a-trans.txt
and that's the way the course that they should go i mean you know we can maybe help them a little bit prompt them but i don't think this intervention at such high levels<n>should be going on the the thing with Israel and Palestine i believe that should be settled between them and also um you know<n>the other thing is their idea or our idea idea of democracy has nothing to do with them<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3012-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and that's if you know if somewhere in there someone's going to have to learn a different way<n>that's yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3012-ms98-a-trans.txt
i i i just think you know you're right and i think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along<n>it's not going to be that we're going to uh you know sort of tell them to go to their room and that's going to solve the whole problem it's going to be them<n>yeah but that's the type of thing they understand they don't understand any other way and so at that at that you have to work at their level to an extent too<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3012-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's right<n>um you know there are political boundaries and those are man made boundaries but you know for heaven sakes that's something that's been going on for ages and<n>and i i think so much of it is what you're taught<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3012-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-hum yeah<n>yeah i i've been working we're going to have a baby this summer and i'm not going to work anymore yeah so hopefully i think i'll enjoy cooking more when i don't have to work all day i don't like to come home and<n>oh how exciting<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3013-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know we could learn to talk about things and i think that's good<n>yeah that really is it keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other<n>yeah i think<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3013-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh uh-huh<n>and if they're going to have other kids over then then they help and we make real simple things you know those oh i don't i don't know if you've ever made them maybe not since you don't have kids yet but those JELL-O<n>uh gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers i can't think of what they call it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3013-ms98-a-trans.txt
and that and i'd rather have a Maxima than a Cadillac<n>i really would it's not necessarily prestige but it's comfort uh there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car uh<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3014-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah oh wow we like the stuff that glitters<n>good there's nothing wrong with that actually i think probably if i were going to get uh if i were going to be practical which doesn't mean i would be i would prefer white<n>right well practically yes that's<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3014-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh um-hum<n>but if i'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time i want some real good classical music i love classical music and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3014-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh the reason i quite was just because the the doctor a a certain doctor that we enjoyed<n>enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that HMO so we my wife decided she wanted to to stay with that doctor so  we went to the to the<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3015-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>because they don't have to worry about going in and and paying<n>uh seventy five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3015-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>the horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and uh it being a four thousand dollar bill<n>well they and then again they're also  they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay you know they they get a lot of uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3015-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>a lot of uh people who are just just have to be there and can't afford it and so they they know they're not going to get paid you know get money from them so they<n>yeah yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3015-ms98-a-trans.txt
and so that's one way one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by uh okay if you'll shorten your stay then we will uh waive the deductible<n>right our our insurance is uh is doing something similar where they're also going  to more<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3015-ms98-a-trans.txt
i think that is so stupid you know because<n>oh i'm guilty of that sometimes because i've called and there really wasn't any significant message and i and i wasn't going to be available to be called back<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3016-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and it was sort of like oh the hell i'm not going to spend the time giving and leaving a message and uh i'll call later  if i'm available the other thing that um that there is recourse to and that's another thing is<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3016-ms98-a-trans.txt

now the adults are more aware of it and the children are being taught in the schools more<n>it'll be you know on down the road this is going to be passed on which is good<n>absolutely yes uh of course uh we would like to see it accelerated because uh of the critical nature of it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3063-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>oh yeah and it's not just paying back what you've charged it's paying that and half again uh you send in uh uh fifty dollars you're going to pay twenty twenty five in interest charges<n>that's right that's right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3064-ms98-a-trans.txt

that circulates and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top<n>and then that's the way it's kept in order and then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion<n>you don't feel like i don't know anything about this person you've you've read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth so you are kind of half way acquainted that way<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3067-ms98-a-trans.txt
and then that's the way it's kept in order and then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion<n>you don't feel like i don't know anything about this person you've you've read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth so you are kind of half way acquainted that way<n>that's a good idea<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3067-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>we tried to start that in my husband's family his mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago and i said well let's start this letter<n>and it just never  my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got i sent it on to the next one and and but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in Scottsdale Arizona for that family<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3067-ms98-a-trans.txt
we tried to start that in my husband's family his mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago and i said well let's start this letter<n>and it just never  my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got i sent it on to the next one and and but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in Scottsdale Arizona for that family<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3067-ms98-a-trans.txt

um-hum<n>and the kid at that age especially if they're going into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want an and i mean choosing from my experience you know my i thought you know my i know what i want a lot more than my parents know what i want<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt
i hate to talk to the parents because um<n>one of the reasons is because you know the kid doesn't know exactly what they want and i always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not going to be your career vocation<n>because you'll get better grades i i think most employers would probably rather hire you know a a three six in um  in history uh to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt
that make sense<n>yeah i always you know tell them that you should major in something you you're going to get good grades in because that that's always i think more important<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>yeah yeah i think uh i would agree with that in fact the thing that i'm going through the same thing where in graduate school i was trying to choose you know a particular institution might be better<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt
but i don't yeah i think you're right you really have to think about that for the job i went to a very small state college when i got my bachelor's<n>and when i now i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs i was going to be a teacher i was just a high school teacher so<n>most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of you know but then when i went um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i i guess another thing that concerns me is uh so many people it seems like everybody today is still in that  job market  and uh<n>um where was i at oh going in going to school you get taught<n>the things you learn in school but there is also a whole other dimension i mean the growing up while you're going to school part<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt
um where was i at oh going in going to school you get taught<n>the things you learn in school but there is also a whole other dimension i mean the growing up while you're going to school part<n>um-hum yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh i know sometimes i just i'm in it just takes a very long time so<n>does it yeah i've been trying to you know do that and and sometimes i just can't wait that long so i just hang up because it keeps going through the thing over and over again<n>yeah i know well<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3069-ms98-a-trans.txt
and um<n>you know a lot of  hanky-panky going on<n>yeah yeah that kind of was um kind of a pop psychology time for when when a lot of books like that were coming out i think<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3069-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and now i i mean i think it's around here somewhere i'm just going to have to put it in the car sometimes and listen to it<n>right i wouldn't be surprised yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3069-ms98-a-trans.txt
right i wouldn't be surprised yeah<n>sure oh yeah well i read that and then i'm trying to think um usually i try to to find something long that i'm going to do<n>but um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3069-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>when if if i have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or you know when i know i'm not going to be doing anything for a while um<n>yeah oh that's what i do too<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3069-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah i think so<n>the you know it's it sometimes it will skip like my husband is not musical at all but his mother is very musical and um and his children are very musical so  you never know where the talent is going to show up i guess sometimes<n>so um  well i'm not sure how long we've talked i haven't paid haven't been paying attention to the to the clock but uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3071-ms98-a-trans.txt

um-hum<n>well it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along ours ours is still kind of loosely organized and the same people usually get stuck with doing it and<n>yeah well<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3082-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i i i i think that the biggest problem is uh with the uh with the the home environment being part of it you know if<n>i think too many parents expect uh the the school to teach uh the moral aspects of of things to the students to the kids and you know while we're not going to worry about uh<n>teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt
teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then uh<n>expect them to to pick it up at school and you're not going to do that you know you're going to carry carry with carry to school uh out into the world you know what you learned at home and uh<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt
the uh schools like that that where you got a lot of kids who are basically uh<n>that might be more well to well off you know going to a private Catholic school or whatever uh and and they're not all that way but you know some that are um<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>that they're they're they're not quite the same as as the kids that are going to the inner city uh you know public schools<n>yeah this is interesting because i in my mind i don't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment but uh this this was actually inner city<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt
they didn't send him to a public school you know you have like you said you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance<n>well you know in a lot of cases uh like that where you know if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it's it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving them<n>uh uh an education it shows i think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know and that may be<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh i think that's a big part of it you know people you know if you don't care about property and people you know<n>you're not going to care about uh<n>about learning i think<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>you know you're not going to really care about yourself<n>yeah that's what i was going to say it's the chicken and the egg thing i wonder a lot of times<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know you're not going to really care about yourself<n>yeah that's what i was going to say it's the chicken and the egg thing i wonder a lot of times<n>you know people i mean a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools you know vandalism wise and you go to<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt
and it is true and uh i but i think that would but as far as looking for a place<n>you know i i the criteria i mean i think it's very important to have very caring people you know to take care of the the in a school if you're going to have the structure and you're going to have the large numbers you're going to need really<n>oh absolutely without a doubt um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3085-ms98-a-trans.txt
i recently stopped by McDonald's and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children<n>and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center and of course she was she had just gotten her degree and she was so enthusiastic and she was excited about it and she was going to accomplish all of these things<n>yes yes<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3085-ms98-a-trans.txt

um-hum um-hum<n>to develop the kinds of things that that they're going to need to interact with other people i felt like i needed some strong influence there<n>yeah well that's different than most people do it i mean a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3085-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh and i was just really grateful i only had one bad child care experience it was in a home uh the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it she was from um  uh<n>uh Argentina and she was going back home and i couldn't just you know wait for eight three or four months and then bring them back to her so i had to find a new place<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3085-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>they learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they didn't learn but they're going to learn it sometime so but for the most part they did have good care<n>yeah yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3085-ms98-a-trans.txt

they were the ones that caused it or whatever but to me when you do the crime<n>then you should pay for whatever you did and and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge i don't i don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say oh well you know that was a breeze i can go out and do it again and you know<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3113-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah<n>of what's going on that so that's<n>and i don't know you know i i think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know are they put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>i don't know that that looks that bad but if you're going to tell the kids they can have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too<n>yeah it it i see that the i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers i think<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there you don't want to dress too tacky because you're  going to be in the same room with them<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt
well and you always course it's a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today or there there's<n>or you're going to be observed<n>there's usually yeah there's usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen and i i don't know how a coach would feel if that teaches health or<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt
or you're going to be observed<n>there's usually yeah there's usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen and i i don't know how a coach would feel if that teaches health or<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt
really and i don't know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the kids i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and<n>i don't think we'll ever get to that no i don't think i think we're going the opposite direction it's the parochial schools that i guess many times they've had uniforms for years i really don't really know if they still do<n>you don't think so<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i think it does it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete<n>Highland Park's thinking about going that route<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt
so it<n>and then i think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do<n>yeah i i don't think a lot of teachers are very professional but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3115-ms98-a-trans.txt
but how about you<n>yeah i i enjoy going out but my husband goes out for dinner a lot with his company you know with his work<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3116-ms98-a-trans.txt

right<n>and she ended up going to the University of Oklahoma<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3117-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>i think that for me it's going to be one of those things yes i want to make sure it has a good education but i also want to keep it small enough that you can enjoy it because Texas to me was almost too big<n>yeah i've heard that from people who have gone to Texas yeah i went to uh Iowa State which is also a big eight school like Oklahoma<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3117-ms98-a-trans.txt

i i think it's just i don't i mean i think it's as fair as it can possibly get but i just think it's really hard you know i mean some cases go on for years you know<n>that's true and i've never been on jury duty but they have to keep going and going and going<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3118-ms98-a-trans.txt

right<n>both at home they don't know what to expect at home they don't feel secure there they don't know what's going to happen just out front of their<n>apartment complex for example that child that was shot<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3134-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>would give them more security in going to the counselor if they have a rapport with their counselor now if they don't<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3134-ms98-a-trans.txt
because um education is the key to our future and uh if we have children who are not getting their education for one reason or another<n>than what are we going to do with them what's going to happen to them are they going to be<n>yeah that's right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3134-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah that's right<n>able to uh work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them that's no good<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3134-ms98-a-trans.txt
what happens when public education fails you know will then people go to private schools you know well what kind of a situation do they get there and what are you know and what kind of state are we in if<n>if most people are going to private schools<n>well i think uh one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3134-ms98-a-trans.txt
right right yeah<n>that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff<n>uh-huh yeah that is um a big drawback i think in that in the uh public schools out here<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3135-ms98-a-trans.txt
rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah<n>and with our budget cuts i'm sure that's not going to<n>well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3135-ms98-a-trans.txt
and with our budget cuts i'm sure that's not going to<n>well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes<n>not going to change anytime soon<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3135-ms98-a-trans.txt
well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes<n>not going to change anytime soon<n>oh my goodness<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3135-ms98-a-trans.txt
right right<n>but i  i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work two income families i think are here to stay<n>uh-huh uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3135-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>you know the the people that work in big business have families they have children so it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working and uh<n>right yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3135-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and so i think that we're going to try that i i think the<n>huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3136-ms98-a-trans.txt

isn't that something yeah<n>i was going to say my kids both eat it i guess that's one thing that i particularly like um but i think it's good for you know for for company too and i've made it a few times um and you can make a lot at one time<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3138-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>so or i give it to my Mom and Dad if i know we're not going to eat<n>what what does it have in it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3138-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah<n>there's they might be saving money i mean even if they had to pay more now i mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work even though it's higher productivity is short-term<n>that's right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3140-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>no we're i have uh one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler and one on the way<n>oh is<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3140-ms98-a-trans.txt
yes yes and i think uh it's becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while i think<n>home schooling's always been around but uh i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools um and a lot of it is discipline problems<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3140-ms98-a-trans.txt
i don't know something's got to change with the schools that's what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway when they're young<n>well i think it's going to have to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else the home is the base<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3140-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>well i'm thinking of a next time about going back to a dog though because the cats really do shed a lot you just never get rid of the cat hair<n>do they<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3141-ms98-a-trans.txt
we never back then you didn't spay and neuter your animals that much you just kind of put up with whatever happened and she could never get rid of them fast enough before the next litter came along it wasn't usual unusual for us to have six and seven cats and<n>i remember my first camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of them that were going to be award winning type  photos they've always been a part of my life<n>well i guess so you've had them so you had them just from early on then<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3141-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>especially if you really do get attached to them i'm i'm already kind of preparing for Prissy dying because she's pretty old and fat and oh i just know it's going to come sooner or later so that's one reason i've been letting Emily talk about dogs because i think<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3141-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>we we say that's going to be the end but i think when it really comes to it we'll want another pet<n>how old is Prissy<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3141-ms98-a-trans.txt
and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal and sometimes<n>it's i enjoy going out having a formal meal<n>yes<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3142-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and uh not in Plano  of course  but we really we really do enjoy going out and uh and i'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally backfires<n>no i don't think so you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3142-ms98-a-trans.txt
so yeah that that is really one of our it's almost a hobby with us<n>well i think that it's just that's exactly  sometimes i think going out to eat it's it's sort of a recreation<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3142-ms98-a-trans.txt
how about you<n>yeah well i live outside of Dallas and it's kind of in a little suburb so i feel pretty safe out here but i know the murder rate is going up every year<n>yeah i uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3143-ms98-a-trans.txt
i know it they have all sorts of of rights that you know are questionable maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes<n>yeah i think so i think if they knew it was going to be really horrible wherever they were going maybe they'd think twice about doing it<n>that's true maybe the punishment should be more severe<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3143-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's the other thing uh is<n>it's hard to even i can't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be especially if you're an inner city you know you can't really feel like you're putting much of a dent in what's going on and you're putting your life on your on the line everyday<n>yeah Dallas they were saying in Dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen but they keep losing them all the time and that uh you know eventually we're going to be way short on the number we need because<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3143-ms98-a-trans.txt

from the Soviet Union so i guess they're saying well you know we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries from two ways we can either act like we're gonna be<n>pro communist or act like we're going to be pro uh<n>pro democracy and whatever gets us the most out of it that's what we'll act like we're going to do but we really won't change in the long run i think that's the way i sort of see them all working you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3282-ms98-a-trans.txt

that's right<n>and so many of those kind of people uh they got they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway so you know unless they really make it rough on them that's not a going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think<n>especially not a federal prison<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3283-ms98-a-trans.txt
if if you don't have the punishment<n>you double your crime and that you know that is just personal feeling it's not going on facts<n>i think the facts would probably back it up but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3283-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh two wrongs don't make a right<n>i think its going to be very interesting because its uh<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3765-ms98-a-trans.txt
i think you need to get tough with them and quit calling them i don't think they need air conditioned cells and color TV sets they need to be put on hard labor manual<n>and as tough as you can make it no coddling no kissing their and nothing nothing just say hey you committed a wrong and you're going to serve some hard hard time<n>well there are a lot of people who think that that works pretty well and it'll be interesting to see what uh what we go to because it's uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3765-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah oh yeah it's well known and and it's consistent with what you're talking about in terms of the uh approach to uh the uh you know the people once they get through the trials and i guess<n>you know we're going to see more and more of this kind of thing i think the jury trial system<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3765-ms98-a-trans.txt
um that the well there was a guy who won in Pennsylvania uh this Senator Harris Wafford who said you know and and in this country everybody's entitled to a lawyer but not everybody's entitled to a doctor and we must spend<n>i don't know what the figure is but jury trials are are just so expensive very very expensive and time consuming and uh so i think that that all of the these things that we're talking about are going to contribute to change and i don't know uh<n>terribly expensive yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3765-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i wish i could get my weight down i need to get out and get some exercise uh  as i say i've just retired so i'm just starting to have a few days to uh approach that subject and i'm<n>considering it i'm going to get on that bicycle that we have and uh start doing some riding and i'm sure that's going to be the quickest way to get things under control<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3767-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i have uh i was talking with some with with a friend of mine not too damned long ago and i'll tell you it it's you know i don't expect this would ever happen in the United States but i'm almost of the opinion<n>that the only way that a change is going to come about is if uh we really put some teeth into the law and and make it such that uh the punishment fits the crime and uh<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3771-ms98-a-trans.txt
and a lot of um i guess um discrimination is still around and<n>i i suppose until somehow or another we can straighten out all of those things people are just going to take an extreme  uh measure and um uh protect themselves in one way or the other<n>yeah i've i'm i'm a firm believer though that uh  our justice system has has no teeth any longer that the idea of getting a sentence<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3771-ms98-a-trans.txt
but i guess i take a lot of  um little bit of um<n>safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are like drug related or  um things that places usually that i wouldn't be going  and things i usually wouldn't be involved in<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3774-ms98-a-trans.txt

um-hum<n>like one eight hundred capitol or something like that you know you just a number you could call from anywhere anytime i think that's coming and i think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change until then<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3805-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>of it going on that it would really you know uh set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture<n>well you may be right  what i think is really gonna be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it and i and i think it is what you say it's it's a<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3805-ms98-a-trans.txt
seems fair certainly if people are prepared for the fact that<n>there's a chance they're going to be tested you think they'd be smart enough if they did have a problem to eliminate their use<n>yeah well it's<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3808-ms98-a-trans.txt
you bet that's sort of neat<n>so that that's a i think that's a change and i think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing<n>sure i think uh it's the age age old thing every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on TV or something where the discussion comes out that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3809-ms98-a-trans.txt
so they certainly uh they certainly deserve it all the way<n>but i guess just the most significant thing change for me again as i mentioned it was just in traveling you see uh more and more ladies all ages with briefcases and uh and in their business suits and and going<n>and going yeah um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3809-ms98-a-trans.txt

um-hum<n>and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends so it's a good experience i think if it's good i think it's very good for the child<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3811-ms98-a-trans.txt

a year a year ago now when the the war Desert Storm was finishing up seems like things were uh<n>going to settle down and nothing seems to of seems to have settled down after all<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4030-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i i i i have very much doubt that<n>that there's a real understanding at the top levels of of the of the cultures and of what's going on<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4030-ms98-a-trans.txt
which will suck up your money real quick<n>yeah yeah it really will so we're you know we're going to have to really take a hard look at our uh expenses and things like that and uh<n>you know really make the dollars uh go a little bit further if we can and we uh had not been paying very much for housing uh since we moved to Dallas in July<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4031-ms98-a-trans.txt

i read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful<n>i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's going on<n>that's true i mean my roommates and stuff you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>talking with people and just hearing what's going on but<n>do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like the McNeil Lehrer Hour<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt
i think i think the uh<n>i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but um it seems that um<n>they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt
they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news<n>right and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not and basically you know if a candidate candidate can get them to follow then the news will<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah exactly<n>i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on<n>uh-huh uh because they can they can only report on i mean they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and you know and and your catastrophes catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really don't know what's going on<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt

it you know and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information<n>what kind of uh see i subscribe to like Science News and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about<n>right i<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the war when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on but a lot of the times<n>oh yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt
but<n>well i remember during back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the TV on because that they were going constantly with that stuff<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information<n>if they reported every murder if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour but uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4033-ms98-a-trans.txt

but yeah Doonesbury is great i mean<n>sometimes he that doesn't even try to be funny he just puts stuff in that strip that we're not going to see anywhere else<n>and uh uh like when he was quoting an entire week from Bush's speeches and the guy was completely incoherent<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4232-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>if you assume they're biased and then look for some opposite biases you get a fairly good idea of what's going on<n>i know and it's like especially like if with the network news they always comment about everything and their comments are always biased<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4232-ms98-a-trans.txt
um<n>campaign things that have been going on<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4232-ms98-a-trans.txt

about three dollars and um twenty cents or so or something like that i i was about half asleep when they were talking about it on the news but um<n>it is not going to go over too well as long as you have to pay a premium to participate i don't believe<n>yeah unless they structure the garbage rates so that uh you know it like works out to be cheaper<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4233-ms98-a-trans.txt
and<n>yeah and then uh the other thing is what do they do with all the stuff they're just they're going to recycle they now have this huge glut of paper<n>um and it's difficult to find markets for it so the as a result the um price of<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4233-ms98-a-trans.txt

that's right<n>so they're going to tell you what sells and also although i don't believe this is really that rampant at now uh you know sponsors or or advertisers could have some influence as well over over what uh eventually gets printed<n>i uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4235-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i think that's<n>uh it's kind of related to like who writes history because obviously the the news eventually does become history it's just always going to be someone's the prevailing opinion<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4235-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh but i'm very you know i you know i've gotten<n>it's i i it's funny how you get older and you don't know what's going on in popular music at all like who are some of the heavy metal<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4236-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah it's it<n>preach that as as a political statement you know in front of congress saying we should fund it because we don't know what we're going to discover<n>yeah that's kind of that's kind of hard to defend in some ways but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4246-ms98-a-trans.txt

there there there needs to be lots of evidence for appealing um<n>i have a friend who uh took his trial by judge and that's the worst mistake anyone can ever make because at least with the jury even though you're going to be tried by six or twelve people who weren't able to get out of jury duty<n>that's an old joke but it's still true a lot of the people who you would want to have on your jury don't want to have anything to do with it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4294-ms98-a-trans.txt
but still i take my chance with the odds of twelve<n>and we have to sacrifice letting a few people get away with things because eventually they're going to be caught then<n>for my personal risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4294-ms98-a-trans.txt
not at this point in the business cycle you can't<n>yeah i think that the people that um orchestrated this and engineered our having the deficit should have appreciated you know what it was ultimately going to cost it was a very bad decision to start letting that grow<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4295-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh that's you know that's one step and it what it is what they're getting into is the drug testing is a real quick and easy way and politically<n>um feasible way of going about this because you know everybody is going to be against drugs you know well just about everybody is against drug use so let's test everybody for it<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4302-ms98-a-trans.txt
wow<n>you know and so it's obviously that there's not you could've decided okay i'm going to stop now and may have stopped for three months and still it would show up in these tests and that's completely unfair<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4302-ms98-a-trans.txt

kind of what<n>kind of overused in a sense it's the idea is that you can have a two income family and nothing is going to be changed you know the idea of quality time over<n>over quantity of time spent with kids which i think is nonsense<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4304-ms98-a-trans.txt

and further more if we think that you are<n>uh we're going to make sure that you can't get a job or that you'll be fired from your job if you are engaging in this behavior<n>now blood tests aren't really being called for what they're doing is calling for piss tests which technically it's leaving your body but whatever it is they shouldn't even have the right to ask<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4307-ms98-a-trans.txt

that that's another way is that the consumers just don't trust big business they just don't there's<n>so right there you have an element of of the political government you have an element of big business and you have the consumer watching and they're just going what's this<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4310-ms98-a-trans.txt
the in the our capitalistic society it's just those controls it's just it's<n>the business it starts going and if they can its its the dollar that that dictates and if they can find someplace to dump something or their pollution and we're polluting something unfortunately<n>well<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4310-ms98-a-trans.txt
and um  it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose  the child care facilities<n>well i guess if i were going to choose i mean my first consideration would be safety<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4311-ms98-a-trans.txt

i think it's important that it happened i think that ultimately it will happen<n>um i think that the way things are going on now may be an impediment and that by that i mean<n>you know i don't know about i'm not going to speculate about research across the board but let's suppose um you were the executive of a company that could possibly have benefit from some space research<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4313-ms98-a-trans.txt

right it's uh it's you you it's the same it's the same premise as day care for a child<n>yeah you know it really is you know that brings up a good point i've got a friend of mine up here and we were talking about this because his father is getting to the age where they're going to have to decide what to do and<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4522-ms98-a-trans.txt
our schools are reflecting the same kind of mismanagement that uh lead to the demise of the Soviet Union and that is when you've got an absolute monopoly<n>and uh you can't uh you know it's a one party system so to speak then what you're going to have is gross inefficiencies and nobody cares<n>and reality uh uh is just not a market base system and i know i've been in the Orient for about three years and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4526-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and if somebody decides that they're going to if their decisions are out of step with reality uh pretty soon people don't stop going there<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4526-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and i you know i'm a i the only that i hate is uh well along with that training is i when kids have accidents with guns i there's a lot of stuff coming out now that they're going to start holding the parents responsible for not<n>making the gun safe and i think there's a lot to that because kids are just naturally curious and then and you know when they're five and six years old accidents will happen that's why you know they need to be locked up the ammunition kept separate and all kinds of stuff<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4540-ms98-a-trans.txt

and and handguns are just fine and i just think you know there's some middle ground there to where<n>that they maybe go overboard and do too much they i guess they do have a lot of lobbying power power and you know their big thing is well if you you stop banning one type then it's going to lead to the next and so on and<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4540-ms98-a-trans.txt

you start way back when<n>yeah generally you know a kid'll do something that's outrageous and they'll say well what are you going to do to me and it's almost like the criminal system<n>there's not much i can do to them i can't really do anything to them one fellow said i said how about you do your work and he said well how about i throw these scissors at you<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and and i think that's the the biggest thing that unless people know that you're serious and you're not gonna tolerate that kind of behavior in anybody i this is just gonna keep going<n>um-hum well i think that's like the problem with you know drunk drivers that people don't they're not cracking down they let them back out on the street they don't really take away their license they don't really make sure they can't drive anymore<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt

okay well um<n>i've never i've didn't really ever have to have a budget um until i quit going to Georgia Tech and um then i learned to budget really fast  um<n>i had been working part-time before that and uh my parents were helping me some but um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt
i had been working part-time before that and uh my parents were helping me some but um<n>i got to where i mean i knew where every penny was going but then as i started making more money um<n>my budget's kind of hasn't doesn't exist except for at certain times  you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt
i still haven't managed to uh uh do it the way i should<n>yeah but even even if you do break your budget i think when you write things down or however if if you do it on the computer whatever or something where you can just constantly see exactly what where your money's going<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt
but<n>but even if you can't i don't think have enough a really when before when i had a strict budget it's because i had too i knew exactly where every penny was going before i had it but<n>it's it's a little bit harder when you have a little bit more leeway<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>but you'll find that the  kids don't really have a very good sense of where the money is going and so they'll ask for things pretty much constantly<n>right i remember doing that as a child<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt
but uh i don't know whether i believe that they should just randomly do it<n>i think they should kind of warn them like you know well we're going to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired<n>you know that this is what's gonna happen<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4605-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i think so<n>i think they all should test really you know uh it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4605-ms98-a-trans.txt

right of course motivation is everything and i suppose you're striving for intimacy on a intellectual level<n>it's really hard to figure out how you're going to do that but of course we're trying to talk about dress and not teaching<n>well i i think i'm talking about dressing how it conveys a uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4612-ms98-a-trans.txt
and the old uh if you can't see it then you can't spend it uh idea<n>exactly exactly and if you can't touch it you can't spend it either so that kind of works out where you get into uh some plans that you know you touch it you're going to get a penalty that kind of thing so<n>it leads you to kind of say well i'm not going to take it out i'm going to keep it and uh keep it in there and let it grow so that some way<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4615-ms98-a-trans.txt
exactly exactly and if you can't touch it you can't spend it either so that kind of works out where you get into uh some plans that you know you touch it you're going to get a penalty that kind of thing so<n>it leads you to kind of say well i'm not going to take it out i'm going to keep it and uh keep it in there and let it grow so that some way<n>maybe for retirement you're going to have that money  left let's hope anyway so you'll have that so<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4615-ms98-a-trans.txt

not very often<n>but but i'm just i'm just saying as a single person that's that's a drop in the bucket and so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up if you're buying mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which i don't care to go to<n>that's right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4626-ms98-a-trans.txt
the uh better chance you have at at curing it and that's just not true<n>no i don't think so i  i i totally agree it's just like education throwing more money into a grade school isn't necessarily going to make things better<n>right i think uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4629-ms98-a-trans.txt

like out of nowhere yeah<n>yeah i think mainly because i haven't been watching what's politically going on um in that at you know<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4814-ms98-a-trans.txt
but um as far as politics in the grander uh<n>part of it as if you want to look at uh election type things i'm not quite sure even if i'm going to vote uh<n>um-hum yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4814-ms98-a-trans.txt

unfortunately having her come live with us you know if she needs constant care is not going to be an option and what do you do you know<n>yeah it's it's a real problem um it is a real problem and i know that everybody hates the idea of going to one of these but i also think that<n>it is a choice that we have all made in our lives as we have drawn back and internalized ourselves as opposed to being a part of the community<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4815-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's a big job you know uh<n>so many needs are crying the homeless the abused children the the beaten wives you know there's so many things going on that that how do we all of this<n>and maybe that's a part of it maybe maybe what we can do is uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4815-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>uh i think my car needs are going to change i had very small children and i was saddled with a station wagon that i never wanted<n>oh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4818-ms98-a-trans.txt
if it turns out that a better price is from say Japan like the Subarus then i i would go for that because the most important thing is price i mean because<n>well you know the more i think of it  you know with what's going on in the world nowadays i think the next car i would try to buy an American one<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4818-ms98-a-trans.txt

um<n>i'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world rather than simply being aware that<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4821-ms98-a-trans.txt
okay go ahead<n>well uh a friend of mine actually works for McDonald Douglas in the uh in the space station program so i get to find out a lot of information about what's going on there and it sure sounds like<n>oh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4822-ms98-a-trans.txt
sure<n>that's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4822-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>um they're they're going to be doing a lot of interesting things um i think one of the the big things that he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads<n>and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4822-ms98-a-trans.txt
well that's good<n>because sometimes i wonder you know being a uh lay person out there of not uh knowing exactly exactly what's going on in space<n>whether you know they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here being you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4822-ms98-a-trans.txt
because sometimes i wonder you know being a uh lay person out there of not uh knowing exactly exactly what's going on in space<n>whether you know they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here being you know<n>to me the all this uh space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4822-ms98-a-trans.txt
to me i would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here<n>and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space and what it you know not that i want everything to halt and<n>let's forget about the space program or whatever because we're always curious and we always need to know more things but um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4822-ms98-a-trans.txt
let's forget about the space program or whatever because we're always curious and we always need to know more things but um<n>it to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here<n>mainly because uh the space program has taught us that there is no other place for  us i mean this is it i mean if we would've<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4822-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>um unless technology makes the decision that we all are going to live in space or whatever but<n>i would love to um go into the space shuttle some day and uh just see um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4822-ms98-a-trans.txt

right<n>so i wonder how you know somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun<n>you know in the aspect that we see it uh and never seeing uh you know light bright days you know and uh breathing<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4822-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>that you  didn't own in the first place there's you know going to be problems i mean that's basically what's happened i mean<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4823-ms98-a-trans.txt
and you know it's not the way to go about any kind of uh<n>solution that's ever going to be workable you know i mean you neither party was consulted up front<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4823-ms98-a-trans.txt
and you can't argue with them on any sort of logical or emotional basis<n>a fanatic will believe in X Y Z and you're never going to change that<n>yeah i i suspect<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4823-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>that probably the biggest problems we're going to have in foreign policy are going to have Middle East in the future<n>i think that we're going to continue to see a lot more fundamentalist influence in the area it's been spawning for a long time<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4823-ms98-a-trans.txt
that probably the biggest problems we're going to have in foreign policy are going to have Middle East in the future<n>i think that we're going to continue to see a lot more fundamentalist influence in the area it's been spawning for a long time<n>the more moderate states uh even including Saudi Arabia which is a very religious country Islamic wise it's not allowed the fundamentalist to gain control<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4823-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>the more nations that join with this kind of uh thinking in government the more stronger uh difficulty we're going to have<n>as a nation in dealing with the region because of our past experiences with the Palestinians<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4823-ms98-a-trans.txt

so i'm i'm pretty pleased about that the thing is it only cost about a hundred dollars which for a leather jacket is quite reasonable<n>but the repair i was going to just bring it in and have it repair the repair would've been about seventy<n>and i was going to i was just going to do it i hated to throw it out<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4825-ms98-a-trans.txt
but the repair i was going to just bring it in and have it repair the repair would've been about seventy<n>and i was going to i was just going to do it i hated to throw it out<n>so i i think if you make enough noise you can get your problems taken care of in most cases<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4825-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i called up the repair shop apparently this some kind of uh box in the uh Ford car that just dies and they know it dies<n>and in every car you're going to have that's a Ford car it's going to die and i guess after so many miles<n>and he told me over the phone before he even saw that's probably what it was<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4825-ms98-a-trans.txt

well i i feel the other thing too uh they were saying uh you know what new ways could you could it you you know change the system<n>i i really think that um we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal i mean if if you go to a trial by jury<n>and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime there's uh no question it's beyond a reasonable doubt<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4830-ms98-a-trans.txt
see when when when you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times uh you know the benefits are good and and you know the pay's regular<n>but uh well you know sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on and i i i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that uh anybody could get in uh in dealing in a with a large company<n>is to be in a situation where you you get to know what's going on and maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4831-ms98-a-trans.txt
but uh well you know sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on and i i i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that uh anybody could get in uh in dealing in a with a large company<n>is to be in a situation where you you get to know what's going on and maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do<n>what's what's your feeling about benefits what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4831-ms98-a-trans.txt

i mean i feel like if i i don't necessarily need to uh be involved since i'm pretty much on a low level you are you are right there you know i'm pretty much on a low level as far as uh<n>uh the company is concerned but i i do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening and i think i can be a better and more effective employee if if i had a little bit more information along that line<n>well that i<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4831-ms98-a-trans.txt
but uh but uh our organization is doing something else tomorrow on Monday uh we're having a for all unclassified programs we're we're having little tables put out in front of you know lab in the hallways<n>and everybody all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do<n>which i thought was kind of interesting<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4831-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah that is interesting<n>but uh but that sort sort of thing but but if but just i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on<n>exactly<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4831-ms98-a-trans.txt

but like you said we were not shown that we were not uh unless we you know read in-depth you you get that you don't get that impression and so that makes everybody up in arms<n>i've been very annoyed lately by the sensationalism that's going on<n>i was uh visiting some friends over the Easter vacation in California in uh California near San Francisco<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4879-ms98-a-trans.txt

um i have a very good idea of what our expenses are and how much we can afford to spend and can't spend and<n>you know so it it's not like we just totally don't have a clue as to what's going on but i wish we were a little more organized a little more<n>you know when i think about it there are certain parameters we work about<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4891-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's right that's right<n>you know you never know if if you own a home you never know if something's going to break and you're gonna need more<n>that's right well it's very difficult my husband is in is self-employed he's in uh financial planning and and so all of his income is commissions<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4891-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's right well it's very difficult my husband is in is self-employed he's in uh financial planning and and so all of his income is commissions<n>it's very hard to sit down and budget because you don't know what he's going to make uh you know we kind of think you know he usually brings home at least this much and i can base you know base it from there<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4891-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh i guess it's not totally<n>not understandable  you know i'm i'm sure that if you're looking at whether or not you're going to get elected and have enough money to run that they've got to uh got to take that into consideration<n>oh sure but i think it goes i you know a little of it obviously is they're getting themselves prepared for when they're out of office when they become consultants or high-powered lobbyists themselves<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4895-ms98-a-trans.txt
it's uh well it it's it's such a complicated thing let me just relate to you uh<n>an experience that i had with politics at a lower level uh and i think what it boils down to is that if you can't find compromise you're not going to be successful<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4895-ms98-a-trans.txt
so i guess if we were to go about making the change<n>you would have to really demonstrate to people that there is some legitimate reason to make the change that would directly benefit them otherwise we're never going to really see any change<n>yeah well<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4899-ms98-a-trans.txt

who i don't think are going to especially you know they may do it in the more in the big city centers or in certain round uh manufacturing industries<n>but the average person in Raleigh Missouri i don't think is going to what was this celsius stuff you know i don't<n>well it it happens first well it i guess it happens first in either of the two places i guess either in the school or just products<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4899-ms98-a-trans.txt

i substitute teach and i have kids who talk fresh don't do homework and they say so what's going to happen to me and<n>and people getting less and less respect and they understand they know that the bottom line is not very much is going to happen to them<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4901-ms98-a-trans.txt
are always willing to um let in cheap labor  if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area<n>those are two  things that i think are going on although they i i i don't think the politicians would tell you that<n>okay and i think you're right in both cases<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4902-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and uh i think it's too early to say you know whether they're going to develop some stable societies there in one form or another<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4903-ms98-a-trans.txt
or whether this uh  old uh Russian tendency to<n>turn their fate over to some insane ruler is going to surface again<n>sure yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4903-ms98-a-trans.txt
um<n>it's going to take both democracy and economic progress and uh resolution of their nationalist institutes i guess<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4903-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>all of that is going to have to happen and if any one of them turn sour they could still be uh dangerous simply because they might not<n>you know they just might sort of lose track of what they're doing<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4903-ms98-a-trans.txt
it looks like um<n>we're going to have um a um<n>sort of a third party movement on our hands in the fall<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i  that's a pretty good point i hadn't thought about it like that but yeah it's i guess it's not really um a start up with uh<n>necessarily new ideas and you know this is my positive outlook but rather uh saying well uh i'm just not very happy with uh with the other two parties seem to be going type of thing<n>yeah i think there's absolutely no political philosophy the only thing that uh Perot um seems to has to offer is that uh he's a doer<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and since most people agree on what needs to be done but nobody can figure out how to do it he's just going to say uh<n>i'm a CEO i know how to tell people to do things and get them done<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt
um<n>in each party and not really coming up with a new ideas or the or maybe i mean it it you know it's time for maybe a definite new vision and and what's going on which may be you know a blend of both<n>you know maybe both parties or you know a little bit of this a little bit of that which may not fall into the lines of either party but you know just doesn't seem as though either party wants to do very much that rocks the boat or maybe maybe says oh its time for a little bit of you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>things aren't going very well oh in the big picture maybe right now Congress getting better or it's maybe it's getting worse or who knows but you know it's just like a little ripple in the ocean it's  know some some somebody got to look down the road a ways and say well what's going to go on<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4909-ms98-a-trans.txt
i i think it has to be up front and then you've got the choice of not doing it<n>yeah well well the problem there is that you know a lot of people that have worked for the same company for so long um that company decides well if we're going to hire new people you know<n>well we're going to have to start checking it because we've had a problem in the past<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4911-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah well well the problem there is that you know a lot of people that have worked for the same company for so long um that company decides well if we're going to hire new people you know<n>well we're going to have to start checking it because we've had a problem in the past<n>well their problem in the past is with past employees and so the new people are saying well<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4911-ms98-a-trans.txt
um and uh<n>then they have the choice of either take the test or don't get the or or don't take the job and if they know they're going to fail the test you know<n>they're kind of in a in a between a rock and a hard place there so it's uh kind of like<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4911-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know a little crazy<n>but he wouldn't you know give a urine sample and it was pretty obvious why you know he's just like oh i can't do it i can't do it you know  and this went on for hours i was wondering why he didn't just leave you know if you're not going to do it just leave<n>he was gonna fail<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4911-ms98-a-trans.txt
yep yep<n>and then here's what we have now i mean what's in five years from now it's just unimaginable what we're going to be able to do with these things<n>yeah yeah well you know if we ever get any sort of uh ISDN running nationally it'll be really incredible<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>uh so you know it's going to kind of impact everybody everywhere<n>well i see the phone companies are working on getting into information services so we're going to have a glut of things everyone i think we're going to see another revolution in<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh so you know it's going to kind of impact everybody everywhere<n>well i see the phone companies are working on getting into information services so we're going to have a glut of things everyone i think we're going to see another revolution in<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum oh yeah<n>and i think that the technology's catching up to the point where we're going to be able to do things and make it a lot easier to for people to understand how to do these things<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt
so i'm hoping that we will see another type of revolution but one that will be a little more friendly to the end user<n>yeah yeah um i think what's going to happen is it's going to sneak into the consumer market uh through the television and through the cable industry and telephone industry<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>but i think everyone's working now i i mean i'm seeing this we're going to see a lot more in the way of keyboards with electronic program guides and and everything else and ordering systems they have this thing called TV<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4914-ms98-a-trans.txt

i you know i'm concerned more concerned about Democrats saying they're unhappy with Bill Clinton and then they go and vote for Ross Perot and then we basically split any protest vote<n>against against Bush more or less in half you know i mean you're dividing it too far and then he squeaks by for four more years and you know for me that's not a going to be a wonderful uh feeling<n>exactly<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4926-ms98-a-trans.txt
