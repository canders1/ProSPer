According to the tragic legend, there once was a woman who was abandoned by her husband, or lover, and left with two or three children. Angry and seeking revenge, she kills her children by throwing them into a river, or sometimes by other means. When she realizes what she’s done, she goes insane. She is condemned to spend eternity searching for her lost and dead children. Consequently she is often heard in the night calling her children. She frequents rivers and other bodies of water, and is sometimes seen floating above the water looking, searching for her children. Her legend has been recited for over 300 years, and in contemporary times she is still believed to be wandering the streets in large cities, as well as in the small towns of the Southwest where numerous people report encounters with her. At times she is seen as a beautiful woman, wearing a white dress, roaming back streets and country roads, crying and weeping. Sometimes she becomes visible to the wayward husband who is out late, drinking, and when he approaches her, she turns into an ugly horse-faced hag, scaring him into swearing abstinence forever. Parents use her name to scare little children into obedience: “Hay viene La Llorona . . . portaté bien” (The Llorona is coming, behave yourself). Even adults who’ve heard the story many times and do not want to admit belief still fear a late-night encounter with La Llorona.<n>There are ancient texts of indigenous mythology narrated by the Aztecs and recorded by the Spaniards that very closely resemble the La Llorona legend. In some tales she is believed to be Cihuacoatl, the patron goddess of women who die in childbirth. It is said that Cihuacoatl carried a little baby cradle on her back, or a dead baby in her arms, as she roamed the country crying through the nights. Those who saw her considered it an ill omen. Sahagún mentions in The Conquest of Mexico that “a woman was often heard [as] she went weeping and crying out. Loudly did she call out at night. She walked about saying: ‘O my beloved sons, now we are about to go!’” (Horcasitas and Butterworth, 208). Horcasitas and Butterworth reprint several texts of these early chronicles. Diego Muñoz Camargo (ca. 1529–1599) also reported that before the Spaniards arrived, “many times and many nights was heard the voice of a woman who cried out in a loud voice, drowning herself with her tears, and with great sobs and sighs, wailing” (Horcasitas and Butterworth, 209).<n>Contemporary texts of La Llorona collected in Mexico assert that the original Llorona was La Malinche, the mistress of Cortés. Cortés abandoned her to return to Spain, and according to the legend Malinche killed their son with a knife. This could be the source of another characteristic of the La Llorona legend. In many variants the reason for her abandonment by her lover is their class differences. He leaves her for someone of his own class, or she is an Indian woman or a mestiza (mixed-race woman) and he is of pure blood. In other variants, she is a woman of the streets, who doesn’t want her illegitimate children, so she throws them into the river. She is always described as having long hair, down below her waist, and is seen wearing a white gown. Sometimes men see her as a temptress and a siren; she entices them to follow her, and then she frightens them with her horrible looks. They are usually found dead the next day. What appears to be an unjust punishment is that La Llorona is condemned to wander for eternity, crying and repenting, searching for her lost children. All mothers who have lost children identify with her, and feel her pain.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
La Virgen de Guadalupe<n>Also commonly known as Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, she is the Virgin Mary who appeared to Juan Diego, a Mexican Christian Indian, on December 9, 1531. Historical documents verify the story of her apparitions. She identified herself as the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, and speaking in Nahuatl, she asked Juan Diego to go to the Spanish bishop and ask that a temple be built there where she appeared, the mount of Tepeyac. To Juan Diego she was a beautiful woman who spoke his language, so after much difficulty he sought to speak to the bishop, but his story was not heard, and he was asked to return another day. The beautiful woman appeared to Juan Diego a second time, and he was asked to seek the bishop’s audience again. On the second try Juan Diego saw the bishop, his story was heard and questioned, but was not believed. The bishop wanted a sign from the Great Lady so that he would know it was really she who was sending Juan Diego. Diego intended to go back to Tepeyac and inform the beautiful woman, but when he returned home he found that his uncle Juan Bernardino was extremely ill. The next morning, on December 12, as he walked to Tlatelolco to call a priest to come to his uncle’s side, the beautiful woman came to him a third time asking what was wrong. Diego told her of his sick uncle and of the request from the bishop. She told him his uncle was now well and would not die and sent him to the top of a hill to cut fresh flowers that he was to take to the bishop as proof of her existence. Diego followed her instructions and at the top of the hill he found beautiful roses of Castile, still covered with dew. He cut them and The Lady, the Mother of God, arranged them in his tilma (cloak) and sent him to the bishop, with the proof requested. When Diego unfolded his tilma in front of the bishop, the roses fell to the floor, and there on the tilma was an image of the Virgin Mary. Now the Spanish bishop believed, and as the beautiful woman requested, a church was built right on the mount of Tepeyac. The tilma with the image of the Virgin Mary still hangs in the temple called Guadalupe. The name that the beautiful Lady gave herself was Tlecuauhtlacupeuh, but to the Spaniards it sounded like Guadalupe, which they instantly recognized as “Our Lady of Guadalupe” from Estremadura, Spain. But the Aztecs understood that in the Nahuatl language the name Tlecuauhtlacupeuh meant “la que viene volando de la luz como el águila de fuego” (she who comes flying from the region of light like an eagle of fire).<n>Tonantzin was an Aztec goddess, literally called Our Holy Mother, also known as Tonan. Guadalupe appeared at what was once the temple of Tonantzin at the mount of Tepeyac. Even today in Mexico, La Virgen María is often called Tonantzin. The acceptance of La Virgen de Guadalupe by the indigenous population of Mexico was the beginning of Mexican Christianity and the conversion of the Aztecs to Catholicism. Guadalupe became the symbol of Indian Catholicism, different from the European Catholicism of the Spaniards. As the Aztecs adapted the Catholic religion to their indigenous beliefs, they created a religion that met their own needs and own way of life. She was declared the “Patroness of the Mexican Nation” in 1737, and in 1754 Pope Benedict XIV canonized Guadalupe as an official saint. She was crowned “Queen of Mexico” in 1895, showing how strong a symbol of Mexican nationalism she had become. Today she continues as the country’s strongest symbol of Mexican identity. The cathedral built in her honor can no longer be used because of structural damage, but a new one was built in the early 1970s. Masses are held every hour of the day and the church is constantly filled to capacity.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chV.txt
A number of years ago I accompanied the architect Jack Diamond on a visit to a building that he had just completed at York University in Toronto. It was a student center, containing a food court and lounges on the main level and student organization offices on the second floor. The exterior of the building was decidedly traditional. Facing a landscaped common, the well-proportioned façade consisted of a colonnaded brick base supporting a row of double columns capped by a deep copper-lined cornice. Behind the colonnade, which was fitted with retractable glass panels that could be opened during warm weather, was a two-story-high hall lit by three large skylights. The exterior had a simplicity that reminded me of McKim, Mead & White, albeit without Classical ornament.<n>The interior was different, with many hallmarks of the International Style: no decoration, bare concrete, exposed structural beams, factory sash glazing and steel pipe railings. I assumed that the stark simplicity was the result of a restricted budget, and a desire to use materials that would withstand wear and tear. It seemed pretty banal to me, and although I didn’t say anything to Jack, I was disappointed. Yet as we walked around, I changed my mind. Although the décor was tough and unsentimental, it was not crude. There were sleek stainless-steel pendant lighting fixtures with suspended glass diffusers and stylish easy chairs covered in canvas. In the food court, the bar and counter tops were marble, the dining tables solid maple. Students were gathered around tables, lounging on the staircase, sprawled on the floor. The atmosphere was hard to pin down. This was not the precious, corporate modernism of Richard Meier, nor the contrived, technological wizardry of Norman Foster. It was certainly not the Calvinist minimalism that I associated with many trendy younger architects. I couldn’t put my finger on it until I realized that the functional but chic décor reminded me of the no-nonsense styling of a Benetton clothing store.<n>I happen to like Collegiate Gothic buildings. I like their dark rooms with wood paneling, hammer-beam ceilings, and traditional oak furniture. But seeing the York student center made me realize that whenever I walk through these old buildings I also experience a nagging dissatisfaction. It has to do with the students. The young men and women in baseball caps, shorts, stenciled sweat shirts, and iridescent nylon windbreakers just don’t fit in. They should be wearing boaters and blazers, tweeds and flannels. Of course, no student that I have ever seen—including at Oxford—dresses that way. I may deplore the loss of decorum, but as an architect I can’t do anything to change it. It is the building that must do the accommodating.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch1.txt

Badaling is crowded, especially from June through September, but it is quite beautiful. Equally attractive is the second-most visited section of the Great Wall at Mutianyu, 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Beijing. Mutianyu was opened to tourists in 1986 to relieve the crowding at Badaling. There is also a cable car at Mutianyu, eliminating the 20-minute hike up to the wall, and at the foot of the wall there is again a village of vendors, shops, and cafés. Mutianyu is one of the oldest restored sections of the Great Wall in the Beijing area, thought to have been built under the Ming rulers nearly 500 years ago. Visitors can walk well over a kilometer (nearly a mile) atop these ramparts from watchtower to watchtower. At either end you can view the crumbling wall running to the horizon, broken but still visible. In the early spring and late fall, particularly on weekdays, the Great Wall at Mutianya is not very crowded. Surrounded by its renowned green forests, it is a pleasant alternative to Badaling.<n>The Great Wall at Juyongguan, 58 km (36 miles) northwest of Beijing on the way to the Badaling section, is the newest portion of the wall open to tourism (1998) and the nearest to the capital. Juyongguan contains a massive guard tower marking one of the Great Wall’s most celebrated mountain passes. This guard tower, built in 1345, is decorated in Buddhist carvings, with inscriptions in Chinese, Tibetan, Sanskrit, and languages of the northern tribes. Some of the temples and parks clustered at the pass in the days of the Ming dynasty have also been restored here. The wall can be walked for 4 km (21⁄2 miles) as it winds over the peaks of the Taihang Mountains.<n>The least restored, least crowded major segment of the Great Wall near Beijing is at Simatai, 124 km (77 miles) northeast of the capital. Not only is Simatai rather far from the capital, it is also quite uncrowded and unreconstructed. Its stairways and watchtowers resemble those crumbling edifices one can only glimpse from Badaling, Mutianyu, and Juyongguan. The natural scenery is dramatic, and the ruined state of the wall gives Simatai a romantic feel (although there is a cable car to the top). It is also dangerous, with broken stairways leading up some of the 70-degree inclines. Other portions are in such ruins that one must walk along the outside of the wall on steep, narrow paths, where the footing is difficult.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt
Vidám Park, next door, is an old-fashioned, funfair-style amusement park for the kids. You won’t ﬁnd American-style thrill rides here, just carousels, dodgem cars, a ferris wheel, and a few other low-technology sources of fun. A mini-version of the park more suited for younger children adjoins it. Next door to the amusement parks, a circus makes regular appearances throughout the year. For dates consult Programme magazine (see page 118).<n>If you want to return to downtown Pest, but feel you have walked enough for one day, take the Millenium line metro, which runs the whole length of Andrássy út (look for the antique yellow “Földalatti” signs). The quaint old-fashioned trains are a tourist attraction in their own right. Note that the trains run in the same direction as trafﬁc, and you must descend to the platform from the appropriate side of the road; it is not possible to cross the lines once you are underground.<n>The Great Boulevard<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
The Blackfoot<n>Our popular image of the North American Indian is conditioned by Hollywood’s stereotype — feather headdress, necklace of scalps, and whooping war dances around the campfire — which in fact derived from the prairie tribes, or Plains Indians, as they are known to American anthropologists. The Blackfoot of Alberta are a classic example. Their name, says the myth, was bestowed on them when an ancestor, on his way to meet another tribe, walked through land burned by prairie fire and blackened his moccasins.<n>For these great hunters of the Rocky Mountain foothills and prairies, wild game included grizzly and black bear, antelope, deer, elk, wild sheep, and goats, but the only “real meat” was buffalo. Before the early 1700s, when horses appeared on the scene, guile was more important than speed, and hunters stalked the buffalo herd disguised with the skins of wolf and buffalo calves. Horseback hunting brought new skills and prestige to an élite that had been given no other duties. The Blackfoot went to war with Shoshoni and Crow Indians, to the south, for their horses, and were in turn attacked by the Cree from the north for their territory’s great buffalo herds. Buffalo was everything to these tribes — food, clothes, and tents; and twelve to fourteen buffalo skins were needed to construct a single teepee. So the cultural and ecological shock was all the greater when the herds were exterminated in the 1870s. Métis and Cree Indians were devastatingly efficient with their repeater rifles, and the transcontinental railway builders made a deliberate policy of clearing the tracks of migrating buffalo. By 1877, under the Canadian government’s Blackfoot Treaty, the native peoples gave up their hunting grounds to raise cattle on reserves instead.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt
