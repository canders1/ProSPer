So we take it back to my house and, uh, we are sitting there trying to bend it back and, uh, so his parents don't get mad at him that he messed up his jet ski or whatever.

[SEP] Well when I got there, uh, I just rolled in there we dropped the jet skis off, and I just jetted right out all of the sudden, you know his parents didn't even know we had got there, and, uh, my friend Eric and he asked me again, "Are you OK to drive?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And I also tend to, um, hear about authors from, you know, friends or, or hear of a famous book from a friend and I'll read one and if there happens to be a series on it then, you know, I'll start reading those. [SEP] I actually just started reading, uh, the first three books of the Harry Potter series and I think those are intended for a much younger audience, but I've actually read all, the first three that have	come	out and I've enjoyed them `cause that's basically, it's about a kid who's a magician, basically, finds out that he's a magician.

[SEP] And Dad said he had noticed, he had seen me throwing tomatoes in Mrs. Faulk's yard, so he told me that I was in trouble and I was going to get a spanking, and, um, I was kind of uh, uh looking for an out so I was smart enough to say, "Hey Dad!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

They would go, you know, just go out of the fence. [SEP] A lot of times they would get their horns and stuff caught into the, um, fences because there were square fences that my father himself put up all around the property but they would get their horns and stuff, and they would jump over the fence very easily so they would be on the side of the highway and at least 4 or 5 times that I can remember the police would have to	come	and say, you know, "You have to get your animals."

[SEP] We had the goats out there and often our animals would get loose and we had to go out and follow our cow home or something like that, or the, um, animal control would	come	out to like subdue a cow if it would get too far away so that's really the story I have today, um it was just really a awkward experience with him and his animals.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FosterDimitra.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

[SEP] Um, another time, this was for the, um, other brother, um, the one that had been sick as a baby, they bought him, one year, all this um cowboy and Indian stuff, and again all this assembly was required, and, um, the same friends that had helped put together all the boxes a few years earlier for my other brother, um, had	come	over and they had to put all these decals and stickers on everything and then had to individually dress all the different Indians, and, um cowboys and you know the tiny guns and the little itty-bitty tiny holsters that they had to put around the waist of all the different cowboys, and, uh, then, you know, all the little, um, suits and headdresses and everything that had to go on all the little Indians and the horses and the saddles and all this kind of stuff.

Um, and you look at other kinds of things and I think Charlotte, and maybe it's typical of the South, but I think that, uh, maybe there hasn't been as much growth here before and when you have growth and you have people coming in, who, looking for services.

[SEP] In fact, the town of Matthews, I think, um, at least my understanding is, is that when Providence Plantation, uh, reached a certain point in population they, they wanted to be annexed to the town of Matthews because they thought maybe that the city of Charlotte would annex them and so they wanted to, that they petitioned the town of Matthews to annex.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

[SEP] So in order to make sure that I would be there one of the Quail Girls, who lived right around the corner from the Speckmans, said she would	come	and she would pick me up. [SEP] Michaela couldn't drive me because she had to be there early to be in this program.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
She'll tell you like it is and if you don't like it then that's just too bad. [SEP] But we've	come	to realize that's her and that's just the way it's going to have to be. [SEP] But, um, um, so my next story, I guess I want to talk about, uh, I guess I'll move on to kind of high school era.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	5

I can remember four and earlier. [SEP] They	come	once in a while, but I don't really have anything real strong. [SEP] But, uh, I loved the colors and all the illustrations too, and just the zaniness.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
I loved baseball, still do, but, uh, you know, just to read about these famous people and dream about playing sports and being some kind of hero. [SEP] And, uh, every once in a while, I think my dad caught onto that, but, uh, he'd	come	down and tell me to shut the, shut the lamp off every once in a while. [SEP] But, uh, I'd usually, I just read and read and read.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	5
But, uh, those are the two best storytellers I know in our family. [SEP] I remember my dad, my dad told us he would tell us stories about his childhood but usually, usually from him that, that doesn't really	come	until later. [SEP] But, uh, when he would start telling about when he was a teenager some of the, some of the teenaged stuff he and his teenaged brothers did when they worked for their dad's business, my grandfather.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
But anyway their stories would go on and on about going one mile an hour up a hill taking forever to get somewhere driving getting up, a head up steam in the winter and Bucking snowdrifts is what they called it. [SEP] The snowdrifts would	come	out into the streets into the road and, uh, this was in rural MN, so half the time you couldn't see where the road was anyway but they would go plowing these snowdrifts, you know. [SEP] It was all fun and teenaged fun until you, until you ended up in a ditch in the middle of a blizzard.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
The biggest prejudice that we saw exercised at the schools, the children that lived out of town were called bus children, and they were brought into town on a bus, and they were grouped together in a class. [SEP] They had to	come	earlier in the morning and had to stay later in the afternoon, and most of them were poor, because if you tried to farm in the sand hills of NC, it was pretty hard to make a living. [SEP] The soil is not particularly fertile.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
She had been with us during her last illness, about six or eight weeks, where we were living in VA, and died there. [SEP] When we came home for the funeral we had not been in the house more than five minutes and here	come	the Lann twins across the street. [SEP] The first words out of their mouths, or out of one of them's mouths and their names were Augusta and Virginia, and I never knew who was who, so I don't know who asked the question.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Mother and her sister spent their days playing in the woods, wading in the creek, swimming on the scuppernong vines and sometimes picking berries and going fishing. [SEP] When the rain came my grandfather would tell Mother not to touch the tent with her finger because then the tent would leak so of course Mother would lay on her cot looking up at the tent close to her and touch it with her finger a slow drip would	come	and Mother would be in trouble but not as much trouble as when she was playing on the muddy creek bank and lost her shoe the only pair she had. [SEP] Thank goodness this happened shortly before their return to the city where she could got another pair.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasKay.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

[SEP] Well, we will tell a story about the, my mother and her sister and my grandfather, grandmother and the other five children went down to Chattanooga, where they had been raised in a place called Sequatchie Valley and my grandfather worked for the railroad.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

And in the midst, is the misty flats which most people choose, and then he went on to talk about the middle road being crowded uh, the low road meeting destruction, and disappointment, tragedy. [SEP] But, the high road leading to success and opportunities and even then, though we were quite young, he challenged us it seemed to get through that if we selected the high road that benefits had the possibilities of being numerous and sometimes when I'm out alone, when test and trials	come	, those words	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Growing up, almost everybody went to church and students went with them and it sure didn't make them perfect, but it seem to uh, place some fear in their minds, some people today I think have no fear, even fear of death. [SEP] They think they're going to	come	back, it's some temporary vacation and they don't realize when they use violence or they when they overdose how permanent it is. [SEP] So if we don't, people have different tendency of churches and religions, Judaism, Hinduism, ( ), Christianity and then you have Atheist.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
But if we don't use any of those, uh, we need something that can cause us to think and let us know that we are not really masters of our own fate, captains of our own souls, but uh, that we are dispensable, that we are passing through here for a short period of time. [SEP] It's important to make our mark in the sand and one way to do it certainly is to live a decent life and uh, if we can do that and add education competencies and skills that we can help lift someone else then uh, we would	come	to the end of the road with joy and happiness I think uh, saying that we have helped to make the world better.

And I remember all the headlights on all the cars were painted black for the first half, the first, the top semi-circle was black so that when if you went out at night, the light would shine just down on the road and not straight ahead. [SEP] Everybody had window shades, you didn't have blinds back then, but everybody had window shades that were blackout shades and you had to pull them down at night before you turned on any of the lights, because everyone was deathly afraid that the Germans or the Japanese were going to	come	bomb us.

[SEP] And we went down to Atlanta for him to talk to people down there and they told him that they couldn't do anything so if he really wanted to be in the army he needed to	come	back and go up to the Pentagon. [SEP] So we drove up to Washington, and he went to the Pentagon and tried really hard for them to take him back and they said that what he was doing with the post office was in the best interest of the government and the country and he could serve much better by getting the mail to the soldiers.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

you know maybe we've um got a turn around here maybe in the beginning we thought it wasn't such a good idea but perhaps if we instrumented it here in the US rather than taking all that manpower out of the US and providing a service for people to join here and do some good we could	come	up with some of those things we have we have a lot of people that are in college and we have a lot of people that  for one reason or another that that can't get into college either they can't afford it or or perhaps they don't have the abilities	#telephone#	telephone_sw2635-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
