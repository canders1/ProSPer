ace in conflicts over domestic production and imports—a theme that recurs throughout U.S. history. [SEP] For example, from the outset of the new nation, President George Washington and his Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton wanted to encourage U.S.-based industry. [SEP] Indeed, Washington wore a dark brown suit, entirely made in America, for his first inaugural on April 30, 1789.3 In this chapter, we will concentrate on the past hundred years, outlining major changes in American retail, apparel, and textiles that occurred before the 1980s. [SEP] The industrial transformation of this earlier period, which affected far more than these three industries, echoes today’s enormous shifts in supplier relations, manufacturing operations, and human resource practices. [SEP] The changes now	going	on have their analog in the last century, when technological innovations of the day like railroads, telegraph, and steam power—developed for purposes far afield of retail, apparel, or textiles—helped transform the mass distri-bution of goods and information. [SEP] Alfred Chandler described the last industrial transformation in his well-known book The Visible Hand. [SEP] The use of everything from railroads to an improved postal service, according to Chandler, created enterprises with internal administrative structures that coordinated the flow of goods from many individual producers to many more consumers. [SEP] This administrative coordination reduced “the number of transactions involved in the flow of goods, increased the speed and regularity of that flow, and so lowered costs and improve	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
he cloth without hitting the top of the vacuum table, supporting the lay of cloth on a brush between the fabric and the inlets to the vacuum table. [SEP] The stiff bristles of the brush were made of plastic with flat tops, similar in appearance to a flat-headed nail. [SEP] The flat tops supported the fabric. [SEP] The plastic bristles were stiff enough to support the fabric layer under the force of vacuum while remaining sufficiently flexible to deflect out of the path of the knife. [SEP] The most up-to-date versions of automatic-cutting equipment, including the GERBERcutter, are even more effective. [SEP] Cloth is cut by having the knife oscillate up and down while it moves along the silhouette of the apparel pieces in the marker. [SEP] The knife support tilts to keep the blade erect when	going	along curves. [SEP] Software can prevent lines from being cut twice; it can control the touchy job of cutting the apex of wedge-shaped pieces by approaching the point from both sides of the wedge rather than attempting to cut around the tip. [SEP] The vacuum tables have also become “smart.” [SEP] One level of vacuum is maintained over the general lay area; a higher level is arranged under the region being cut to keep the cloth fixed. [SEP] Yet despite the obvious advantages of computer-controlled cutting, only a minority of the business units in our survey (21 percent) were using this kind of equipment in 1992. [SEP] Most continued to use manually guided electric knives to do their cutting, including some of the largest business units in the sample.

d 24 months of age, and you will ﬁnd many expressions like these: “Tommy hit”; “Get cookie”; “Mommy truck” (meaning “Mommy push the truck”); “Daddy outside”; and “My dolly.”57 At the end of the second year, children begin to label their own and others’ internal states with words, such as “want,” “happy,” “mad,” “think,” and “pretend.”58 These assertions about human action, desire, emotion, and perspective are the stu of which narratives are made. [SEP] Early on, children are sensitive to yet another feature of narrative. [SEP] At birth, they are captivated by unusual events, perking up their eyes and ears when something new and dierent happens. [SEP] In keeping with this innate bias, the ﬁrst narratives children produce focus on making sense of the atypical. [SEP] “Look, the sun is sleepy,	going	to bed,” said 2 1/2-year-old David while watching the sun disappear below the horizon at the end of a day at the beach. [SEP] At the sight of a woman with her leg in a cast, 3-year-old Rachel remarked, “Mommy, that lady got a big cut. The doctor sewed up her leg.” (Rachel’s brother had cut his leg a few days earlier and returned from the doctor with stitches and a bandage.) An early armament of narrative tools enables children to quickly and easily comprehend and contribute to the narratives of expert members of their culture.59 [SEP] In families in which parents and children spend much time together, the ﬂow of stories recreating personal experiences is abundant.60 [SEP] Through them, adults help children construct increasingly elaborate images of themselves and teach them culturally accep	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
t the child’s socioeconomic or ethnic background.105 television viewing.   [SEP] In Chapter 1, I noted that according to current survey ﬁndings, American adults spend over one-third of their free time—about 15 hours per week—watching TV. [SEP] Estimates for children are even more ominous. [SEP] Regular TV viewing typically begins between 2 and 3 years of age, consuming about 10.5 hours per week, or nearly 13 percent of the child’s waking hours. [SEP] It rises steadily over early childhood until it reaches an average of 28 hours per week for school-age children, or about 30 percent of the child’s waking hours.106 [SEP] When we consider how much the set is on during school holidays and summer vacations, children spend more time watching TV than they do in any other waking activity, including	going	to school and interacting with family members or peers. [SEP] These statistics are averages; children dier in their attraction to television. [SEP] For example, parents who watch a lot of TV tend to have children who do the same. [SEP] Excessive TV viewing is associated with family and peer diculties, poor school achievement, and serious health concerns—speciﬁcally, overweight and obesity as a result of hours of being sedentary and eating high-fat snacks while viewing.107 [SEP] Parents with stressful, unhappy lives often escape into television, and their children may do so as well.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2

[SEP] “I can’t remember much family togetherness when I was a kid,” Hannah remarked. [SEP] “Our parents couldn’t talk things out with each other, and they rarely talked things out with us. Mom took Sarah and me to Girl Scouts, swimming, piano, and other lessons. We enjoyed the activities and the friends we made, but they couldn’t compensate for what was missing: warm, family time.

I’m	going	to start a bed over here for some other animals.” [SEP] Sophie turned toward the teddy bear, lifted his paw, and exclaimed, “She wants a lollipop to hold in her hand!”	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2

Piaget’s View: Exercising a New Symbolic Capacity Piaget acknowledged the emotional function of play, and he agreed that through pretending, children become familiar with social-role possibilities. [SEP] But he is best known for stressing the symbolic nature of make-believe. [SEP] Pretending, Piaget pointed out, is a vital means of mentally representing the world that, along with gestures, language, and drawings, develops rapidly in early childhood. [SEP] Through it, children practice and strengthen their capacity to represent their experiences.3 [SEP] For example, when Sophie pretended to put the animals to bed and used a TinkerToy to stand for a lollipop, she represented in her mind what formerly she could experience only directly—by	going	to bed or sucking a lollipop. [SEP] Practicing and solidifying modes of representation, Piaget emphasized, make it possible for the child to free thought from the here and now; create larger images of reality that take into account past, present, and future; and transform those images mentally in the service of logical thinking. [SEP] Nevertheless, Piaget was convinced that by itself, make-believe play does little to advance children’s development. [SEP] Rather, children merely exercise playfully the symbols they have acquired in other contexts.4 [SEP] Much like his view of private speech as egocentric and nonsocial, Piaget believed that at ﬁrst pretend play is a solitary activity in which the child uses highly personal symbols that cannot easily be interpreted by others.

[SEP] Although Traci showed little interest in the movie, her ears perked up at a statement in the sound track reporting the death of the mother of the Trapp-family children. [SEP] Traci began to ask questions, to talk about how the mother must have gotten sick and gone to the hospital, and to repeat that the mother had died. [SEP] For the next hour and a half, she assigned her own mother and herself at least ﬁfteen different roles—mother, father, baby, sister, doctor, nurse, and more—as she explored the idea of a mother dying: Traci: “Here, you’re the baby and I’m the mama.

In Chapter 2, I also noted that it is crucial for parents to model good viewing practices; to watch TV with children, helping them understand and evaluate what they see; and to use televised content as inspiration for make-believe play and other enriching activities. [SEP] Another suggestion: Try not to use television to reward or punish children. [SEP] This increases its attractiveness, making children want to watch all the more.

[SEP] Already, my daughter bangs on the keys and uses the mouse. [SEP] How much is too much and how young is too young? [SEP] More than half of American families own a personal computer, and one-third of these have access to the Internet—rates that are growing rapidly.6 [SEP] It’s not surprising that even very young children are attracted to the computer—often more so than to television.

TV controls itself.”7 Your key-banging, mouse-clicking 20-month-old already seems to appreciate this sense of electronic control!	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
nt. [SEP] Children who have too much typically care little for what they have. [SEP] When given a chance to acquire something new, they usually don’t react with much excitement or selectivity. [SEP] For materially indulged children, new toys are such a common event that a complacent attitude sets in. [SEP] The child comes to think, if I don’t like what I just got, I can always discard it for something else. [SEP] A bedroom or playroom heaped high with a jumble of toys, many broken and mistreated, also teaches children that possessions need not be cared for and respected. [SEP] Parents often assume that the play materials children choose are the ones that are best for their development. [SEP] To some degree, this assumption makes sense: If a toy isn’t appealing to the child, the child isn’t	going	to spend time with it. [SEP] So it’s important to provide children with a variety of play materials responsive to their interests. [SEP] Nevertheless, preference is not the same as appropriateness. [SEP] Children sometimes choose toys with very limited play possibilities and soon ignore them. [SEP] Other toys should not be given to children because they encourage undesirable play behaviors. [SEP] Guns and other forms of weaponry fall into this category. [SEP] In Chapter 4, I pointed to research demonstrating that these aggressive play materials promote both make-believe and real hostility in children’s interactions with peers.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
] When frustrated, they haven’t yet developed many techniques for regulating their emotions. [SEP] But parents who take mental notes for a day on the number of compliant acts versus the number of tantrums are likely to gain a new appreciation for how infrequent their child’’s tantrums really are. [SEP] For most young children, eager, willing cooperation is much more common than opposition.26 [SEP] If your child has been emotionally reactive and difficult to soothe since infancy, then temperament is probably a signiﬁcant contributor to his behavior. [SEP] You’ll also want to consider whether any changes in your family or the child’s daily life might be sparking intense anxiety—marital conﬂict, divorce or remarriage, a new baby brother or sister, starting preschool or child care, or a parent	going	to work when the child is used to having him or her at home. [SEP] Parenting practices can modify children’s temperaments and assist them in coping with stressful life events. [SEP] Protection from family discord; extra parental warmth, affection, and pleasurable time together when the child is behaving well; and ﬁrm, calm, and consistent discipline will help. [SEP] Most children build up to a tantrum gradually. [SEP] Parents can tell it’s in the offing, and sometimes they can distract the child before it reaches a peak.

 as she goes up in smoke. [SEP] If the girl doesn’t die, as in some stories, she might suffer a burn on the shoulder or a man’s handprint might be found on her back. [SEP] A small circle of people who are present at the dance observe this encounter, and the narrator of the story usually says that she or he heard it from someone who was there. [SEP] The lesson learned is that one must not disobey one’s parents, for the handsome man is known to be the devil and the personification of evil. [SEP] It is noted that mostly women narrate these legends, among themselves or from mothers to daughters, in a didactic fashion, to instill fear in young women so that they will not disregard parental authority. [SEP] In some variants a young girl specifically transgresses religious beliefs by insisting on	going	to a dance on Good Friday, a religious holy day, and a revered day of prayer in Chicano Catholic households. [SEP] The appearance of the devil on this day is an especially ominous sign. [SEP] Robe’s collection of New Mexico legends contains thirty-four variants of the devil-at-the-dance tale. [SEP] Although the legends in this collection are from rural northern New Mexico, collected in the 1950s and 1960s, we find contemporary versions of the devil-at-the-dance tales in south Texas and in Baja California from the 1980s.

[SEP] Since at least the 1920s, Chicanos from Texas have been making what came to be called burritos.

weak and defenseless. [SEP] Although each of the constitutional efforts to intervene on behalf of the powerless has a different impulse and a different agenda, they all spring from a root concern for those who are not strong enough to act for themselves. [SEP] This is the common thread that begins in the Thirteenth Amendment, peaks, perhaps wrongly, in Prohibition, and issues today into the movement “to stand by victims, to restore their dignity, to find a way for them to think of themselves, once again, as men and women equal to all others.” [SEP] The opposition to victims’ rights stems from both prosecutors and defense counsel. [SEP] The former do not want victims complicating the trial. [SEP] They are surely opposed to my proposal that victims be able to veto plea bargains and insist on	going	to trial to vindicate their charges.11 [SEP] Prosecutors generally like to have victims around at the sentencing phase. [SEP] The suffering and rage of the victims, when expressed in court, tends to spike the punishment. [SEP] Defense counsel are opposed for other reasons. [SEP] They are afraid that empowering victims will distract from the rights of criminal defendants, but this is not necessarily the case.12 [SEP] The victim’s interest is primarily in participating in the trial.

are good arguments that draw on a long tradition of concern in the theory of equality for protecting the weak and defenseless. [SEP] The alternative mode of compassionate jurisprudence relies on the concept of human dignity, elaborated in Article 1 of the German Basic Law of 1949. [SEP] The term “human dignity” is not defined in the Basic Law and, therefore, the courts must rely on the basic Kantian principles that human dignity expresses the ultimate personhood of each individual. [SEP] In my view, although we have never expressed a principle of human dignity in American constitutional law, the same principle underlies our commitment to the Great Maxim. [SEP] Our notion of equality-in-creation derives from the view that we are all of ultimate value, an idea that can be expressed either by	going	back to the biblical idea of creation in the image of God or taking the secular alternative of human dignity beyond all price, as articulated in Kant’s moral theory.24 [SEP] To see how the notion of human dignity operates in practice, let us take a look at the well-known Peep Show case decided in 1981 by the Federal Administrative Court [Bundesverwaltungsgericht] in Germany.25 [SEP] The operators of a peep show were denied a business permit because their show supposedly violated the morals of the community.

at, I think, is right in front of us = always the hardest thing to see. [SEP] This book is the fruit of these eVorts. [SEP] And this first chapter is but an introduction, in brief, to the themes that will be explained more fully in the following chapters. [SEP] I would ask the reader to be patient with unfamiliar terms and concepts. [SEP] My first eVorts had begun with twin questions. [SEP] First, in addition to the known laws of thermodynamics, could there possibly be a fourth law of thermodynamics for open thermodynamic systems, some law that governs biospheres anywhere in the cosmos or the cosmos itself? [SEP] Second, living entities = bacteria, plants, and animals = manipulate the world on their own behalf: the bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient that is easily said to be	going	to get “dinner”; the paramecium, cilia beating like a Roman warship’s oars, hot after the bacterium; we humans earning our livings. [SEP] Call the bacterium, paramecium, and us humans “autonomous agents,” able to act on our own behalf in an environment. [SEP] My second and core question became, What must a physical system be to be an autonomous agent? [SEP] Make no mistake, we autonomous agents mutually construct our biosphere, even as we coevolve in it. [SEP] Why and how this is so is a central subject of all that follows.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2

[SEP] Then Ludwig Boltzmann and Willard Gibbs taught us how to calculate macroscopic properties such as pressure and temperature as equilibrium averages over the configuration space.

[SEP] What if we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and calculate with Newton’s “method of fluxions,” the calculus, from initial and boundary conditions and laws? [SEP] Whether we can calculate or not does not slow down the persistent evolution of novelty in the biosphere. [SEP] But a biosphere is just another physical system.

xpected directions. [SEP] One direction suggests that an answer to this question may demand a fundamental alteration in how we have done science since Newton. [SEP] Life is doing something far richer than we may have dreamed, literally something incalculable. [SEP] What is the place of law if, as hinted above, the variables and configuration space cannot be prespecified for a biosphere, or perhaps a universe? [SEP] Yet, I think, there are laws. [SEP] And if these musings be true, we must rethink science itself. [SEP] Perhaps I can point again at the outset to the central question of an autonomous agent. [SEP] Consider a bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient, its flagellar motor rotating. [SEP] If we naively ask, “What is it doing?” we unhesitatingly answer something like, “It’s	going	to get dinner.” [SEP] That is, without attributing consciousness or conscious purpose, we view the bacterium as acting on its own behalf in an environment. [SEP] The bacterium is swimming upstream in order to obtain the glucose it needs. [SEP] Presumably we have in mind something like the Darwinian criteria to unpack the phrase, “on its own behalf.” [SEP] Bacteria that do obtain glucose or its equivalent may survive with higher probability than those incapable of the flagellar motor trick, hence, be selected by natural selection. [SEP] An autonomous agent is a physical system, such as a bacterium, that can act on its own behalf in an environment. [SEP] All free-living cells and organisms are clearly autonomous agents.

tieth-century philosopher Ludwig Witt-gen-stein said something similar in his majestic Philosophical Investigations. [SEP] Witt-genstein came to his revolutionary investigations painfully, ultimately rejecting his own earlier triumph in the Tractatus. [SEP] Indeed, part of why I have so blatantly borrowed Wittgenstein’s title, without my presumption to similar intellectual stature, is that there is a parallel between Wittgenstein’s abandonment of the Tractatus and growing awareness of knowing as living a language game, and a central theme of this Investigations, that there may be a limit to the way Newton taught us to do science and a need to reformulate what we do when we and other agents get on with living a life. [SEP] As we will see, in both cases, it appears that something profound is	going	on in the universe that is not finitely prestatable. [SEP] Life and language games seem persistently open to radical innovations that cannot be deduced from previous categories and concepts. [SEP] I will only be able to discuss these issues more fully after we have encountered autonomous agents and their unfolding mysteries. [SEP] In his early Tractatus, Wittgenstein had brought to conclusion the mandate of logical atomism from Russell. [SEP] Logical atomism sought a firm epistemological foundation for all knowledge in terms of privileged “atomic statements” about “sense data.” [SEP] The idea, flowing from Hume to Berkeley to Kant then back to British empiricism, was the following: One might be mistaken in saying that a chair is in the room, but one could hardly be mistaken in reporting bit	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
There is no finitely prespecifiable list of statements about ordinary human actions whose truth would be necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement that the jury found Henderson guilty of murder. [SEP] Another example concerns the United Kingdom	going	to war with Germany. [SEP] There is no finitely prespecifiable set of ways this must happen. [SEP] Thus, the queen, one day after tea, might betake herself to Parliament and cry, “We are at war with Germany!” [SEP] Or the prime minister might in Parliament say, “Members, by the authority of my oYce I declare that we are at war with Germany!” [SEP] Or ten thousand irate football fans from Leeds might shoulder picks, take to barges, funnel in fury up the Rhine, and attack football fans in Koblenz. [SEP] Or   .    [SEP] .   .   . In short, there is no prestatable set of necessary and suYcient conditions about the actions of individual humans for the United Kingdom to manage to go to war with Germany. (And may neither nation again find a way to make war on the other in the future.) Wittgenstein	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
 from step 2 to step 3, the end of the power stroke, a point where the pressure is at the lowest point, and the volume of the working gas is at the highest point of the work cycle. [SEP] Now in order to return the Carnot engine to its initial state, 1 (in Figure 3.2), such that the working gas can again expand and do mechanical work on the piston, work must be done on the engine to bring the piston back up to its position near the head of the cylinder and to recompress and reheat the working gas so that its temperature and pressure values, or state, correspond to state 1. [SEP] If the work done on the Carnot engine simply retraced the exact pathway from step 3 to step 2 to step 1, at least as much work would have to be done on the Carnot engine as the engine released in the power stroke in	going	from 1 to 2 to 3. [SEP] If so, no net work would be carried out by the Carnot engine on the external world. [SEP] Instead of retracing the power stroke pathway, the Carnot engine, and all heat engines, use a simple trick. [SEP] You will do it. [SEP] At step 3, the end of the power stroke, you push on the handle, pushing the cylinder into contact with the low-temperature reservoir, T2. [SEP] Indeed, you have arranged things such that at the end of the power stroke the working gas is itself at this lower temperature, T2.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
ll carries out a wide variety of molecular activities, including the turning on and o of transcription of genes into RNA; the processing of that RNA into mature messenger RNA; the translation of that RNA into proteins, the activities of many of those proteins as enzymes to catalyze reaction, the modification of the activities of enzymes by chemical events such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation; the building of structural components such as bilipid membrane, and microtubule assembly and disassembly; and the construction of proteins and other receptors. [SEP] These receptors are located transmembrane at the cell boundary and elsewhere in the cell, including on nuclear membranes of eukaryotes, such that signal molecules can be detected and responded to. [SEP] So, lots of activities are	going	on all the time, in parallel, in your typical E. coli, yeast, or your own pancreatic cells. [SEP] The proper conceptual framework to think about all this activity is the “state space” of the system. [SEP] If we ignore geometry, that is, the locations of molecules relative to one another in the cell  which is a big idealization  then the state space of a cell consists of a list of all the molecular species and their “activities” or “concentrations.” [SEP] In the following, I will focus on the behavior of the genetic regulatory network.

It all began at the Santa Fe Institute several years ago. [SEP] Steve Harris, a molecular biologist from Texas was visiting. [SEP] I told him about canalyzing functions. [SEP] “Never,” said Steve. [SEP] Seeing my opportunity I replied, “You have a good genetics library, want to read a bunch of papers and analyze the transcription rules of genes with three or four or five known regulatory inputs?” [SEP] I didn’t think Steve would say yes, for the reading of over a hundred papers in the subsequent years, and cataloging the detailed results, was	going	to be a substantial task.

Dandy, the mock community was stable. [SEP] They kept adding randomly chosen species. [SEP] At first, it was easy to add new species, but it became progressively harder until no more species could be added. [SEP] The deep mystery is, why? [SEP] It is not a lack of food or energy. [SEP] Furthermore, on the way to assembling the community, Stuart and Mack began to notice that as the community filled up, addition of one species could make one or more other species go locally extinct. [SEP] They began to find evidence of power law distributions of such extinction events. [SEP] Why? [SEP] No one knows for sure, and Stuart has some wonderful ideas discussed in his fine book, The Balance of Nature. [SEP] But I am	going	to move on to the recent ideas of Bruce Sawhill and Tim Keitt, which build on the work of physicist Scott Kirkpatrick. [SEP] Scott is famous for coinventing the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model and hangs out at IBM being smart. [SEP] Not long ago, he took up what is called the “Ksat” problem. [SEP] Here is the Ksat problem. [SEP] Consider some logical formula, or expression, as in our Boolean net. [SEP] Any Boolean expression can be cast in “normal disjunctive form”; an example is (A or A) and (A or A) and (not A or not A). [SEP] In such an expression the variables between brackets constitute a “clause,” so this logical expression has three clauses. [SEP] The clauses are linked by “and.” [SEP] Thus, for the entire statement to be true, all three clauses must be true.

Thus, this model shows an invisible hand in which natural selection, acting on individuals only, tunes landscape ruggedness. [SEP] All players are, on average, fitter in the sense of surviving as species for much longer periods, yet the ecosystem appears self-organized critical with a power law distribution of extinction events. [SEP] Species lifetime distributions are also power laws. [SEP] Does this model apply to the real world? [SEP] There is now considerable evidence that over the past million years the size distribution of extinction events in the record, in terms of the number of species	going	extinct per -million-year period, is best understood as a power law, with many small and few large extinction events, (Figure .). [SEP] Furthermore, the lifetime distribution of species, as well as genera and families, is, indeed, a power law (Figure .a,b). [SEP] I have discussed my own model primarily to focus on the fact that coevolution by self-natural selection alone acting on individuals alone can tune landscape ruggedness so those landscapes are self-consistently well searched by the creatures searching them and their search mechanisms. [SEP] We can, and presumably do, self-consistently coconstruct ourselves, our niches (and hence problem spaces), and our search mechanisms such that, on average, we propagate ourselves and our descendants.

 occur and stock prices should hover in the vicinity of their fundamental value, typically understood as the discounted present value of the future revenue stream from the stock. [SEP] But, in fact, abundant trading does occur, and speculative bubbles and crashes occur. [SEP] Rational expectations theory is built up around another fixed-point theorem. [SEP] Rational expectations theory assumes a set of economic agents with beliefs about how the economy is working. [SEP] The agents base their economic actions on those beliefs. [SEP] A fixed point can exist under which the actions of the agents, given their beliefs about the economy, exactly create the expected economic behavior. [SEP] So, under rational expectations one can understand bubbles. [SEP] It is rational to believe that prices are	going	above fundamental value and thus to invest, and the investments sustain the bubble for a period of time. [SEP] Meanwhile, Homo economicus has been thought to be infinitely rational. [SEP] In the Arrow-Debreu setting, such infinitely rational agents bargain and achieve the best equilibrium price for each dated contingent good. [SEP] In rational expectations, the agents figure out how the economy is working and behave in such a way that the expected economic system is the one that arises. [SEP] The theories and actions of the agents self-consistently create an economy fitting the theories under which the agents operate.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2

No one at the FAA or the airlines that day had ever dealt with multiple hijackings. [SEP] Such a plot had not been carried out anywhere in the world in more than 30 years, and never in the United States. [SEP] As news of the hijackings filtered through the FAA and the airlines, it does not seem to have occurred to their leadership that they needed to alert other aircraft in the air that they too might be at risk. [SEP] United 175 was hijacked between 8:42 and 8:46, and awareness of that hijacking began to spread after 8:51. [SEP] American 77 was hijacked between 8:51 and 8:54. [SEP] By 9:00, FAA and airline officials began to comprehend that attackers were	going	after multiple aircraft. [SEP] American Airlines' nationwide ground stop between 9:05 and 9:10 was followed by a United Airlines ground stop. [SEP] FAA controllers at Boston Center, which had tracked the first two hijackings, requested at 9:07 that Herndon Command Center "get messages to airborne aircraft to increase security for the cockpit." [SEP] There is no evidence that Herndon took such action. [SEP] Boston Center immediately began speculating about other aircraft that might be in danger, leading them to worry about a transcontinental flight-Delta 1989-that in fact was not hijacked. [SEP] At 9:19, the FAA's New England regional office called Herndon and asked that Cleveland Center advise Delta 1989 to use extra cockpit security. [SEP] Several FAA air traffic control officials told us 	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
 22 Air Route Traffic Control Centers. [SEP] They are grouped under regional offices and coordinate closely with the national Air Traffic Control System Command Center, located in Herndon, Virginia, which oversees daily traffic flow within the entire airspace system. [SEP] FAA headquarters is ultimately responsible for the management of the National Airspace System. [SEP] The Operations Center located at FAA headquarters receives notifications of incidents, including accidents and hijackings. [SEP] FAA Control Centers often receive information and make operational decisions independently of one another. [SEP] On 9/11, the four hijacked aircraft were monitored mainly by the centers in Boston, New York, Cleveland, and Indianapolis. [SEP] Each center thus had part of the knowledge of what was	going	on across the system. [SEP] What Boston knew was not necessarily known by centers in New York, Cleveland, or Indianapolis, or for that matter by the Command Center in Herndon or by FAA headquarters in Washington. [SEP] Controllers track airliners such as the four aircraft hijacked on 9/11 primarily by watching the data from a signal emitted by each aircraft's transponder equipment. [SEP] Those four planes, like all aircraft traveling above 10,000 feet, were required to emit a unique transponder signal while in flight.	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2

[SEP] At 9:05, Boston Center confirmed for both the FAA Command Center and the New England Region that the hijackers aboard American 11 said "we have planes." [SEP] At the same time, New York Center declared "ATC zero"-meaning that aircraft were not permitted to depart from, arrive at, or travel through New York Center's airspace until further notice. [SEP] Within minutes of the second impact, Boston Center instructed its controllers to inform all aircraft in its airspace of the events in New York and to advise aircraft to heighten cockpit security.

 American 77 was missing, and it had come by chance. [SEP] If NEADS had not placed that call, the NEADS air defenders would have received no information whatsoever that the flight was even missing, although the FAA had been searching for it. [SEP] No one at FAA headquarters ever asked for military assistance with American 77. [SEP] At 9:36, the FAA's Boston Center called NEADS and relayed the discovery about an unidentified aircraft closing in on Washington:"Latest report. Aircraft VFR [visual flight rules] six miles southeast of the White House. . . . Six, southwest. Six, southwest of the White House, deviating away." [SEP] This startling news prompted the mission crew commander at NEADS to take immediate control of the airspace to clear a flight path for the Langley fighters:"Okay, we're	going	to turn it . . . crank it up. . . . Run them to the White House." [SEP] He then discovered, to his surprise, that the Langley fighters were not headed north toward the Baltimore area as instructed, but east over the ocean. [SEP] " I don't care how many windows you break," he said. [SEP] " Damn it. . . . Okay. Push them back." [SEP] The Langley fighters were heading east, not north, for three reasons. [SEP] First, unlike a normal scramble order, this order did not include a distance to the target or the target's location. [SEP] Second, a "generic" flight plan-prepared to get the aircraft airborne and out of local airspace quickly-incorrectly led the Langley fighters to believe they were ordered to fly due east (090) for 60 miles.

o evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington. [SEP] Indeed, it is not clear to us that the video teleconference was fully under way before 9:37, when the Pentagon was struck. [SEP] Garvey, Belger, and other senior officials from FAA headquarters participated in this video teleconference at various times. [SEP] We do not know who from Defense participated, but we know that in the first hour none of the personnel involved in managing the crisis did. [SEP] And none of the information conveyed in the White House video teleconference, at least in the first hour, was being passed to the NMCC. [SEP] As one witness recalled, "[It] was almost like there were parallel decisionmaking processes	going	on; one was a voice conference orchestrated by the NMCC . . . and then there was the [White House video teleconference]. . . . [I]n my mind they were competing venues for command and control and decisionmaking." [SEP] At 10:03, the conference received reports of more missing aircraft, "2 possibly 3 aloft," and learned of a combat air patrol over Washington. [SEP] There was discussion of the need for rules of engagement. [SEP] Clarke reported that they were asking the President for authority to shoot down aircraft. [SEP] Confirmation of that authority came at 10:25, but the commands were already being conveyed in more direct contacts with the Pentagon.	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2

[SEP] Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room, but as far as we could determine, no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon. [SEP] The focus was on the President's statement to the nation. [SEP] The only decision made during this time was to return to Washington. [SEP] The President's motorcade departed at 9:35, and arrived at the airport between 9:42 and 9:45. [SEP] During the ride the President learned about the attack on the Pentagon. [SEP] He boarded the aircraft, asked the Secret Service about the safety of his family, and called the Vice President.

[SEP] He said the President signed off on that concept. [SEP] The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. [SEP] The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. [SEP] The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. [SEP] Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, "Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're	going	to want to know what to do." [SEP] Then she recalled hearing him say, "Yes sir."

Lovina Beach The beaches west of Singaraja began to attract escapist travelers in the early 1970s, and simple and fairly inexpensive accommodations were built to house them. [SEP] Slowly the number of visitors grew and the small homestays turned themselves into larger bungalow-type hotels. [SEP] Today, tour groups come for short stays and, as everywhere in Bali, standards and prices are steadily	going	up. [SEP] Actually, Lovina is not one village but a string of small ones, starting 6 km (4 miles) west of Singaraja and continuing for 10 km (6 miles) up the coast road. [SEP] Shops, restaurants, and moneychangers are scattered along the busy stretch. [SEP] The beach itself is shallow and gently shelving, making it an ideal place for small children. [SEP] There is calm water on the inside of the reef and good snorkeling over it. [SEP] Lovina’s dark sand is less inviting than the white or golden variety at the southern resorts, and gets too hot to walk on in bare feet in the middle of the day.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
You won’t find many notable temples, palaces, or other historic sites, but visitors to Lombok are rewarded with the pleasures of the island’s relaxed, rustic ways: the sight of water buffaloes and their calves; hens, and chicks dashing across your path; sudden views of blue sea dotted with sails.

[SEP] Some villages are renowned for their traditional crafts — intricate basketry, weaving, pottery, or carving.

Barcelona is hardly Madrid or Seville when it comes to tablaos—live flamenco performances, though a few shows target the tourist trade: Tablao Flamenco Cordobés (Las Ramblas, 35; Tel. 93/317 66 53) is the most popular and predictable, while El Patio Andaluz (Aribau, 242; Tel 93/209 33 78) also puts on sevillanas, more traditional southern-style singing and dancing. [SEP] There are also flamenco shows twice nightly, except Monday, at El Tablao de Carmen in the Poble Espanyol on Montjuïc (Arcos, 9; tel. 93/325 68 95). [SEP] For one-stop partying among those interested more in convenience than quality, the Poble Espanyol features jazz clubs, flamenco performances, big-bands, theater, bars, and discos	going	strong until 4am. [SEP] Two classic Barcelona cafes that are perfect for getting started or winding down are Café de la Ópera (La Rambla, 74) and Els Quatre Gats (Montsió, 3). [SEP] An excellent wine bar, with a great list of Spanish wines, is El Senyor de la Vinya, right across from the Santa María del Mar church. [SEP] In good weather, it and another nearby bar set tables out in the plaza, which is unequaled for ambience. [SEP] A cavernous bodega that became immediately popular with wine lovers is the new but ancient-looking Va de Vi (Banys Vells, 16), near the Picasso Museum. [SEP] It features a superb wine list and excellent tapas, cheeses and embutidos (Spanish hams, sausages and other cold cuts).

El Molino (Vila i Vila, 99) is one of Barcelona’s oldest cabarets. [SEP] Cabaret of the distinctly kitschy kind is the nightly rule at Bodega Bohemia (Lancaster, 2), on the west side of La Rambla. [SEP] Live jazz most nights of the week can be found at Harlem Jazz Club in the Gothic Quarter (c/ Comtessa de Sobradiel, 8), probably the city’s best jazz club. [SEP] For live flamenco or pop flamenco, head to Los Tarantos, or for jazz, to Jamboree, both on the Plaça Reial. [SEP] Luz de Gas (Muntaner, 246) and Otto Zutz (Lincoln, 15) continue to be the reigning dance clubs, which don’t get	going	until well after midnight. [SEP] The latest in modern dance, music, and experimental theater is regularly staged in the evenings at the Mercat de les Flors, the old flower market a short walk from the spectacular sound-and-light show of the Font Màgica (see page 68). [SEP] If you’re lucky enough to be in the city during a festival—either a religious or secular holiday—you’ll see the city’s different neighborhoods erupt into a carnival. [SEP] Food, fireworks, music, costumes, and especially the huge papier-mâché effigies called gégants (giants) and their comical companions, the cabezudos (bigheads), are essential fiesta features. [SEP] Each neighborhood has its own identifying models. [SEP] The gégants are about 4 meters (13 feet) high and elaborately dressed as kings and queens, knights, la	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
From its beginnings more than two thousand years ago, Barcelona has grown outwards in rings, like concentric ripples on a pond. [SEP] The ancient core is a hill the Romans called Mons Taber, where they raised a temple to Augustus Caesar and in the fourth century a.d. built high walls about a mile around to protect their settlement. [SEP] This is the nucleus of the medieval district called the Barri Gòtic. [SEP] While much of it is not technically Gothic, it is a remarkable concentration of medieval palaces, convents, and churches. [SEP] The best place to begin a tour of the quarter is the Catedral — Barcelona’s superb cathedral, which is the neighborhood’s major site and focal point. [SEP] The cathedral was begun in 1298 on the site of earlier churches	going	back to Visigothic times. [SEP] The final touch — the rather florid Gothic façade — was not completed until the end of the 19th century and thus contrasts with the simple octagonal towers. [SEP] The ribs of the cathedral’s high vault are joined at carved and painted keystone medallions, a typically Catalan feature. [SEP] In the center of the nave is a splendid Gothic choir with lacy spires of carved wood. [SEP] Above these are the heraldic emblems of the European kings and princes invited by Charles V to be members of his exclusive Order of the Golden Fleece (Toison d’Or). [SEP] The first and only meeting was held in the cathedral in 1519. [SEP] The seats reserved for Henry VIII of England and François I of France are next to the emperor’s, but they didn’t bother to come.

For live jazz, the best bets are the CD Café Jazz Club (Third Ring Road East) on weekends and the Sanwei Bookstore (60 Fuxingmenwai Dajie) on Friday nights. [SEP] Beijing’s plushest jazz club — often attracting international performers to its piano bar — is Aria, an upscale bar and grill located in the China World Hotel (1 Jianguomenwai Dajie). [SEP] Fans of disco (which is not a dying fad in Beijing) have made the Hot Spot (south of the Jiangguang New World Hotel) the hottest dance venue in town, with stage shows and caged dancers	going	strong every night until 2am. [SEP] Other popular disco venues include NASA (2 Xitucheng Lu, Haidian District), stuffed with military motifs, and Poachers Inn the Park (Tuanjiehu Park), with its English pub and stone dance floor. [SEP] The most international late-night dance floor is at Beijing’s own Hard Rock Cafe (8 Dongsanhuan Bei Lu), the first such franchise in China, with hamburgers, fries, beer, a Chinese staff, and live (and loud) music nightly.

Berlin showed its sense of the times with its mastery of film, the 20th-century art form. [SEP] Fritz Lang, F.W. Murnau, G.W. Pabst, and Ernst Lubitsch were the leading directors of their generation. [SEP] While Hollywood had considered cinema to be principally an industry of mass entertainment, the Berlin film-makers added a new perception of its artistic possibilities with M, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Lulu, and Nosferatu. [SEP] After seeing Fritz Lang’s premonitory fable of human regimentation, Metropolis, Hitler wanted the master of the dark spectacle to make publicity films for him. [SEP] Berlin was	going	through a wild time, but the Versailles peace treaty had laid heavy burdens on the nation. [SEP] At the start of the twenties, inflation had made little more than nonsense of the German currency, and political assassinations became routine. [SEP] The most significant of the victims was foreign minister Walther Rathenau, an enlightened democrat and Jew who was killed near the Grunewald forest. [SEP] It was also the time of vicious street battles between Communists and Nazis, exploiting the social disruptions of inflation and unemployment that were impossible to ignore.

ardner Museum. [SEP] Modeled on a Venetian loggia, the cloister, delicate arches, and salmon-pink marble walls enclose a stunning, atmospheric space lined with mosaic and filled with foliage and classical statuary. [SEP] Isabella Gardner created Fenway Court in 1903 to hold her outstanding collection of art. [SEP] A flamboyant New Yorker, her unconventional ways scandalized the Boston Brahmins on more than one occasion. [SEP] Her portrait by John Singer Sargent (in the Gothic Room) captures her individuality and her eccentricity lives on in her will, which stipulates that all of the 2,000 pieces on display in the house must be left exactly where they are. [SEP] This decree is qualified by the condition that were anything to change, the museum’s contents would be sold off, with the proceeds	going	to Harvard University. [SEP] It’s an extraordinary place filled with great art works which are displayed idiosyncratically in often (for the time) innovative ways. [SEP] It’s more a personal home than a museum and the works are often poorly lit and cursorily labeled. [SEP] Each of the rooms displays art of a particular artist — Titian, Raphael, or Veronese — or style — Dutch, Gothic, or early Italian.

nd the CambridgeSide Galleria. [SEP] The impressive waterfront mall has a number of large department stores and many smaller specialty shops. [SEP] You could spend a whole day in the Museum of Science complex that straddles the Charles River, playing and learning on the 400-plus interactive exhibits. [SEP] Some of these, such as those on mathematics and biotechnology would stimulate an MIT graduate, while many others appeal to young children. [SEP] Highlights include: the electron microscope that magnifies objects 25,000 times; a variety of dinosaur models and fossils; games that show how the human body works; stimulating games for learning about energy; and a rain forest re-creation. [SEP] The demonstrations are thrilling too. [SEP] Try to catch the world’s biggest Van de Graaff generator	going	through its paces at the Theater of Electricity. [SEP] In late 1999 The Museum of Science announced that it was merging with the old Computer Museum and so the museum now has a couple of interactive computer-oriented exhibits. [SEP] There are also laser and stargazing shows in the Planetarium, and brilliant 3-D films shown in the Mugar Omni Theater.

 has a history as a spa stretching back to Roman times. [SEP] The main square, called Gyógy tér (meaning Health/Therapeutic Square), is a handsome place where the local mineral water bubbles up from the ground beneath a pagoda-like well-head. [SEP] On three sides of the square stand grand old buildings: the 18th-century Horváth House, once an inn, now a miner’s sanatorium; the Trade Union Sanatorium of 1802, and the Cardiac Hospital, which has treated heart patients from all over the world. [SEP] The small grove in front of the square has a number of trees dedicated by personalities who have visited here, including Indira Gandhi. [SEP] Just off the square is Blaha Lujza utca, with a ﬁne 1867 villa. [SEP] On the opposite side of the road is the best coffee house on the lake: Kedves has been	going	strong for two centuries and once you’ve tasted their chocolate cake you’ll understand why. [SEP] At the end of this street is a rotund church built in the 1840s, and a small museum to the Hungarian author Mór Jókai (closed November to February). [SEP] It is not all cures, coffee, and culture here: Balatonfüred is also one of the lake’s liveliest resorts, bustling by day and night. [SEP] One of the most attractive spots on Lake Balaton is the village of Tihany. [SEP] The place gives its name to a peninsula which almost cuts the lake in two and ends at the ferry point of Tihanyi-rév, where there is a Club Med-style camp and hotel offering a gamut of entertainment. [SEP] The peninsula is unspoiled and protected by its National Park status.

Russian Hill is less opulent than Nob Hill, but the gardens and immaculate little cottages of this fashionable residential area make it far more appealing. [SEP] The roller-coaster dips and crests of the city’s hills, breaking up the monotony of the standard grid system of streets, reach a crazy climax on Lombard Street between Hyde and Leavenworth. [SEP] After you’ve negotiated all eight hairpin bends lined with gardens of hydrangeas, you’re not	going	to quibble about the claim that it’s the “crookedest street in the world.” [SEP] Two blocks south is Filbert Street, boasting the steepest slope — a stomach-churning 31.5 percent gradient, with no bends. [SEP] It is worth climbing to the top of Telegraph Hill for the view of the bay from the top of Coit Tower, built in 1934 to honor the city’s fire department. [SEP] One of San Francisco’s many landmarks, its shape is not meant to resemble the nozzle of a fire hose, as is so often reported. [SEP] Inside you will find Socialist Realist murals depicting “Life in California, 1934.” [SEP] Take a look at the cottages and gardens around the Greenwich Steps, clinging to the steep slope overlooking the bay — this is one of the city’s most desirable addresses.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
r attention is the chatter of Chinese voices, the crowds, the color, the smells of five-spice and dried shrimp — it’s a little corner of Hong Kong right in the middle of California. [SEP] At Columbus Avenue, Chinatown spills over into North Beach, a Little Italy of cafés, bakeries, restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee houses. [SEP] This lively neighborhood, the center of the Italian community, was once the focus of the city’s intellectual and artistic life. [SEP] From the days when the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti gathered fellow Beats around his City Lights Bookstore during the 1950s, North Beach has been a hangout for the bohemian literary crowd. [SEP] City Lights (261 Columbus Avenue; open daily until midnight) opened in 1953 and was America’s first paperback bookshop. [SEP] It’s still	going	strong today. [SEP] Once you’ve bought your copy of On the Road, cross Jack Kerouac Street and settle down with your purchase over a drink at Vesuvio’s, another famous literary hangout. [SEP] Or if it’s a sunny day, buy a sandwich from a delicatessen and enjoy a picnic on Washington Square, a splash of green overlooked by the white spires of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul, where Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio were married in 1954.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
On Church Street you’ll find the site of Father Serra’s original adobe church. [SEP] Rebuilt in 1795, it is now the Royal Presidio Chapel (or Cathedral of San Carlos de Borromeo). [SEP] By the waterfront is the Customs House Plaza, with the Maritime Museum, as well as the Old Custom House (1827), where the American flag was raised by Commodore John Sloat in 1846 when he claimed Monterey for the United States. [SEP] Beside the Plaza is Monterey’s Fisherman’s Wharf. [SEP] Like San Francisco’s, it is a collection of souvenir shops and restaurants on the dock, offering a great view across the boats in the marina. [SEP] The fish on sale is most definitely fresh, but alas, no longer abundant enough to keep Cannery Row	going	as more than a weather-beaten curiosity. [SEP] The famous sardine fisheries finally closed down in the 1940s as a result of over-fishing, but the waterfront district of timbered canneries, immortalized by the novelist John Steinbeck as “a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia,” has found a new lease on life today as a tourist attraction with souvenir shops, delightful cozy boutiques, and artists’ studios. [SEP] One old cannery building has been splendidly converted to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, one of the premier aquariums in the world as well as an educational showcase for the unique underwater environment of Monterey Bay. [SEP] The centerpiece is the stunning 30-ft- (10-m-) deep Kelp Forest Tank, a window on California’s most important marine hab	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
nada’s full autonomy in home and foreign affairs. [SEP] The governor general in Ottawa became the symbolic representative of the Crown rather than of the British government. [SEP] But the provinces insisted that the Constitution remain with London rather than let Ottawa infringe on their prerogatives. [SEP] At the same time, the country came more and more into the American economic and cultural orbit. [SEP] The boom years of the 1920s saw the growth of a “branch-plant economy;” with American automobile, rubber, chemical, and clothing factories springing up around the Great Lakes at Hamilton, Oshawa, Windsor, and Montréal. [SEP] The boom in American popular culture inundated Canada with radio, movies, and mass-market magazines. [SEP] Québec, in particular, tried to resist the invasion, even	going	so far as to ban adolescents from cinemas. [SEP] Apart from the Group of Seven, a spirited band of Ontario painters who were seeking a distinctive “national” style, most Canadian-born artists — actors, musicians, and writers — felt obliged to seek fame and fortune in New York, London, or Paris. [SEP] Canada’s Great Depression was felt first by farmers in the Prairie Provinces, unable to get rid of their surplus from the wheat glut of 1928. [SEP] Even the drought in 1929 did not ease matters, and ten more years of bad harvests meant they would not recoup their losses. [SEP] Other sectors of the economy — timber, fisheries, mining, and construction — ground to a halt as production outstripped demand.

e same time, these ancestors of the Inuit moved out of their skin tents into warmer igloos of hardened snow blocks. [SEP] They glided over the ice on skates of ivory or antler horn. [SEP] From the Yukon, further migrations took them north to the High Arctic, south around Hudson Bay to Manitoba, east to Greenland, and down the Labrador coast to Newfoundland. [SEP] For the West Coast peoples, as the song says, the living was easy. [SEP] The fish were indeed jumping; bountiful salmon were barbecued in the summertime, smoked for the winter. [SEP] Prehistoric techniques for fishing and trapping have continued right into modern times, though bone has been replaced by steel in the weapons. [SEP] One of British Columbia’s favorite freshwater fishing sites, at Hell’s Gate in Fraser Canyon, has been	going	strong for 9,000 years. [SEP] Prairie Indians hunted buffalo by forcing the herds onto marshland, snowbanks, thin ice, or over cliffs — one of these nasty surprises being known to this day as the Head-Smashed-In buffalo jump, near Fort MacLeod, Alberta. [SEP] Already in 3000 b.c. these people were drying and smoking strips of meat — modern beef jerky. [SEP] In Ontario and Québec, where encroaching forests gradually dispersed the herds of caribou, the Iroquois ousted the Algonquin and settled down to cultivate maize, beans, and squash, living in rectangular, multifamily longhouses.

EP] Farther to the north, mosquitoes can be a problem in summer. [SEP] Connoisseurs of the forests of Québec and the Maritimes favor the spectacular autumn from September to mid-October. [SEP] While the West Coast is mild in May and June, in central and eastern Canada you’ll still find snow on the ground in May and a nip in the air into the month of June. [SEP] The period from November to April is strictly for winter sports enthusiasts. [SEP] Remember the old adage: There’s no bad weather, only bad clothing. [SEP] In addition to your light summer wear, be sure to bring a sweater for the occasional chilly evenings. [SEP] Rather than weighing down your luggage with anything cumbersome, take a leaf out of the Canadians’ book and keep warm by wearing several layers. [SEP] If you’re thinking of	going	north, consider long underwear. [SEP] In any case, don’t forget a raincoat, especially for British Columbia.

You might face severe punishment from those very proud Torontonians if you don’t begin your waterfront tour with a trip up the CN Tower. [SEP] This handsome, outsize TV antenna makes up for its unimaginative name (from its builder, the Canadian National railway and telecommunications company) with all the fanciful interpretations of its shape: jousting lance, hypodermic needle, serpent frozen rigid while swallowing a football. [SEP] At 605 m (1,815 ft), it is currently the world’s highest freestanding structure, 19 m (56 ft) more than a similar monster in Moscow. [SEP] A plexiglass elevator whizzes you up the outside of the tower to two observation decks in the Skypod. [SEP] The ride is free for those	going	to the revolving restaurant or nightclub (which also rank as the world’s highest, if you don’t count a couple in the Rockies, Alps, and Himalayas). [SEP] The view at the top reveals a whole history of Toronto in the contrast between the glass-and-steel skyscraper canyons of the financial district, the geometric dome and cantilevered structures of the Ontario Place leisure complex, and the old-fashioned gabled houses of the neighborhoods. [SEP] Take a second elevator to the Space Deck, to get the full sweep of Lake Ontario’s so-called “Golden Horseshoe.” [SEP] Including Toronto, this dense urban belt from Oshawa in the east to Hamilton and St. Catharines in the west houses half the total population of the province.

[SEP] The European collection of paintings includes important works by Tintoretto, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Rubens, Frans Hals, Jan van Goyen, and Poussin. [SEP] An Ontario collection gives a prominent place to British painters, including Hogarth, Raeburn, Reynolds, and Gainsborough. [SEP] Among the Impressionists and their followers represented here are Renoir, Pissarro, Monet, Cézanne, and Van Gogh. [SEP] “Moderns” include Matisse, Picasso, and Braque. [SEP] The Canadian collection provides a comprehensive survey of 200 years of Canadian painting, pride of place	going	to Emily Carr, Tom Thomson, and members of the influential Group of Seven. [SEP] Two museums on the city outskirts are well worth the trip. [SEP] The marvelously entertaining Ontario Science Centre stands 11 km (6 miles) northeast of the city center (770 Don Mills Rd.). [SEP] Here, adults and children are expected to participate, and they do so enthusiastically in what turns into a sophisticated push-button play center, focused as much on the future as the past and present —  proving that science can be fun.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
Fiestas The Spanish colonists carried on the traditions of their mother country, and to this day there are yearly fiestas in most major towns. [SEP] Many mark Saint’s days or founding days, and the whole population will dress up and enjoy lots of singing and dancing. [SEP] Most have a religious procession to start the proceedings. [SEP] The major fiestas are listed in the Calendar of Events (see page 92), but ask the tourist information office about what’s	going	on during your stay. [SEP] The city of Mérida seems to be in the throes of a constant fiesta, hosting live cultural shows at sites around the downtown area. [SEP] Here you will find the most authentic cultural displays in the region. [SEP] The program changes nightly from ballet to traditional Yucatecan folk music and dances, and all the performances are free. [SEP] There are special performances on the famed Mérida Domingos (Mérida Sundays), lasting all day but for a short break in the heat of the afternoon, and coinciding with a huge market.

[SEP] Less than three years later, an army uprising took place in Wuhan and quickly won widespread support. [SEP] The success of the revolution surprised many observers. [SEP] It came so suddenly that Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the inveterate revolutionary who had led several earlier insurrections, was still abroad at the time.

East from Ágios Nikólaos Heading east from Ágios Nikólaos the road along the northern coast is in the long process of being updated. [SEP] Follow the gulf south to Istro where there are a cluster of hotels, and then on along the coastal plain to one of the major ancient sites in the east — Gourniá, 18 km (11 miles) south of Ágios Nikólaos. [SEP] Myriad stone walls — foundations for multi-storied homes — linked by cobbled streets blanket the hillside site of Gourniá. [SEP] Here more than any other site it is possible to envision ordinary Minoans	going	about their business. [SEP] You’ll be able to explore the marketplace and workshops of the artisans. [SEP] The palace sat at the top of the hill, its west court housing sacrificial slab and magazines for storage of ritual liquids and libations as seen in other Minoan palaces. [SEP] Gourniá was a large city, stretching down to the coast where it had an important port. [SEP] Much remains to be discovered under the low scrub and rocks though there seems little intent to do so. [SEP] The best overview of Gourniá — excavated by American Harriet Boyd Hawkes in the early 1900s — is from the main road as it rises beyond the archaeological site.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2

Live Music Performances Cubans crave live music, and — with the surge in international popularity of traditional Cuban music — so do most visitors to Cuba. [SEP] You certainly won’t have to go out of your way to hear music performances. [SEP] Roving groups of musicians can be found playing everywhere from airports to restaurants. [SEP] Merely wandering the streets of Havana, Santiago, or Trinidad, you’re likely to stumble across a party with a live band, or even a back alley where some impromptu jamming is	going	on. [SEP] On Saturday nights in Camagüey, the music spreads to the streets in a “Noche Camagüeya” block party along Calle República. [SEP] All the styles of Cuba’s delectable traditional music �� habaneras, son, boleros, guarachas, guajiras, and more — can be heard in every town’s casa de la trova, usually a fine old building on or near the main square. [SEP] Performances are amateur and professional, take place afternoons and evenings, and are free or have a minimal cover charge (US$1–$2). [SEP] Especially in the evenings and on weekends, when you’ll encounter a vibrant mix of Cubans and foreigners, the island’s casas de la trova really swing.

That Baracoa was the first settlement to be established by Diego Velázquez in 1511 — making it the oldest colonial city in the Americas — is not in doubt. [SEP] However, locals also claim that Columbus first landed at this spot (rather than near Gibara, north and west of here, as most historians believe). [SEP] They insist that Columbus planted the Cruz de la Parra (Cross of the Vine) in the soil on his arrival. [SEP] The cross is on display in Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, the church on Plaza Independencia. [SEP] (Whatever the truth of the matter, carbon dating has established that the cross is more than 500 years old.) [SEP] Baracoa, though, has so much	going	for it that any associations with Columbus are a bonus. [SEP] A good place to get your bearings is the hilltop Hotel El Castillo, a former castle looking out over old red-tiled roofs, the town’s oyster-shaped bay, and the landmark mountain known as “El Yunque” (“The Anvil”), so named on account of its singular shape. [SEP] On Calle Antonio Maceo, you’ll find people queuing for hot chocolate drinks in the baking tropical sun at Casa del Chocolate. [SEP] Opposite is a charming Casa de la Trova, with rooftop performances.

Modern Times When India became independent in 1947, pressure for change mounted within Nepal. [SEP] In 1950, King Tribhuvan pretended he was	going	on a shooting picnic and managed to escape to India.

[SEP] King Tribhuvan returned, a first constitution for the monarchy was installed, and some foreigners were allowed into Nepal. [SEP] Two years later, Mount Everest was conquered. [SEP] King Mahendra acceded to the throne on the death of his father Tribhuvan in 1955. [SEP] After an experiment with elections and parliamentary democracy, King Mahendra abolished the constitution in 1962 and instituted the system of “panchayat democracy.” [SEP] Road-building and airport construction progressed during his reign.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2

[SEP] Alternatively, you can hire a guide and/or porter and do a lodge-to-lodge trek, which involves very little planning and allows you to do your hiking with only a light day-pack on your back. [SEP] The last — and cheapest — alternative is to carry your own pack and strike out with a good trekking guidebook but no Nepali guide or porter. [SEP] Most people who opt for this latter type of trek stay in the numerous and increasingly more comfortable trailside lodges that can be found on the major trekking routes. [SEP] By staying in lodges, you avoid having to carry a tent, food, or cooking gear. [SEP] A luxury trek in the first category might cost $100 or more per day per person. [SEP] Hiring a guide and porter will lower your daily costs to somewhere around $20 or $25, while	going	it alone (meaning without a guide, as trekking without any companion should not be attempted) can be done for less than $10 a day. [SEP] October and November are the most popular trekking months because they are warm and sunny, and the trails are dry after the monsoon. [SEP] December is good for low-level treks, though it will be getting cold at higher altitudes. [SEP] The winter months bring the clearest skies. [SEP] Spring comes in March and April, when rhododendrons and other flowers set the forests ablaze with color. [SEP] In spring the skies gradually become hazy and there are light rains, which can make flights to starting points unpredictable. [SEP] By May it is hot in Pokhara, the high peaks are rarely visible, and humidity mounts until the weather breaks in June, with the onset of 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
On the Trail Trekking isn’t mountain climbing, but it also isn’t just a stroll in the park. [SEP] It’s walking, with lots of uphills and downhills. [SEP] Almost anyone can go trekking, though a trek is definitely more enjoyable if you’re reasonably fit. [SEP] Sure there are lots of athletes on the trail who seem to be here merely for the challenge, but you’ll also come across groups of the less physically fit, including school groups from the international school in Kathmandu and organized senior citizens’ treks,	going	happily along at their own pace. [SEP] As you hike, whether with a fully loaded backpack or just a light daypack, you can’t help marveling at the burdens that porters carry in their dokos (baskets). [SEP] Everything not made or grown in the villages has to he packed in on the backs of wiry, barefoot porters, who carry loads of as much as 60 kg (130 pounds). [SEP] Even more amazing is the fact that these baskets have no shoulder straps but only tump lines (forehead straps).

Trekking Tips Good hiking boots are the most important equipment for trekkers. [SEP] Although some people trek in running shoes and even flip-flops (and Nepali porters go barefoot), it is advisable to wear sturdy hiking boots with lug soles and especially solid ankle support. [SEP] A second pair of athletic shoes or river sandals can be packed for changing into at day’s end. [SEP] A light pair of sock liners covered by heavier woolen socks or a pair of high-tech sweat-wicking sports socks make for comfort	going	up- and downhill. [SEP] Be sure to have a roll of moleskin or adhesive plaster to put on your heels or other friction spots before blisters form, and to make a cushioned pad around any blister. [SEP] Tight pants, such as blue jeans, can make for very uncomfortable climbing. [SEP] Looser pants, shorts, or, for women, a calf-length loose skirt (such skirts are widely sold in Kathmandu and Pokhara) are recommended. [SEP] You’ll also need extra socks (keep a dry pair separate for putting on at the end of the day), a couple of changes of pants and shirts, a wool sweater or synthetic fleece jacket, and a down jacket. [SEP] Take a flashlight (torch), binoculars, sun hat and sunscreen, sunglasses, water bottle, and pocket knife. [SEP] In your backpack carry a first-aid kit with disinfectant, gauze 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
There are few telephones or radios from which messages may be sent in the mountains or where medical help can be found. [SEP] Find out where these may be on your route. [SEP] Helicopters may be chartered from various companies in Kathmandu at the princely sum of about $2000 for a few hours, payable in advance. [SEP] It can take as much as 24 hours, including time for the message to get through, for a rescue to be arranged. [SEP] Porters can also carry a sick or injured person. [SEP] Register with your embassy and let them know where you’re	going	and when, and do not trek alone; find a companion through a trekking agency or by posting a notice on one of the many bulletin boards in Thamel.

Entertainment For comprehensive listing of what’s	going	on in Paris while you are there, buy one of the weekly guides, Pariscope (with an English-language supplement) or L’Officiel des Spectacles. [SEP] The cinema is a great national passion, with over 300 different films showing in Paris every week. [SEP] For undubbed versions with French subtitles, look out for the letters VO (version originale) in listings or posters. [SEP] Cinemas on the Champs-Elysées, in Montparnasse, St-Germain-des-Prés, Bastille, and the Forum des Halles all show VO movies.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
Poland is not an obvious place to take children, perhaps, and in fact few foreigners who haven’t been posted overseas in Poland seem to do it. [SEP] Traveling with children in Poland is a matter of being flexible, creative, and putting together disparate activities to keep the kids interested when palaces, castles, and rebuilt old towns impress them less than they do their parents. [SEP] Many of the activities listed below are in the capital, Warsaw, where there is simply a greater abundance of facilities. [SEP] To begin with the most obvious option, the Warsaw Zoo (ul. Ratuszowa 1-3, Tel. 619 40 41, <www.warszawa.um .gov.pl./zoo>) has been	going	strong since 1928. [SEP] The habitats of some 4000 animals, including Siberian tigers, kangaroos, cheetahs, crocs, snow leopards, and an unusual red panda are spread across 40 hectares (99 acres). [SEP] The zoo also has a free-flight bird hall. [SEP] Another option in the capital for small children is the Baj Puppet Theater (ul. Jagiellonska 28, Tel. 818 08 21) housed in a former Jewish school in Praga, across the river from Old Town. [SEP] Playgrounds — the kind with tunnels, jungle gyms, and inflatable cages filled with rubber balls — are found in the capital: Stratosfera (ul. Ostrobramska 75c, Tel. 611 35 83); Kolorado Ursynów (ul. Herbsta 4, Tel. 664 88 77). [SEP] For kids with energy to burn, there are water parks and swimming pools (see above) in summer and ice rinks in winter.

gy improved, longer Atlantic journeys became a serious prospect. [SEP] Peace with Spain in 1411 prompted Portugal to seek overseas conquests. [SEP] Prince Henry retired to what was known as the “end-of-the-world,” the Sagres peninsula in the Algarve (see page 101). [SEP] There he established a school of navigation that attracted astronomers, cartographers, and other leading scientists of the day. [SEP] Henry established expeditions that ultimately succeeded in redefining Europeans’ very understanding of the world. [SEP] During Henry’s lifetime, Portuguese caravels sailed far beyond the westernmost point of Africa. [SEP] With the colonization of Madeira and the Azores, the foundations were laid for the future Portuguese empire. [SEP] The Portuguese also sailed down the west coast of Africa,	going	beyond Cape Bojador in 1434, a feat theretofore considered to be impossible. [SEP] Henry died in 1460, but Portugal’s discovery voyages continued. [SEP] The king who ruled over the golden age of exploration — and exploitation — was Manuel I “The Fortunate,” who reigned from 1495–1521. [SEP] The many important discoveries that were made during his reign would assure his position as Europe’s richest ruler: He could well afford to erect monuments as elegant as the Tower of Belém and as impressive as the Jerónimos Monastery in Lisbon.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
Music Music is the ingredient that keeps this island moving, and, whatever their age, Puerto Ricans cannot help but dance to any beat they hear. [SEP] The popular rhythms are a unique mixture of Spanish and African influences, though the instruments traditionally used have antecedents	going	back further than the Spanish colonial and African slave imports. [SEP] The güiro, a percussion instrument made of a notched dried gourd, was developed by the Taíno Indians. [SEP] To this the Spanish added several types of guitars, with the ten-stringed cuatro being the most famous — it is the national instrument of Puerto Rico. [SEP] African slaves brought with them the wherewithal to produce tambours, wood covered in animal skin to create drums, and maracas, dried gourds filled with seeds. [SEP] These instruments played together form the basic “orchestra” for several popular musical genres. [SEP] Puerto Rican folk music is rich with songs based on real-life issues faced by the jíbaros, the ordinary country folk of the island — death, unrequited love, and poverty resulting from bad harvest	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
For “big-name” entertainment, your best bet may be an all-inclusive dinner-show-dancing ticket. [SEP] Resident singers and comedians perform and a dance troupe struts its stuff before you take to the dance floor yourself. [SEP] During the high (winter) season and on any weekend, you must reserve seats for a show or a popular restaurant. [SEP] The biggest night-on-the-town is “social Friday” (which begins after work on Friday evening and doesn’t end until breakfast time Saturday). [SEP] If you’re	going	anywhere in San Juan by car on Friday night, allow at least a half-hour extra to negotiate the traffic.

EP] Eventually, the tarmac stops and the road changes to a simple dirt track. [SEP] The surface is reasonable, so don’t worry about continuing on. [SEP] You’ll travel over a narrow bridge and enter a section of the Bosque Estatal de Boquerón. [SEP] Leave you car below the lighthouse and walk up the hill to reach it (a five-minute walk for the reasonably fit). [SEP] Turn around as you climb the hill, and a wonderful sandy bay will open out in front of you. [SEP] Pelicans play and feed, and frigate birds wheel in the sky above. [SEP] The Faro de Cabo Rojo (Cabo Rojo Lighthouse) has been sadly neglected, but the light still plays an important part in protecting shipping off the island. [SEP] It sits atop some of the highest cliffs on Puerto Rico, a truly spectacular sight. [SEP] But beware of	going	too close to the edge, as there are no fences here. [SEP] Inland from La Parguera and Boquerón is pretty San Germán, once also set on the coast but moved inland after the original site was sacked several times. [SEP] Built on an undulating hillside, the town is the epitome of the Spanish colonial style. [SEP] Its two town squares have not yet been spoiled by neon fast-food signs. [SEP] There’s much of architectural interest around the pretty promenades and grand houses. [SEP] Over 200 named buildings are under protection, but unfortunately, as yet, there is no tourist information office in the town, and many of the buildings are neither identified nor open to the public. [SEP] Just enjoy the beautiful views and stroll along the streets to take in all the detail.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	2
You’ll find a more traditional nightlife, consisting of a weekly “dance” that takes place in an outdoor stadium or on a makeshift dance floor in smaller coastal towns such as Yelapa, Cruz de Loreto, and Barra de Navidad. [SEP] Banda or ranchero-style music tends to dominate, but anything from hip-hop to classic rock may be tossed in for good measure. [SEP] Manzanillo, Ixtapa, and Zihuatanejo offer less in the way of nightlife. [SEP] Manzanillo’s clubs are few, but crowded, and feature recorded music for dancing. [SEP] The Latin music clubs get	going	around 10pm, and don’t even show up before midnight at the techno and alternative clubs. [SEP] The majority of clubs, and the ubiquitous Carlos ‘n’ Charlie’s, are located along the main boulevard, Miguel de la Madrid. [SEP] In Ixtapa, sunset happy hours offer the most options, and Mexican fiestas seem to be a “best bet” for a complete evening. [SEP] Other later night offerings are a sampling of what you’ll find in any resort town in Mexico: Christine’s disco at the Krystal Hotel, Sr. [SEP] Frogs, and Carlos ‘n’ Charlie’s. [SEP] The only really original option here is the club, La Valentina, a combination restaurant/video bar with a desert-inspired décor. [SEP] There is no doubt that Acapulco rules when it comes to nightlife.
