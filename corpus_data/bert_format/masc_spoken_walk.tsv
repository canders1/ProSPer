rous ways. [SEP] First, as a teacher, professionally, I feel that teachers in general are harmed, myself, as well, because there's a dichotomy here in what they're saying about this statement that they have passed on intelligent design as they're not teaching it. [SEP] On the other hand, they've said that it enhances state standards and critical thinking. [SEP] In my mind, everything that you do in a classroom is teaching. [SEP] And I don't necessarily think that's just in my mind. [SEP] I believe that's true of all educators. [SEP] The way I dress when I go to work tells my students something. [SEP] The statements I make or the statements that I do not make in my classroom tell my students something. [SEP] So I think we're charged with, you know, having an ethical decision to make when we	walk	into the classroom, the things that we say and the things that we do, and so I think that's very important. [SEP] But you can't say when you	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	walk	spoken	masc_spoken	1

yeah that's true living in an apartment complex though you know you can't um you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know	walk	around so usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there's people coming around you know and they're trying to sell something or or they're from a religious organization and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago	#telephone#	telephone_sw2015-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	masc_spoken	1
ide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. [SEP] Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus. [SEP] It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role. [SEP] Let me comment on that. [SEP] I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be. [SEP] We can help. [SEP] And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government. [SEP] I want to empower the people. [SEP] I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. [SEP] I just don't think it's the role of the United States to	walk	into a country and say, we do it this way, so should you. [SEP] I think we can help. [SEP] I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. [SEP] But take Russia, for example. [SEP] We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. [SEP] The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. [SEP] They're going to have to make the decision themselves. [SEP] Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. [SEP] But Russia has to make the decision. [SEP] We 	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	walk	written	masc_spoken	1
Back to the question about the differences on gun control. [SEP] What are they, Governor, from your point of view, between you and the Vice President? [SEP] Well, I'm not for photo licensing. [SEP] Let me say something about Columbine. [SEP] Listen, we've got gun laws. [SEP] He says we ought to have gun-free schools. [SEP] Everybody believes that. [SEP] I'm sure every state in the union has got them. [SEP] You can't carry a gun into a school. [SEP] And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school. [SEP] But Columbine spoke to a larger issue. [SEP] It's really a matter of culture. [SEP] It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.

Five hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget. [SEP] Now, that's not in my gut. [SEP] That's not in my value system, and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can	walk	away with another tax cut. [SEP] $89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs.

I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, "See the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. " Because of the president's decision today, law enforcement officers will	walk	into a place that will be more dangerous. [SEP] Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today. [SEP] And that's what Osama bin Laden's handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan. [SEP] It encouraged them to do it.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	walk	written	masc_spoken	1
