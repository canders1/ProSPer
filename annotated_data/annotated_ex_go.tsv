Bradshaw was out with his metal detector when he made the find of a life time -- a gold cup from around 1600 B.C. Bradshaw telephoned a local archaeologist, who was at first skeptical but quickly changed his mind when he saw a photograph of the object. The discovery alerted authorities to an ancient mound that had been flattened by millennia of plowing, and which was subsequently excavated by the Canterbury Archaeological Trust. Bradshaw, under Britain's 1996 Treasure Act, looks set to share the cup's estimated $350,000 value with the landowner on whose property it was discovered, the cup itself	going	to the British Museum.
