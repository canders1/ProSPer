Do you recall a young man by the name of Max Pell speaking at that meeting? [SEP] Unfortunately I was in the restroom at the time that Max Pell was speaking because -- my husband told you I was eight months pregnant. I was actually nine months pregnant and due any day, so I spent quite a deal of time in the restroom. But I had excused myself to go to the restroom just after Barrie did this whole thing. In fact, I may have been	walking	out of the room at the time and in close proximity to her. And so at the time when Max was speaking -- I believe that there were people who spoke in between she and Max Pell. [SEP] But at the time when he stood to speak, I was in the restroom and sort of coming back from the restroom, so I don't really recall exactly what his comments were. [SEP] I know him because he was my husband's student, though. [SEP] Do you recall any other board members saying anything during the course of any discussion about the biology textbook?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	walk	spoken	masc_spoken	2
You never checked? [SEP] There were a couple instances where friends of mine had tried to check on the status of the books in the library but were not permitted to go in at that time. [SEP] So I am only assuming that those books are there now because I am being told that they are. [SEP] But as for myself	walking	into a library and seeing them there, I did not. [SEP] Do you have any objection to these additional books being placed in the library?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	walk	spoken	masc_spoken	2
