Sentence: Robe’s collection of New Mexico legends contains thirty-four variants of the devil-at-the-dance tale. Although the legends in this collection are from rural northern New Mexico, collected in the 1950s and 1960s, we find contemporary versions of the devil-at-the-dance tales in south Texas and in Baja California from the 1980s. Limón and Herrera-Sobek discuss versions of the tale circulating in nightclubs and discotheques among urbanized young people.<n>Of course, not everyone believes such stories. Martin’s book contains a story by a man born in 1904, who says his friend played a trick on his community in Tucson by coming to a dance dressed in black, with a fake rooster foot. Eventually someone noticed his foot and yelled, “The Devil! The Devil!” The narrator says he was there when his friend played the trick, so he doesn’t believe in the legend (50).<n>References De Leon 1982; Glazer 1984,1994; Herrera-Sobek 1988; Limón 1994; Martin 1983; Robe 1951; Robe ed. 1980; West 1988<n>

Sentence: nd small, in the immediate vicinity of Hanuman Dhoka Palace. The palace, which now serves primarily as a museum, takes its name from the red-cloaked figure of the monkey god Hanuman that stands to the left of the main palace entrance. This stone statue was erected in 1672 and stands atop a squat pillar. The statue’s face is entirely obscured by red paste that is smeared on by worshippers. Tour guides say the red paste is to spare Hanuman the sight of the goings-on — more acrobatic than erotic — carved on the struts of the small Jaganath Temple opposite.<n>When this bit of mythology is related, it immediately sends tour groups trotting across to see what is forbidden to the monkey god. Some say the carvings are there for protection, because the goddess of lightning is a virgin who would not come near anything so shocking. The erotica is probably best explained, however, along with Nepal’s ubiquitous Shiva lingams (phalluses) and the female yoni symbols, as an expression of the creative energy in male-female relations and the pleasure principles of Tantrism.<n>In the palace wall beyond the Hanuman statue and protected by a wooden fence is a poem etched in stone in 15 languages dated 14 January 1664. It is attributed to King Pratap Malla, reputed to be a great linguist.<n>
