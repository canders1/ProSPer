She had been counting on that summer between college and law school. [SEP] First of all, she was going to defeat Richard Nixon. [SEP] Then, in her spare time, she would read The Magic Mountain, listen to Corelli's concerti grossi, visit every museum in Manhattan, and, in short, get the liberal education she would have gotten at Cornell had she not been protesting the war, challenging racism, and cooking pasta for radicals. [SEP] Admittedly, in the back of her mind, she also knew that she would drive by Jazz Taylor's house a few times a day. [SEP] Not that she was obsessed anymore, but the memory of him--- his well-muscled thighs, the sunlight on his hair, his niceness---? [SEP] remained, her valentine, her most romantic memory.

There's nothing in the world I love more, not even a third as much. [SEP] Me and Mark. [SEP] I wanted to fall asleep there, for maybe three hundred hours, and dream that I was the object of Mark's fancy. [SEP] There is no way for him to escape me. [SEP] I have thought that I have seen him. [SEP] At a train station, buying a magazine, but I couldn't stop to look or I would have missed my train. [SEP] Once, two years ago, walking back from my high school, I thought I saw him	drive	by me in a pickup truck. [SEP] The truck stopped at a light, I looked right at the driver. [SEP] He looked at me and then he looked back at the steering wheel. [SEP] I continued to look at him. [SEP] He drove off, away from me.	natural	COCA; 2016; Madison Vol. 59, Iss. 2,  (Spring 2016): 77-85,172; Fluffy the Cat; Nelson, Ingrid; FIC: Literary Review	drive	natural	natural	1	think	theme	by me
