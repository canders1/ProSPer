Dear David Hardy,<n>It is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been going on in the United States since the release of his last documentary. In a time of simple-minded patriotism, loud, clear and dissenting voices like Mr. Moore's are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced, partially through well funded public relations campaigns, partially through conservative "grass-roots" propaganda. Not surprisingly, much of the criticism of Moore's film is misguided or outright wrong, often vastly more inaccurate than Moore's work itself.<n>Moore portrays the NRA as an unethical, dishonest organization; he sees the paranoia and fear in the United States as a primary cause of violence, and he does not see gun ownership itself as a problem. His documentary is full of subtle humor, jaw-dropping dialogue and dark contrasts. All in all, it is an accurate portrayal of America's gun and violence culture. It also raises questions about America's foreign policy of recent decades, questions which have been all but ignored by Moore's critics.<n>	#essays#	essays_A_defense_of_Michael_Moore.txt

Sequels: 45734<n>“I trust you had a safe flight, dismal as the airline was?” I nodded. “How can you tell that?” “I could tell the moment you walked in. Not only was the dust on your shoes suggestive, but you smell faintly of jet fuel & inferior peanuts. That, & your boarding pass is sticking out of your pocket with the airline’s name facing out.” I laughed. “Was it really that easy?” “Of course.” “Can you tell anything else?” She studied me intently once more. I’d have to get used to that. “Well, you’ve been well off; have been walking a great deal as of late; are a frequent writer and are a lefty. That’s all I can tell.” I nearly fell out of my chair. “How...?” “Not many ‘lower’ people, including myself, going around wearing a Rolex like that. I could see your shoes have been worn a few milimeters, but the canvas is fairly new. As far as the writing goes, you’ve a considerable amout of ink & graphite on the side of your left hand.” “You’re a genius!” I cried.

“Hey.” A girl, sixteen years old, with masses of bright red hair and big gray eyes opened the door. She snapped her gum, leaning comfortably against the doorway. Loud music sounded from inside.<n>“Hey, Beth.” I walked up the pathway and into Beth’s mansion of a house, pulling at my camisole nervously. Was I ever going to get over being around her? I held in a sigh. Probably not.<n>“Everyone’s downstairs. Get yourself a beer.” Beth pointed down the stairs, to where the music was blasting from. I strode over to the opening. I looked back over my shoulder, seeing if she was coming, but Beth was already on the couch, absorbed with a cute junior. I sighed, out loud this time. She didn’t notice.<n>	#ficlets#	ficlets_1399.txt
I couldn’t see anything, I was awaiting the pit of my stomach to return. Everything happened so fast. Lining up angry wasps would’ve been easier.<n>I had no idea what was in store for me.

I got older and went to school, then to college, and I replaced the dreams my Nana gave me with the music DJs mixed for crowds in clubs, webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything. My girlfriend Rachel and I would go to the clubs near our school. Sometimes we'd get word that people were gathering under one of the bridges, and we'd rush down to hit it before the cops broke it up. Boston is a strange place at night. You wouldn't believe half of the shit I've seen, even when I was straight.<n>It was a Friday night. Rachel and I went out to dinner, and when we finished, she saw that there was a message on her cell phone. She checked it there in the restaurant. Her head tilted into the phone as she listened, her pleather purse on her lap, shining jet against the worn black of her snug Dead Can Dance T-shirt. “It’s from Mitch,” she said, folding up the phone. “He says we should meet him tonight, there’s a good one going on in that church that closed down last month.”<n>“I don’t know … it was going to be just us tonight. I’m not sure I’m up for a night out.” I was feeling calm and private that night.

It’s been over a week, and I want to dance. Let’s go together, you know you’ll have fun once you get into it.” She bit the inside of her bottom lip, looking at me like I was breaking her poor, sweet heart. I’m a sucker for that, and she knows it.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
My driver took a deep breath. As he did, his neck stretched in a strange way and I noticed several thin lines, like wrinkles, running across the sides of his neck. “Nathan,” he began in the way that people speak when they start a long and difficult explanation, “Rachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet. This person, like me, is not a member of traditional society. You see, Nathan, there is …separate from your society …oh, damn it. I’ve never had to give this conversation before. Come on, I have something to show you.” With that, he made a sharp turn onto a side street that I hadn’t noticed before. We drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that I couldn’t tell whether they were abandoned. My driver turned again next to an old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year.<n>In front of a few houses, there were cars parked, but there were almost none on the streets. Their bumpers looked ready to drop off, and their paint was half smog. I got a strange feeling that we weren’t supposed to be driving here. “Hey,” I said, “are you sure that we should be going this way? I mean – ”<n>“Just ignore that,” he told me. “You’ll be used to the sensation in a moment.” That just unnerved me more. As we kept driving, the anxiety grew more pronounced. I noticed that there were some people on the street, people the same color as the soiled buildings. Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes. “Okay, this is the spot,” said my driver, pulling over. He parked and got out.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
Holding Dvorov’s directions, Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway. I started wondering again how reliable my guide’s credentials were. Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other, he did not inspire confidence.<n>“Just at this corner,” he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east. East is that way.” He pointed at the wall to our right. “Don’t let the sun fool you. Then I’m going to shed a little blood, but don’t worry, none of yours.” I blinked at him, but he just kept walking until we reached the corner. “Okay, you might feel silly, but just turn three times to your left. Try to keep in time with me.” We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust. The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back. When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner. Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening the door. “Are you coming?”<n>We slipped through the door and came out, not inside the building, but on a busy street in a completely different part of town. The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East. Nepthys took us immediately to the right, where he led us to a cart filled with herbs. Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn’t place. The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar. Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart, and with its long, many-shouldered pole of a torso, it rose over our heads even while seated. Its face was small and wrinkled, with penny-sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose. “Would the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs?” it asked. “There are no finer to spice a meal, nor purer to mix a potion. Please, let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs.”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
“Oh, thanks, Nepthys, for your confidence-inspiring tales of experience. So they’re probably worse than we think, okay, that’s great. Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an Anne Rice novel?”<n>“My plan is that you shut up while we’re trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what we’re actually going up against. Okay? Don’t forget, she’s your girlfriend. Now calm down while I talk to this gentleman. I can hear your heartbeat from over here.”<n>I shut up and tried to breathe. Nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed, who had not moved. “Please, accept our apologies. As you can see, our situation is of personal importance to the young man. Now: may we ask you a few questions about an individual we believe to be a vampire? It would be a great help to us.”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
We hit a bar on the next street over. “Vodka, straight up,” Nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter, “and a Bloody Mary for my friend. Make it extra bloody.” When our drinks came, he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my Bloody Mary. “That should help,” he said. “You could run on empty with a little of that stuff. It won’t refill your blood supply, but while that’s in your system, you won’t even need blood.” He grinned at me. “Drink up, kid.”<n>I took about half of the Bloody Mary in one gulp and then ate the celery. Nepthys slapped me on the back. “Okay,” I said, “now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s going on here? I mean, what is this place, really?”<n>He thought about that. “I think that our world is a reflection of yours, or yours is a more boring reflection of ours. This place is just a little of both. In America, things are still weird after the European conquest. The natives are still here, but so is everyone else. The Europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities. We aren’t quite what you’d expect from reading the Grimms.”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
“My parents came over from Russia, just like your family. My real name is a little more ethnically appropriate, but we don’t toss those around in this place. They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary. When the Russian government dammed the river, my parents decided that instead of dying with the river, they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected. I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river. Sure, I miss having a place to settle down, but it’s better than waiting to get dammed.” He took another shot of vodka.<n>“Shouldn’t you be going light on the vodka? I mean, we might have a lot of work ahead of us.”<n>“Are you kidding? I can drink like a fish, kid. We should get going, though. Still woozy?” I nodded. “A little walking should get the stuff into your system. Come on, let’s go.”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
We left. Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck. “You idiot,” he hissed, “do you know how much you’ve set us back? I should say, set yourself back, since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for.” I thought about Rachel; in the excitement, I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts. “You’re just lucky that Dvorov isn’t my only contact. Come on, we’re heading out.” He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs. Walking outside, I was shocked to see that it was already dark. “Night comes quickly here,” said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me. “Didn’t I warn you?”<n>“Okay,” he said as we hit the street, “we’re going to see another friend of mine. First, though, we are getting you a hat. You look ridiculous with a shaved head.” At a nearby stand, he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston. It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front. Amy liked it, I think. She still hadn’t spoken since I named her, so I wasn’t sure.<n>He took us to a squat, long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal. The black door opened as we came up to it, and a pale man opened the door. He was naked, but there was nothing to hide: his body was hairless and completely smooth. I only say “he” because he didn’t have a hint of femininity. His eyes were white. From behind him, I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure’s “A Forest”.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
“She may be at that,” said Isis, gazing at her. “That sweet, small nose, and her soft lips – she’d kiss well, I should think, if gently. She has good blood under her cheeks. Good, round breasts, too, even though they’re small, they suit her.” Amy didn’t blush, and I hoped that she didn’t understand what Isis was saying.<n>“She would have been worth it,” Nepthys interrupted, “if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact. He was going to give us valuable information for her.”<n>“Now I understand why you’re here,” said Isis. “So what do you need to know?”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
Nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall. When we got there, another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood. He offered it to Nepthys, who opened the box: on velvet lining, a wooden hammer and two stakes.<n>“Mountain ash,” said Nepthys. “That was very kind of her.” Closing the box, he paused beside the open door and looked back at me. “I really hope we find your Rachel,” he said. It looked like he was going to continue, but then he walked out the door.<n>“I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,” said Nepthys. “I bet he’s kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me.” In a few minutes, we were back to the first door we’d knocked on in this town and Dvorov himself was greeting us. The pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt

Price records are being set at auctions this week. At Christie's, a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz's "Equivalents" series sold for $396,000, a single-lot record. Other works also have been exceeding price estimates. In part, prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints. This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal, says Beth Gates-Warren of Sotheby's. "There is finally some sort of sense in the market," she says.<n>Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers, giving greater market stability, says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector. "When I see prints going into the hands of institutions, I know they aren't going to come back on the market." Most in demand: classic photographs by masters such as Stieglitz and Man Ray. But much contemporary work is also fetching "a great deal of money," says Miles Barth of the International Center of Photography.<n>DIALING 900 brings callers a growing number of services.<n>	#newspaper:newswire#	newspaper:newswire_wsj_0120.txt

By comparison, for the first nine months, Xerox earned $492 million, or $4.55 a share, on revenue of $12.97 billion.<n>	#newspaper:newswire#	newspaper:newswire_wsj_0176.txt
A new continuity<n>What general lessons can be claimed from our two examples? Many would argue that traditional employment systems, going back to the factories of the eighteenth century, do not favour boundaryless careers. We agree, but we also live in a time when those systems are failing, and where their underlying assumptions of stasis are incompatible with the emergent reality of persistent change. Moreover, those systems were designed according to a conception of ‘labour capital’ rather than to one of ‘intellectual capital’. Yet, it is the conception of intellectual capital that is increasingly emphasised today. Readers of this chapter will most likely see themselves as having a capacity for continuous learning. Is it really too great a step to extend the same belief in the capacity for learning to the workforce at large?<n>If the workforce at large can learn, what are the social arrangements that best sustain new learning? Leaving the determination of what is to be learned to a few senior managers? Knowing what is best for people or trusting that they might know, or at least contribute to knowing, what is best for themselves? Having people trapped by deferred rewards (Williamson, 1975), or acknowledging that those rewards systems are grounded in distrust?<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_CUP2.txt
