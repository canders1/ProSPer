Then they went on, they didn't make it to the house.<n>At about, about three weeks later, then arrived a group of about four, at my brother's house, and told him, that they were coming to, to be, that is to take control of the place, where we lived.<n>Well, but that they weren't going to steal, they weren't going to kill, neither would they harm the people, but it we didn't, if we worked with them.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
I said, "No, I'm not going to tell them."<n>So, the next day, I left early in the morning for San Miguel, to see my daughter, and when I was coming back, I went by my brother's, which was a place in, a town called Chapeltique, and I arrived at his place, and I said, his name is Salomon, and I said, "Brother, I am here to see if you'll give me posada (lodging)," we call it, like you give someone a place to live in your own house.<n>And he said, "What's going on?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt

You had the things that they would read out of books, which were purely for entertainment, it always seemed like.<n>Um, and then if it was anything that was, you know, that I kind of correlated with, if it wasn't coming from a book, they were probably trying to get something into my head.<n>You know, trying to like, you know, teach me something in some way.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt
You know, trying to like, you know, teach me something in some way.<n>So it was kind of like if it was coming out of book, I knew it was for pure entertainment, whereas if it was something they were telling to me, I might be a little more receptive to, you know, maybe trying to find a little, a little meaning behind it and say, " Hey, why are you, why are you telling me this?"<n>Now, your grandparents or great-grandparents came from Italy?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt
Um, yeah, I mean they just, they mostly, they didn't really talk about what it was like being over there.<n>I mean, they more talked about, um, coming over here.<n>Like from the time when they came over here that was hard for them at first to adjust.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt
Well I get there this morning and um, I forget how, I think either I asked a question and he came in there or, whatever.<n>Anyhow, he tells me, "Well I need it by today because such and such is coming, coming in and we need to take it to the bank."<n>And I'm like, "Oh."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt

I spoke to him twice that day and it was like.<n>So anyway, um, he ended up coming in there and he was like, "How's it coming along?"<n>And I was like, "I'm almost done."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
And so she sat back down, and, you know, they were still chatting, and they could still see this person, and this person was walking really, really fast.<n>And she said that her brother had this really distinctive walk and she said the more she looked at that person coming down that road she started thinking "No, that can't be, that can't be."<n>And she said, but you know, the closer he got, she said she got up, and she peered down the road and she looked at her mom, and she said, she said, "Mama, you know, I think that's Joe."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt

We kind of had some, uh, not reservation about moving, it was an elective move for us, but certainly, um, living in a different part of the country than we were used to was, uh, something which was a change for us and something that we had thought long about.<n>But coming here, rather than, um, perhaps picking up and focusing on the differences, I think we tried to look at the, uh, you know, just the, um, the, the special points about the, uh, life in the South and, and the people here and the customs and I think it's been something that we've always, uh, valued.<n>Some, some folks, uh, either, uh, from the South don't value the people from the North and vice versa, but I think it's been a real positive thing, our move for us, in many ways.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt
Um-<n>What are some of the differences you noticed when coming down here from, that you mentioned-<n>Differences, well, it's uh,<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt
And it's just amazing how much change there's been, a, a dramatic change there has been just in that one institution alone.<n>Um, and you look at other kinds of things and I think Charlotte, and maybe it's typical of the South, but I think that, uh, maybe there hasn't been as much growth here before and when you have growth and you have people coming in, who, looking for services.<n>And you, and you also have a, a government, um, who are, are really ready to take that challenge as opposed to just deciding that, "Hey, listen we're gonna do things the way we've done it for the last, you know, 100 years, whether new people come or need services or ask for amenities or not, we're going to keep things the way they are."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt
Went in, and, uh, it always, mother had always talked about the staircase and how beautiful it was, and indeed it probably had been.<n>As we walked up the stairs, the window was broken and the shade was flapping in the breeze, and the wallpaper was wet from the rain, and the elements had been coming in for years; as we walked through the home, and I have fond memories of that day, I was probably in the fifth or sixth grade, I would imagine.<n>Um, we went outdoors then, went into the barn, and there was a dead calf in the barn.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt
And it was our first horse that we had, it was, uh, a Christmas present.<n>And I still can picture that with the, uh, the light, the outdoor light of the barn and the snow coming down, it was really, beautiful.<n>But, uh, we lived there, we moved in the spring of `48, and uh, February, around February 10 of 1959, I got a call and the house was on fire.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt
Right.<n>But my brother and I would play basketball in the yard or play baseball, and we used to play a lot of kickball in our yard, because we had a big yard and a lot of kids, so we were always coming up with something.<n>What about, hmm, your daddy?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
Well, they always say that some of the bad things are what stands out and not necessarily a bad thing but it is one of my best memories is, ah.<n>Well my dad was diagnosed with cancer right before baseball season my senior year and it didn't keep him from coming to any of the baseball games though.<n>I can remember him just in, in the months prior, just prior to when he died, it was like it took every ounce of energy he had to show up at the baseball games, but nothing kept him from showing up.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt

And there's always, all of the kids were having a great time while the parents left, and it was like one big, huge flight of fancy and they just go from one thing to another thing and it was like really fun and chaotic and just neat.<n>And then, and then it was always like an adventure though because then all of a sudden, toward the end, like the parents are coming back.<n>And we all know that if we don't have everything cleaned up you're going to get punished.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt
Are they going to make it?"<n>So it's like having a blast and going on a flight of fancy and then coming back to reality and then like not getting caught<n>, kind of.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt
They went to the same church we went to, First Methodist, and they sat on a certain pew and woe be unto the person who sat, that chose to sit on the Lann twins' pew.<n>They watched everybody's coming and going when we, we kids on the street became teenagers.<n>They could tell you who everyone was dating and, if you were a girl, whether or not you got a goodnight kiss under the porch light and probably reported it at every bridge table they sat at for the next several weeks.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt

It's the home of West Virginia Wesleyan College and that was my playground, that was my own, the place where I spent so much of my childhood playtime and, uh, running through the different buildings and structures of the campus.<n>Uh, having a free reign, going and coming as I pleased almost, because my grandfather was the Dean of the College.<n>And, and everybody knew me so nobody really tried uh, to uh corral me, so I was sort of free to go and do what I wanted, you know when the buildings were open.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt
revolutionary proportions, but why do you identify so much with the Jewish plight portrayed in Fiddler on the Roof?<n>Um, well my favorite part was the two staircases, one going up and one coming down, or there were three actually, one going nowhere, in between.<n>Dad, come on, you're making no sense at all.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt
