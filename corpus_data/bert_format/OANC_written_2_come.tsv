—Jeff Kernodle, Vice President for Replenishment, VF Corp Many of the popular accounts of quick response, rapid replenishment, and supply-chain management assume that all parties—consumers, retailers, and suppliers—win as a result of these policies. [SEP] Consumers have definitely benefited because these practices afford them a greater choice of products at lower average prices.1 [SEP] It is safe to say that lean retailers have also	come	out ahead, given their rapid growth in relation to, and at the expense of, traditional retailers in many different retail channels. [SEP] But have suppliers benefited from entering into relations with lean retailers? [SEP] Have such firms improved their competitive position along with the retailers they supply? [SEP] The short answer to these questions is “It depends.” [SEP] Although it is certainly true that a supplier gains from successful customers, the degree to which such a company actually benefits has much to do with its internal manufacturing choices. [SEP] A supplier that has done little to change its internal practices may end up simply “holding the bag” of a retailer’s inventory.

[SEP] Based on our survey research, we found that implementing a combination of the four key practices—bar codes, EDI, advanced shipping systems, and modular assembly—increases business-unit performance because these practices interact with and reinforce one another.

fashion-basic, and basic products. [SEP] Although product variety in apparel has historically been associated with the fashion end of the industry, the number of products available to U.S. consumers in almost every apparel category has grown significantly over the past two decades. [SEP] Consider men’s shirts. [SEP] Throughout much of the post–World War II era, the majority of men’s shirts sold in the United States were white dress shirts. [SEP] But today a shirt manufacturer’s “basic” collection typically includes solid white, blue, and a white/blue weave, as well as white with color stripes in pure cotton, cotton/polyester blends of various mixtures, and other fabrics like 100-percent cotton oxford, pinpoint oxford, and several qualities of broadcloth.12 [SEP] Most of the collection will	come	with a choice of collar styles, and some will include a French cuff option. [SEP] There are also common cuts (“silhouettes”), such as regular, athletic, loose fit, and long. [SEP] In addition to these dimensions, there are quarterly collections of different fabrics. [SEP] Each shirt corresponding to a combination of these characteristics—for example, a 16–35 blue, button-down, pinpoint oxford shirt with French cuffs cut long—has its own pattern of demand that varies considerably over the course of a year.13 [SEP] For a retailer, a larger number of SKUs raises the level of uncertainty regarding what product will sell or not sell in any period. [SEP] In practical terms, this means that a retailer carrying a broader array of goods faces increased costs both for carrying goods in inventory that	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch3.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
 is due in part to the lower demand volumes during those periods relative to the middle of a product’s life, but such fluctuations also occur because of the inherent uncertainty during the ramp up or ramp down of a product’s life. [SEP] Demand variation plays a central role in determining a manufacturer’s finished goods inventory levels. [SEP] In the following case studies, we describe how demand variation can be used to determine a firm’s production and inventory planning processes. [SEP] These cases offer a rational approach to inventory management for manufacturers, one that is premised on receiving accurate POS information from retailers and maintaining good working relationships with all channel players—for example, retail orders are not placed at the last minute and textile suppliers	come	through when they say they will. [SEP] Reality is messier of course: retailers and suppliers often “surprise” manufacturers, and the POS data are rarely perfect or may not even be available. [SEP] Yet these nagging problems do not negate the need for a new approach to inventory management; they merely indicate how complicated supplier relationships have be	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
er’s distribution center. [SEP] Two weeks are spent in the cutting room, where the cloth is spread, cut, inspected, and has backing material fused to appropriate parts of the outer (“shell”) fabric. [SEP] Four weeks are spent in assembly processes. [SEP] The last two weeks involve final inspection, repairs if necessary, shipping to the distribution center, and hanging the finished coats so they can be picked to fill individual orders for a given store. [SEP] A men’s suit coat or a blazer requires more than a hundred assembly operations (compare this with only forty operations for a men’s shirt); it is one of the most complicated and expensive apparel items to make. [SEP] Although the number of operations partly determines how long it takes to get a garment through production, other factors	come	into play, including the firm’s policy about how many finished coats should be allowed to build up in work-in-process and finished goods inventory. [SEP] Given this manufacturer’s policy of ordering production only when inventory levels dropped below ten weeks, with the production quantity set to restore the inventory to fourteen weeks, the minimum production quantity for each item was four weeks of demand. [SEP] Thus, at least four weeks of demand—a large quantity for most products—of the same style and size could move through the sewing plant at one time, minimizing setup costs for thread changes and the like. [SEP] The diagram in Figure 7.5 depicts the production process, including all product and information flows relevant to the inventory decision.

a hundred to three hundred plies of men’s dress-shirt fabric might be cut at one time. [SEP] In contrast, a men’s dress suit might be cut from a single ply, or from five or six plies of the same or different material. [SEP] Spreading the cloth many plies thick without stressing the cloth is, again, one of the quality steps of getting ready to sew. [SEP] If the cloth has tension before it is cut, then it will contract after it is cut into separate pattern pieces. [SEP] Because it is easy to stretch many fabrics by up to an inch in a yard, one can imagine the amount of distortion possible in the final garment. [SEP] But technical innovations have aided the operators. [SEP] Stresses in the cloth on the lay table can be minimized with the help of mechanical spreading machines, and such devices	come	in all sizes and costs. [SEP] The most elaborate allow an operator to ride the machine, which holds the rolls of cloth, so that it can feed the cloth onto the table at a speed that just matches the speed of the machine as it moves along rails fixed to the table. [SEP] On-board computers compare the location of cloth defects with pattern pieces in the marker. [SEP] If the type of defect and its location are deemed unacceptable, then the bolt of cloth is cut and a new ply started with enough overlap to ensure that all pattern pieces are whole and without defects. [SEP] In our sample, business units used some type of automatic spreading for about 39 percent of the volume of goods they shipped. [SEP] Simpler spreading machines have no on-board computer, but they do unroll the bolt of cloth “uns	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
mon with knit goods actually trim the edges of cloth just in front of the needle; in these cases any fused material from the laser cutting could be trimmed away. [SEP] But, if nothing else, the temperature effects on fabric, combined with the cost of installation, appear to limit the use of this technology to those applications in which the connection between plies before sewing could be an advantage. [SEP] The great advantage of laser-cutting is speed. [SEP] Modern laser-cutters, developed both in this country and Japan, leave the laser fixed in position and move the light beam around simply by computer-controlled tilting of the mirrors that guide the beam along the desired path. [SEP] With high-powered lasers, the beam can be moved quickly and still cut through the cloth. [SEP] There may	come	a day when the demand for single-ply cutting and the economics of continuous laser-cutting will allow this technology to be more cost effective. [SEP] Until then, it will not be widely used in the garment trade. [SEP] Bundling the Parts	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
 to say that all the pieces for a custom garment must be kept together during assembly. [SEP] If the sewing room is making garments one at a time, it is probably not using the progressive bundle system. [SEP] Instead, items will be assembled by teams of a few workers, who will do all the assembly operations. [SEP] Such a short-cycle production system adds to the cost of customized apparel. [SEP] You cannot make a completely customized item of apparel with just four measurements. [SEP] The Levi’s process merely adjusts the pattern pieces of a basic style of jeans with these measurements. [SEP] If a customer wants more areas or features customized, many more measurements are necessary. [SEP] Achieving consistent measurements presents a major problem because two trained fitters will generally	come	up with important differences in the body measurements of the same person. [SEP] No matter how the measurements are taken, most people being measured in this way have a difficult time standing up straight and holding in their stomachs. [SEP] The second approach to mass customization attempts to over	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
This machine over	come	s the bobbin thread limitation and can operate at higher speeds, but it does have disadvantages. [SEP] In this case, there is no bobbin. [SEP] Below the sewing surface, the lower thread is manipulated by a mechanical arm called a looper. [SEP] The looper inserts a loop of the bottom thread into a loop of the top thread that is created when the needle pierces through the fabric plies and begins to withdraw from the cloth. [SEP] The top thread is then pulled up by the take-up arm. [SEP] The top thread cannot be pulled through the cloth because it is held below the fabric by the inserted loop of the bottom thread. [SEP] The bottom thread is formed into a continuous sequence of very small loops by the looper arm. [SEP] Although the top and bottom threads are not interlocked, as in the lockstitc	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
These issues aside, there is one other major task a sewing operator performs. [SEP] She must make the pieces of the pattern fit together at the end of the sewing process. [SEP] This is certainly not possible if there has been a big mistake in cutting, but it is never easy, even without serious cutting errors. [SEP] If two plies of flat cloth of identical length are placed on top of each other and sewn together, then the ends of the two pieces will not line up without the intervention of a sewing operator. [SEP] The two ends of a thirty-inch leg seam on a pair of jeans, for instance, might be a quarter of an inch out of alignment unless the operator takes control. [SEP] During sewing, the feed-dog on the machine—a part that	come	s up through two slots in the stitch plate and engages the bottom ply of cloth—will pull the bottom ply under the presser foot and against the pull of the thread. [SEP] The top ply of cloth is carried along by the bottom ply; hence, one ply is stretched more than the other. [SEP] This simple fact of sewing makes it very difficult to automate the process. [SEP] In reality, the two seam lines to be joined are rarely exactly the same length. [SEP] Cutting introduces differences from the top to the bottom of the layers of fabric. [SEP] No matter how good spreaders and cutters are, preassembly operations are never perfect.

In my three decades of teaching university courses in child development, I have	come	to know thousands of students, many of whom were parents or who became parents soon after completing my class. [SEP] I also served on boards of directors and advisory committees for child-care centers, preschools, elementary schools, and parent organizations. [SEP] And my research continually drew me into classrooms, where for countless hours I observed and recorded preschool and school-age children’s activities, social interactions, and solitary behaviors, in hopes of answering central questions about how they learn. [SEP] As a byproduct of those experiences, parents repeatedly approached me with concerns about how to foster their child’s development in the early years. [SEP] Their fervent questions, at times riddled with doubt and anxiety, revealed that creating optimum learning environme	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
would prime them for academic success. [SEP] But research eventually documented otherwise—that regimented tutoring not adjusted to the child’s interests and capabilities undermines rather than enhances learning, motivation, and self-control. [SEP] In preschools and kindergartens where much time is spent sitting, listening to teachers, and doing worksheets, children exhibit high levels of stress behaviors, such as wiggling, withdrawal, and talking out. [SEP] They also show a decline in self-conﬁdence and motivation, expressing doubts about their own ability and retreating from challenging problems. [SEP] Furthermore, when followed up during the ﬁrst few years of school, children who spent their kindergarten year in a highly teacher-directed classroom achieve more poorly than do agemates who	come	from kindergartens emphasizing play and hands-on, small-group projects.28 [SEP] Recall 4-year-old Lydia’s dislike of her academic preschool, described at the beginning of this chapter. [SEP] Lydia’s negative reaction is certainly consistent with research ﬁndings.

As Damon explains, the child-centered philosophy was a major breakthrough when ﬁrst introduced, in that it made parents and teachers aware that children have unique needs and beneﬁt from warmth and encouragement. [SEP] But, Damon contends, modern child-centeredness has been stretched to the point of unrestrained child gratiﬁcation, resulting in a youth culture in which children and adolescents are less engaged, less purposeful, less accomplished academically, and more egoistic and antisocial than in previous generations. [SEP] Damon acknowledges that economic constraints and other family pressures play a part in this youth disaection. [SEP] But he places most blame on how contemporary children are reared. [SEP] Child-centeredness, Damon explains, has be	come	an excuse for a rudderless parenting and educational culture that makes few demands while fostering in children a stress-free, “feel-good” attitude in which children are told, ”You’re lovable,” “You’re great,” “You’re terriﬁc,” regardless of what they do.

Consider the early attachment bond that builds between caregiver and baby during the ﬁrst year of life. [SEP] By age 6 to 8 months, infants single out their parents and other stable, loving caregivers for expressions of joy and turn to them for comfort when anxious and afraid. [SEP] An overwhelming consensus of research shows that sensitive caregiving—responding to the baby’s cries for physical care and stimulation promptly, consistently, and appropriately—supports the development of a secure attachment relationship.7 [SEP] Securely attached infants actively seek contact with and are easily consoled by their familiar, responsive caregiver. [SEP] Yet such infants are not destined to be	come	immaturely dependent! [SEP] Rather, by the end of the ﬁrst year, their exploration of the physical world is conﬁdent, persistent, and complex.

 demonstrates that language development in early childhood is strongly related to later reading competence—and to academic achievement in general during elementary school.89 [SEP] Furthermore, both language progress and an array of emergent-literacy skills can be predicted by the sheer amount of verbal interaction in the home during the ﬁrst few years of life—a relationship that holds for children of all socioeconomic levels. [SEP] Conversations with adults are especially powerful contributors to early childhood language proﬁciency and, in turn, to literacy development.90 [SEP] A strong language foundation is vital for becoming literate because people read to extract meaning. [SEP] Children can more easily derive meaning from the printed page when their vocabularies are large and they have	come	to think in ways that resemble the narrative styles on which the large majority of written texts are based. [SEP] By repeatedly listening to and participating in narrative conversation, children develop mental scripts for the way narratives are typically organized. [SEP] Then, when they start to read, the organization of text material readily makes sense to them, and they extract meaning more easily. [SEP] One of the clearest indicators of young children’s understanding of stories, and other prereading skills, is the extent to which they can give elaborate, detailed accounts of past events.91 [SEP] Children sharpen this competency through conversing with adults, who add information, ask questions, and prompt children to increase the sophistication of their descriptions and explanations—in e	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
sate for what was missing: warm, family time. We almost never sat down to a meal together or went places together; we each went our own way. Our dad started going o on vacations by himself when holidays rolled around, so family get-togethers were rare. “When our parents split up, we moved with our mom from Arkansas to Seattle. Mom worked all week, weekends, and most evenings. She had to get a career going so there’d be money to live on and to send us to college. Sarah hung out with another family in the neighborhood. A couple of times a week, she had dinner and went to church with them. Looking back, I’d say they were her substitute family; she ‘adopted’ them, and they ‘adopted’ her. I was too young to go o on my own that way. When I didn’t have after-school activities, Mom insisted that I	come	home and do chores and homework. Sometimes I got to go to a friend’s house to play, but many nights I’d open a can of spaghetti and have dinner by myself. I spent hours daydreaming and looking at old pictures of Mom, Dad, Sarah, and me.” [SEP] On ﬁnishing high school, Sarah chose a religiously aliated college of the same denomination as that of her “alternative” family. [SEP] The year after her college graduation, Sarah married a devout classmate, entering into a culture in which family life was pivotal. [SEP] Six years later, Hannah started college, but for her the road to maturity was rough. [SEP] She had diculty concentrating, earned uneven grades, and accumulated so many incompletes in courses that the university prohibited her from reenrolling until she wrapped up her “unﬁnished busine	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
he heart of her success story. [SEP] Indeed, Hannah’s tale suggests that young children denied these supports can still proﬁt from them later, if such supports are available and they have the fortitude to capitalize on them. [SEP] But not all young people are as fortunate as Hannah. [SEP] Some remain profoundly impaired by inadequate adult investment in their childhoods. [SEP] And even those who fare reasonably well may carry with them inner wounds—a sense of emptiness and regret at having missed self-deﬁning, conﬁdence-inducing early experiences that cannot, in the ﬁnal analysis, be recaptured. [SEP] Experts asked to reﬂect on the malaise and problematic behavior of children today repeatedly comment that they lack sucient adult guidance and involvement.127 [SEP] We have seen that children	come	into the world marvelously prepared to enter into partnerships with parents and other caregivers. [SEP] In the course of this chapter, I have had much to say about just how parents and teachers can capitalize on children’s natural propensities. [SEP] Vygotsky’s concept of the “zone” clariﬁes for us the meaning of true “quality time.” [SEP] What must we do to keep young children in the “zone,” motivated, involved, and ever advancing to new heights? [SEP] Here is a brief recap of the communicative principles we have considered: •Forge an adult–child relationship based on shared understanding, or intersubjectivity—one in which the adult strives to “connect” with the child by “stretching down” to his or her point of view, thereby helping the child “stretch up” to the adult’s more mature perspec	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
itive emotional tone and providing explanations and justiﬁcations for your expectations. [SEP] When adult–child relationships are sympathetic and caring, children want to acquire skills and behave in ways that preserve those gratifying ties. [SEP] They are also more willing to work toward goals that are rational and reasonable. [SEP] Authoritative parenting, which combines the motivating power of warmth with the guidance inherent in scaolding, predicts many aspects of children’s competence. [SEP] •Engage children in narrative conversation about personal experiences, using an elaborative conversational style that poses many varied questions and that expands on the child’s statements. [SEP] Through narrative, children build an autobiographical self permeated with cultural beliefs and values;	come	to understand that people have rich mental lives and may view the same events dierently; and acquire negotiation strategies for resolving disputes and getting along with others. [SEP] Narrative conversation also fosters language development and emergent literacy, which greatly ease the task of learning to read and write when children get to school. [SEP] Through dialogues with children, adults play a formative role in the development of children’s self-conceptions, sensitivity to others, cognition, academic knowledge, morality, social skills, and capacity to use language to gain control over thought and behavior. [SEP] Can parents and teachers actually witness young children undergoing these social-to-psychological transformations? [SEP] Let’s turn now to a consideration of children’s inner	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
rs during make-believe play. [SEP] They achieve their maximum display of willpower when at their own initiative they renounce a momentary attraction in favor of rule-governed behavior.14 [SEP] The paradox of make-believe is that in everyday life, when children subordinate actions to rules, they usually give up something they want—instead of keeping a treasured toy all to themselves, they share it; instead of continuing to play, they clean up; instead of watching more TV, they go to bed. [SEP] During fantasy play, however, renouncing impulse and following social rules are central to the fun of playing. [SEP] Rather than frustrating or disappointing the child, self-restraint is the route to maximum pleasure. [SEP] In sum, subordinating immediate desires to the rules of make-believe scenes be	come	s a new form of desire15—one that responds to the child’s need to be	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
further development of play—speciﬁcally, for movement toward game play in middle childhood. [SEP] In make-believe, the rules of play are implicit; preschoolers are hardly aware of enacting them. [SEP] Instead, they are caught up in creating imaginary situations—putting a stuffed animal to bed, driving an ambulance to a train crash, or ringing up a customer’s purchase at the cash register. [SEP] Winning and losing, team membership and competition, and purposefully laying down rules are not of great interest to preschoolers. [SEP] Try playing a rule-based game with a 3- or 4-year-old, and you are likely to ﬁnd that the child is easily sidetracked. [SEP] If, with your prompting and guidance, the child does ﬁnish the game, he or she might say, “I won!” or “Everybody won!” regardless of the out	come	.

Furthermore, children acting out stories during pretend play are assisted in mastering the storytelling script, or basic framework of story organization. [SEP] Preschoolers’ pretend scenarios are often quite storylike, consisting of characters, settings, and plot sequences that include adventure, suspense, surprise, conﬂict, and resolution. [SEP] Witness the following trip to Sea World, during which Emily and her friends save Baby Shamu from danger: S: (to Emily) Would you	come	with us? [SEP] Let’s go to Sea World. [SEP] E: Sea World!

“Right, a cloak is a coat,” Lizzie explained. [SEP] The amount of time preschoolers spent talking with peers while pretending is positively associated with the size of their vocabularies at age 5.27 As children engage in play talk, they not only build their vocabularies but correct one another’s errors, either directly or by demonstrating the acceptable way to speak. [SEP] In one instance, a kindergartner enacting a telephone conversation said, “Hello,	come	to my house, please.” [SEP] Her play partner quickly countered with appropriate telephone greeting behavior: “No, ﬁrst you’ve got to say ‘How are you? What are you doing?’”28 Furthermore, the language skills required to express different points of view, resolve disagreements, and persuade peers to collaborate so play can continue are complex and often subtle. [SEP] Emily’s success in convincing several classmates to join the make-believe trip to Sea World was partly due to the way she approached them—by asking if they’d like to go. [SEP] By experimenting with language during play, children can see how others react to various styles of communication and use that information to reﬁne their way of speaking. [SEP] In this way, play is an ideal arena for mastering all aspects of conversational d	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
relations unless intense disagreements arise that threaten safety or (in the case of teachers) classroom order.76 [SEP] And when adults do step in, they seldom use interventions that help children regulate their own interaction. [SEP] Instead, adults often resort to directive strategies, in which they tell children exactly what to say and do and therefore solve the problem for them, as in, “Don’t grab. Ask for a turn!” or “Wait until Sandra is ﬁnished.”77 These techniques are appropriate for children who lack social skills and therefore, at least initially, beneﬁt from clear direction. [SEP] But adults need to modify these strategies to suit children’s play maturity, providing assistance tailored to the child’s “zone.” [SEP] Sticking with directive interventions does not prompt children to	come	up with effective solutions to conﬂict as it arises—strategies that work because they take into account both the child’s and the playmate’s desires. [SEP] At times, the adult might model a social skill or give the child examples of strategies, as in, “You could ask Paul, ‘Would you let me try it for a while?’ or you could say, ‘May we share it?’” At other times, the adult might encourage the child to generate possible strategies: “What could you do to get Mary and Andrea to let you play, too?” [SEP] In each instance, parents and teachers select the level of support that best matches the child’s current social capacities and then pull back as the child acquires new social problem-solving skills.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1

Most children build up to a tantrum gradually. [SEP] Parents can tell it’s in the offing, and sometimes they can distract the child before it reaches a peak. [SEP] For example, if the child is about to “blow” while you’re out shopping, try involving the child in the shopping experience—pointing out things of interest to the child; asking the child to help you select and carry purchases; and reminding the child that after the shopping is ﬁnished, you are going to do something the child enjoys. [SEP] When parents interrupt a tantrum on the rise by redirecting the child’s attention, they provide strategies children can use on their own to regulate emotion. [SEP] If parents always wait to intervene after the child has be	come	intensely distressed, it’s harder not only for the parent to calm the child but for the child to learn to calm down. [SEP] And once the child regains emotional control, reassuring the child of parental love with hugs and comforting words restores the parent–child relationship and strengthens the child’s sense of security. [SEP] Make-believe play is an effective context in which preschoolers can practice what to do when frustrated. [SEP] Parent and child can take turns acting out the “parent” and “child” roles. [SEP] While playing the “child,” the parent can get upset. [SEP] Then parent and child can	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
blings, and parental anger escalates. [SEP] The elementary school years are a time when sibling conﬂict can increase. [SEP] As children get feedback about how well they are doing in school and in other activities (such as sports and music lessons), parents may compare their accomplishments, especially when siblings are close in age and the same gender. [SEP] The child who feels less valued is likely to resent a sibling whom parents seem to prefer. [SEP] Therefore, when praising one child, parents should try not to diminish the merits of another. [SEP] If a sibling expresses jealousy, parents can remind the envious child of an admirable personal trait or a recent commendable performance. [SEP] But be careful not to give empty praise (not based on real accomplishment), which children quickly	come	to mistrust. [SEP] It may fuel jealousy of a sibling, whom the child concludes parents really appreciate. [SEP] In sum, parents can foster positive sibling ties through expressing warmth and affection, stressing each child’s positive qualities and achievements, and refraining from making comparisons. [SEP] When sibling relationships are friendly and sympathetic, they bring many beneﬁts, including gratifying companionship, emotional support, and assistance with everyday tasks.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
lts. [SEP] By collaborating with the child on a challenging task, the adult assesses what the child can already do and what the child is ready to learn, providing a support system for mastery. [SEP] The metaphor of a scaffold, discussed in Chapter 2, is an excellent guide for how to help your child with homework. [SEP] Scaffolding involves varying your assistance to ﬁt the child’s changing competence. [SEP] When the child says, “I don’t understand,” you can adjust the task, breaking it into smaller parts. [SEP] You can also provide prompts, hints, and explanations, increasing the amount and directiveness of your guidance until the child makes progress. [SEP] As you do so, you can assist the child in analyzing why certain problem-solving approaches work and others do not, encouraging her to	come	up with ideas for surmounting difficulties. [SEP] As she starts to apply the strategies derived from your dialogue, you can reduce the intensity of your intervention, letting her take over responsibility for the task. [SEP] Too often, parents imagine that their child’s classmates can do the homework assignment independently. [SEP] After all, they say to themselves, why would the teacher have assigned it if this weren’t so? [SEP] This pattern of reasoning leads parents down a counterproductive path. [SEP] “What’s wrong with my child?” they say to themselves. [SEP] “She should be able to do the assignment, just like everyone else!” [SEP] But recall that children of the same age differ widely in their “zones.” [SEP] And rooted in the very idea of the “zone” is that learning requires teaching! 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
om adults undermines girls’ conﬁdence in their ability to do well at math. [SEP] If a parent or teacher believes that a child is not very capable at a school subject, the adult may act surprised when the child succeeds, ascribing good performance to luck by saying something like this: “Gee, you did a lot better than I expected!” [SEP] And when the child fails, the adult may explain the failure by referring to mediocre ability: “You’re not very good at that, are you?” [SEP] Girls get much more of this type of feedback than do boys, especially in math.60 [SEP] In contrast, parents and teachers often attribute boys’ poor performance to misbehavior and lack of motivation. [SEP] “If only you’d listen and try,” they say, “you’d do much better.” [SEP] As a result of these messages, too many girls	come	to believe that when they succeed at math, their ability didn’t help them. [SEP] And after failure, they reason that weak ability, not insufficient effort, was at fault.

[SEP] Alabados were sung as ritual prayers in homes, at dawn, noon, and at nightfall, and they were almost always sung at funeral processions. [SEP] Their melodies are fusions of indigenous music and medieval chants. [SEP] Stories of Mexican California narrate the singing of alabados first thing in the morning by a family, each member in his/her own room, but all together at the same time. [SEP] Like the décima (ten-line poetic song) and the romance (four-line song), alabados were introduced into the New World by the Franciscan padres, who taught them to the Indian people as they were teaching them the Bible and converting them to Christianity. [SEP] In recent times alabados have	come	to mean any religious hymn sung at wakes or religious ceremonies. [SEP] Many are very old and the authors unknown, although a few collected in southern Colorado were written by a local singer in the 1940s. [SEP] Folklorists of the 1930s and 1940s were still able to collect some of these ancient hymns from elderly people who learned them from their parents in the nineteenth century. [SEP] Juan Rael published one of the first essays on the alabado in 1950, and a recent researcher, William Gonzalez of the University of Utah, calls them “some of the saddest music” (Ingalls B11).

Alambrista (Illegal Border Crosser) Literally, alambre is a wire, and an alambrista is a person who uses alambre. [SEP] The term has	come	to mean a person who crosses a wire fence, regardless of the means or method. [SEP] In this cultural usage the fence is the wire fence along the Mexican-U.S. border, the term is interchangeable with mojado (wetback), which refers to a person who enters the United States illegally by crossing the Rio Grande in Texas. [SEP] Alambrista is not as common an expression as wetback, but it is used frequently by the media. [SEP] The Mexican cinema has produced many films about illegal entry into the United States with many characters playing roles as alambristas. [SEP] An American film with the title Alambrista!

Burritos Literally a little burro or little donkey, a burrito has	come	to mean a taco made of a wheat flour tortilla instead of a corn tortilla, filled with meat, rice, frijoles (beans), and chile, then folded and rolled up. [SEP] There are several theories about the origins of the name burrito, and there may be some truth to all of them. [SEP] One theory is that when flour tortillas became available in northern Mexico, tacos de frijoles, or bean burritos, were easy to carry in the saddle-bags of the vaqueros (cowboys), so for this reason they came to be called burritos as though they were the sidekicks of the vaquero’s horse. [SEP] Tacos made from corn tortillas are much older; they have been around since the epoch of the Aztecs.

appearance. [SEP] The driver and/or owner is called a low rider and the act of low riding refers to all the activities associated with driving the car: cruising, caravanning, and hopping. [SEP] Low riders have commonly been associated with cholos (1990s urban youth) and gangs, but traditionally Chicanos seriously involved in low riding and customizing low-rider cars are not involved in gangs, and low-rider clubs actually present an alternative to gang involvement. [SEP] Low-rider car clubs communicate a message of cultural pride and unity. [SEP] Although different, the cholo subculture can be closely linked to the low-rider subculture. [SEP] It is not clear when low riding started, but it was already a custom by the 1930s in Los Angeles and Sacramento, although the name “low rider” did not	come	into usage until the 1960s. [SEP] After World War II, because of the growth in the economy, many Chicanos could afford to buy cars, old and new, and the practice of customizing cars and cruising became very popular throughout the Southwest and California during the 1950s. [SEP] The most popular cars to lower are long ones, such as Fords, Buicks, and Chevrolets. [SEP] Hydraulic lifts are used to lower and raise both the front and rear ends of a car. [SEP] Before it was discovered that a hydraulic lift could be used with the batteries stored in the trunk of the car, different methods were used to lower the chassis of the car. [SEP] Early crude methods were to place heavy bricks and cement bags in the trunk, or to cut the spring’s coils, or lower the car’s blocks.

Machismo Machismo describes a stereotypic image of a Chicano/Latino man who is extraordinarily aggressive, stresses dominance over his wife and family, exhibits physical and sexual prowess, and places strong emphasis on masculine rigidity. [SEP] Chicano social scientists have authored studies about machismo, noting that it is a stereotype often used against Chicanos to blame them for their underclass social position in American society. [SEP] Macho literally means “male,” and machismo is the concept of “maleness,” but in American culture it has	come	to mean an exaggerated masculinity. [SEP] A masculinity associated with violence, self-centeredness, chauvinism, or alcoholism is not a macho concept recognized by most Chicanos. [SEP] For Chicanos, un hombre macho is a man who symbolizes dignity, takes care of his family, has respect for all women, especially his mother, and possesses a strong sense of self-identity and character. [SEP] Many Chicanos grew up influenced by Mexican movies, with characters like Pedro Infante, Cantinflas, Antonio Aguilar, and Jorge Negrete, as men who sang to the beautiful girls and defended the poor by fighting for justice and social equality. [SEP] These were positive images of machos.

La Mano Negra (The Black Hand) In parts of the Southwest, children were disciplined by parents who narrated scary stories of The Black Hand. [SEP] If they didn’t behave or do as they were told, La Mano Negra would take them away. [SEP] In the Ernest Baughman Collection at the University of New Mexico Library, an informant narrates being told by her grandfather in Tesuque, New Mexico, about La Mano Negra. [SEP] A young woman remembers, “My grandfather used to tell us when we were little, about La Mano Negra, that appeared every time little kids were bad and that if we weren’t good and helped him carry in wood and water and feed the animals ‘la mano negra’ would	come	for us at night. It would get really big, take us from our beds and never bring us back home” (November 1974). [SEP] Members of the academic electronic listserv CHICLE have held discussions and reminisced about La Mano Negra. [SEP] One member remembered it by the name of La Mano Pachona without knowing its origin, but the fear of it was well remembered by all. [SEP] Marc Simmons writes about a legend of La Mano Negra from the town of Bernalillo, New Mexico.

s, it portrays the betrayal of Montezuma by the Spaniards, and the acceptance of Christianity by Montezuma. [SEP] Its Iberian origins lie in the conflict between the Christians and Moors. [SEP] The Danza de los Matachines is probably the only ritual dance that is danced by both Hispanic and Native American communities in New Mexico. [SEP] The word matachines can translate to mean “clowning” or “trickery,” but can also mean “puppet player,” “jester,” and “buffoon.” [SEP] Matachines refers to the men who dance as a group; the group is composed usually of twelve men, but can have from ten to fourteen. [SEP] In sixteenth-century Europe a matachin was a masked dancer, an entertainer who danced with a sword. [SEP] It is likely that the Moors transplanted the dance to Europe and that matachin may	come	from the Arabic word mutawajjihin, meaning “to assume a mask.” [SEP] There are many eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary references to a matachine sword dance, indicating that such a dance was performed in Europe. [SEP] Similar to the dance-drama of Los Moros y Cristianos, the dance of Los Matachines was taught to the subjugated Indians by the Spanish missionaries as a custom to celebrate on Christian feast days but also as a means of converting them to Catholicism. [SEP] Flavia Waters Champe’s interpretation is that the dance was brought to New Mexico by Spanish and Mexican settlers who came with De Vargas at the time of the second conquest in 1692.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
legal name of the card is Alien Registration Receipt Card (Form I-151 or I-551). [SEP] The card is no longer a green color, but it has continued to be called this since at least the 1970s. [SEP] Illegal trafficking in the mica is very common, and there have always been forgeries of the green card and social security cards as well. [SEP] Undocumented immigrants manage to learn where to purchase such forgeries. [SEP] In the streets of southern California a person who sells micas is referred to as a miquero. [SEP] It is unknown how the word mica originated as a name for the green card. [SEP] In Spanish a mica is a female monkey, but it is used for a woman who flirts with men or a coquette. [SEP] The mica is definitely an enticement that lures men to the United States. [SEP] Illegal immigrants	come	from Mexico in search of work in California and other states of the Southwest, and most are willing to do anything for employment. [SEP] The folklore generated from this experience has been frozen into legends and family oral histories. [SEP] The mica is a coveted trophy that opens doors to employment. [SEP] Sometimes it can be gotten illegally by purchase or legally by marrying an American and becoming a legal resident. [SEP] These experiences are dramatized in corridos (ballads). [SEP] One corrido, “Mi Micaela,” hides the word mica in a woman’s name Micaela, but the first line gives it away: “Tú eres mi Mica, Mica, mi Micaela, Tú representas todo lo que mi alma anhela” (You are my Mica, Mica, my Micaela, You represent all that my soul desires).

La Migra (Immigration Officials) La migra is an abbreviated and slang term for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the Border Patrol. [SEP] The phrase “hay viene la migra!” has been cried out in fear for many generations in Mexicano and Chicano communities and in the workplaces where they are employed. [SEP] Raids by la migra are commonplace and have been depicted in films, novels, jokes, and verbal narratives for many years. [SEP] Migra is short for the Spanish word immigración, and has be	come	an important and viable character in the vocabulary and culture of Chicanos and Mexicanos alike. [SEP] Cartoons and jokes often depict la migra officials as overweight policemen who chase down innocent women and children. [SEP] In the folk dramas of El Teatro Campesino (the Farmworkers’ Theater), la migra was often characterized as an unscrupulous arrogant patrol officer who accepted bribes from the growers and ordered raids in the agricultural fields to arrest undocumented immigrants the day before payday. [SEP] Starting in the late 1940s and into the present, la migra made raids in the San Joaquin Valley of California, rounding up braceros who had overstayed their contract time allocation.

Mojado (Wetback) A translation of the word “wetback,” sometimes spelled moja’o, which literally simply means “wet.” [SEP] It is a pejorative expression, although it is sometimes used by Mexican people to describe themselves and their experience of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to	come	to the United States. [SEP] Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos, with the same prejudicial meaning as “greaser” or “spic.” [SEP] Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants. [SEP] Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called “wets.” [SEP] Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels. [SEP] In Mexico, the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas, a literal translation for the word wetback. [SEP] In 1955 a well--established Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas, which intended to persuade Mexicans not to go to the United States.

southwestern Spanish, the older archaic Spanish from New Mexico, Mexican slang, standard Spanish from Mexico City, and also words invented by the pachucos themselves. [SEP] The pachuco dialect was the product of an urban environment, and it is believed the language may have originated in the underworld and drug scene of El Paso. [SEP] George Carpenter Barker pinpoints almost exactly where the pachuco jargon originated, from the 7-X gang who first met in the neighborhood of Florence and Eighth Streets in El Paso. [SEP] Arthur Campa believes that pachucos originated as a linguistic group first and had no distinctive dress style. [SEP] That came later as they moved into a more stable economic environment and had some financial resources. [SEP] Expressions and vocabulary used by Chicanos today	come	from the pachuco argot of the 1940s. [SEP] For example, such words as órale (what’s happening, or O.K.), bato (guy, as in bato loco), califas (California), hay te wuacho (I’ll be seeing you), and la pinta (jail/prison) have been used for generations. [SEP] The film Zoot Suit, written and directed by Luis Valdez in 1981, depicts the dress, language, and problems of Mexican American youth and especially pachucos in Los Angeles in the 1940s. [SEP] During the 1940s a caricature of the pachuco was created for the Mexican media in the person of Tin Tan, whose real name was Germán Valdéz (1919–1973).

Pintos (-as) (Prisoners) Pinto is a term used for prison and also for a Chicano prison inmate. [SEP] A pinto is a male prisoner, a pinta a female prisoner. [SEP] La Pinta, referring to prison, is believed to	come	from the word penitenciaria, or “penitentiary.” [SEP] Other common words for prison are bote, meaning “can,” and corre, which is short for “correctional institution,” referring specifically to one in Texas. [SEP] “Joint” is another word frequently used to mean prison. [SEP] There has been a lot of sociological literature written about the formation of gangs in prisons as a means of surviving incarceration in the United States. [SEP] The media, including 60 Minutes, has done stories about the activities of the Mexican mafia and La Familia. [SEP] Often ignored is the subculture of the pinto experience that is exhibited in behavior, art expression, and published poetry.

[SEP] It just happened that Quetzalcoatl promised to return in the same year that Hernán Cortés landed in Veracruz. [SEP] It was to the Spaniards’ advantage to use the Indians’ belief in Quetzalcoatl’s return. [SEP] Cortés was well received because he was thought to be Quetzalcoatl and the conquest of the Aztecs by the Spaniards was legitimized. [SEP] Quetzalcoatl is one of the better-known Aztec gods and has been greatly idealized by the moderns, including Chicanos. [SEP] His image has influenced artists, writers, philosophers, and painters for hundreds of years. [SEP] As the celestial dragon, he is patterned after the rattlesnake, a common mythical creature in Mesoamerica. [SEP] This dragon has	come	to symbolize the Chicanos’ early heritage and has been embraced by Chicanos, especially those coming of age in the 1970s. [SEP] Quetzalcoatl can be found in the literature, murals, and graphic art reflecting Chicano culture and the Chicano movement of the 1960s and 1970s. [SEP] In 1970 an American Indian and Chicano college was started in northern California with the name Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl College. [SEP] This college was still in existence in the year 2000 and has struggled to maintain a curriculum that meets the needs of both Indian and Chicano students.

[SEP] The term encompasses all Latinos (Latin Americans) who are descendents of the Spanish and Indian encounter. [SEP] The Mexican intellectual José Vasconcelos wrote a book in 1925 titled La Raza Cósmica: Misión de la Raza Iberoamericana. [SEP] Publishing after the Mexican Revolution, Vasconcelos envisioned the successful future of Mexico to lie in the strong bonds of its mixed-race population.

[SEP] On the second try Juan Diego saw the bishop, his story was heard and questioned, but was not believed. [SEP] The bishop wanted a sign from the Great Lady so that he would know it was really she who was sending Juan Diego. [SEP] Diego intended to go back to Tepeyac and inform the beautiful woman, but when he returned home he found that his uncle Juan Bernardino was extremely ill. [SEP] The next morning, on December 12, as he walked to Tlatelolco to call a priest to	come	to his uncle’s side, the beautiful woman came to him a third time asking what was wrong. [SEP] Diego told her of his sick uncle and of the request from the bishop. [SEP] She told him his uncle was now well and would not die and sent him to the top of a hill to cut fresh flowers that he was to take to the bishop as proof of her existence. [SEP] Diego followed her instructions and at the top of the hill he found beautiful roses of Castile, still covered with dew. [SEP] He cut them and The Lady, the Mother of God, arranged them in his tilma (cloak) and sent him to the bishop, with the proof requested.

ddle European conception of freedom as the privilege that arises from living in a matrix of protective state regulations. [SEP] It is not nature but the law that makes us free. [SEP] Freedom is realized not by the state’s absence but from the construction of a network of laws that liberate the individual from the oppression that would otherwise occur. [SEP] Compulsory temperance and drug laws generate freedom for those who are able to stay clean. [SEP] Prohibitions against sexual self-degradation and peep shows strengthen the inner freedom of our human selves. [SEP] This is the European conception of constitutional freedom. [SEP] When the German Basic Law of 1949 declares human dignity to be the foundational value of the constitution, the implications run through all relationships that may	come	into being. [SEP] This “third-party effect” means that private individuals are bound to respect the human dignity in each other, precisely as they are bound not to subject each other to relationships of involuntary servitude or, during Prohibition, not to sell each other alcoholic beverages. [SEP] Today, men and women must avoid sexual harassment on the job, even though in this case the “third-party” effect arises not directly from the Constitution but from federal legislation.

n his agenda was revamping the legal system. [SEP] In 1804, he charged a group of lawyers with the task of drafting a new civil code in language accessible to ordinary people. [SEP] The committee produced the elegant Code civil, now a mainstay of French culture and a model for civil codification all over the world. [SEP] The language is so refined that the novelist Henri Stendhal reportedly reviewed the style of ten code provisions every night before retiring. [SEP] Today, when the Francophones in Quebec preach the distinctiveness of their culture, they never fail to mention their Code civil, modeled after Napoleon’s effort to use the law as the means of restoring civilized order to France. [SEP] The Code civil has proved to be remarkably durable in French culture. [SEP] Constitutions have	come	and gone and the French have endured recurrent changes of regime, including communes, dictatorships, and five distinct republics. [SEP] Yet, through all this, the civil code has survived. [SEP] It is the cultural monument that unites the French across history. [SEP] In its substantive content, the Code civil is strongly identified with the achievements of the 1789 Revolution against the ancien regime. [SEP] The code sweeps away the vestiges of feudal influence in the law of property and in the law of evidence and proclaims a liberal legal order. [SEP] The end of feudalism in the law of property meant that a single concept of ownership would replace the ancient system of embedded estates.

 Code civil related to the French feudal order or, as any redeemed legal culture compares to the brutality and chaos that precedes it. [SEP] The American hope for a new beginning lay in the Reconstruction Amendments—the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth—all enacted in quest of a new definition of freedom and equality under the law. [SEP] The first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment specified who would be a member of the new polity: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. . . .” [SEP] With a single stroke the new constitution erased the effects of one of the worst blemishes in American constitutional history—the Dred Scott decision of 1857, which held that persons of African descent could never be	come	citizens of the United States.

intuition that these words defined America after the Civil War. [SEP] Yet, because we know these resonant phrases, we rarely stop to listen and ponder the meaning of each well-crafted line. [SEP] Let us now put ourselves among the crowd of mourners at Gettysburg. [SEP] Let us transport ourselves back into the frame of mind of those suffering losses, those looking for the meaning of brothers slaughtering brothers. [SEP] Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. [SEP] Now we are engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. [SEP] We are met on a great battlefield of that war. [SEP] We have	come	to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. [SEP] It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. [SEP] But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate—we cannot consecrate—we cannot hallow this ground. [SEP] The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. [SEP] The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. [SEP] It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.

 the phrases so carefully chosen. [SEP] The words of the Gettysburg Address are too powerful, they represent too much concentrated energy and wisdom, to be absorbed in the two minutes that it takes to read them slowly. [SEP] I suggest that we proceed and listen, sentence by sentence, phrase by phrase, to these words heard so often. [SEP] The first sentence states the heart of the matter and sums up the past, present, and future of the American commitment. [SEP] Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. [SEP] This sentence alone was enough to formulate the preamble to the new constitution. [SEP] It harbingers the themes that follow in the address and that will	come	to dominate American life for the rest of the 1860s. [SEP] Let us read each of these phrases as elements in the preamble to the postbellum constitutional order. [SEP] Four score and seven years ago. [SEP] . . By 1863, a historical consciousness had taken hold in American thinking. Rooting ourselves in the past stands in sharp contrast to the preamble of the 1787 Constitution, which begins simply, without setting the context: “We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union. . . .” [SEP] There is no reference in the 1787 document to the first settlement dating back some 160 years, no sense that the new country was the outgrowth of an English-speaking culture across the seas. In 1863 the nation still desired to create “a more perfect Union,” but it had in addition a 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Of course, during the war, the 1787 Constitution remained nominally in force. [SEP] There was little suggestion of a “military dictatorship,” though some Northern critics of the government invoked the phrase. [SEP] Lincoln’s elected term came to an end in March 1865. [SEP] In the midst of the war, therefore, he was constitutionally required to stand for reelection. [SEP] This event in itself warranted the stability of American institutions, but still ambiguity reigned on the shape of the postbellum constitutional order. [SEP] The confusion came to a head in 1868 when the House impeached Lincoln’s successor, President Andrew Johnson, for arguably asserting excessive executive power in firing his Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. [SEP] The out	come	of that impeachment trial is well known: Johnson avoided conviction by one vote.

mage of God” provided a powerful rallying point for a crusade to correct the original mistake of 1787. [SEP] Of course, various biblical passages served the other side as well, but the ardor for abolition drew heavily and indispensably on the sense of a higher law. [SEP] The Gettysburg Address, as written, apparently did not contain the reference to “this nation, under God.” [SEP] As he spoke, Lincoln spontaneously broke with his prepared text. [SEP] The reference to God appears in neither of the drafts that his assistants, John Hay and John Nicolay, said were the prepared texts. [SEP] Yet, the four journalists who were present reported hearing the divine invocation, though some observers have Lincoln saying “this nation shall under God have a new birth” rather than the word order that has	come	to be accepted “this nation, under God, shall have a new birth.”14 The reference to “this nation under God” reinforces the conception of the nation as an organic entity, a single subject that could, like the Jews, enter into a covenant with a God. [SEP] The substitution of the Americans for the covenanted Jews—however sacrilegious the idea may sound—landed in the New World with the Puritans and became a standard item of Protestant theology. [SEP] Thus, we can understand Lincoln referring at Trenton to the Americans as “His [God’s] almost chosen people.”15	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
ferring to “men” as collective entities: “all peoples have equal status.” [SEP] It was not particularly novel to argue that all nations, all states, had an equal claim to govern themselves. [SEP] The principle of national self-determination, urged so adamantly in the twentieth century, derives from the same source: every nation is entitled to preserve its own culture, cultivate its language, and express itself as a subject of the international community. [SEP] International law is based on the idea that nations, anchored in the form of states, enter into legal relationships. [SEP] The states in which nations are embodied enjoy legal personalities. [SEP] They incur debts and, significantly, these debts are not extinguished by revolutionary changes of government. [SEP] The forms of the state	come	and go, and the nation endures through it all. [SEP] It is no wonder, therefore, that the Declaration of Independence would assert that the American people were equally entitled, with all other nations, to determine their form of government. [SEP] These two senses of the famous “all men are created equal” capture the ambiguous quality of the American revolt against the British. [SEP] It was both a revolutionary and an anticolonial war of independence. [SEP] The revolutionary spirit was captured in the categorical rejection of monarchy. [SEP] The anticolonial thrust appears in the assertion of the Americans’ equal claim to rule by “consent of the governed.”	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
icolonial thrust appears in the assertion of the Americans’ equal claim to rule by “consent of the governed.” [SEP] More far-reaching than both of these original meanings, however, is the individualist interpretation: All human beings are of equal dignity. [SEP] They are created equal and remain equal in the eyes of their Creator. [SEP] There can be no foundation, therefore, for the claim that whites are superior to blacks or that men should count more than women. [SEP] Of course, many framers of the Declaration were slave owners and most, if not all of them, were patriarchal heads of households. [SEP] Yet, they bequeathed to the world a rhetorical phrase that was pregnant with meaning deeper than many of them may have intended. [SEP] This deeper meaning lay, embedded in the text, ready to	come	alive for the first time as their Declaration became the sacred text of the American abolitionist movement. [SEP] Legal texts often bear one meaning on their surface and a higher meaning that requires faith and personal investment beyond the surface meaning. [SEP] A good example is the commandment in the Decalogue prohibiting homicide. [SEP] Allow me a short digression on the commandment against killing to illustrate the phenomenon of a text that carries one meaning on its surface and a more radical meaning beneath.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Gettysburg forged a link between the nation and egalitarian thinking that we sometimes forget. [SEP] The connection between the limited nation and unbounded equality has paradoxical overtones. [SEP] The nation is dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. [SEP] The thrust toward equality has universalist implications. [SEP] Neither Lincoln in 1863 nor the founders in 1776 argued that only “Americans” were created equal. [SEP] The claim was that all people—in principle, all human beings on the planet—are born with equal dignity. [SEP] Yet, this universalistic thinking thins our commitment to equality to a point of fragility. [SEP] Equality flourishes in an environment of mutual sympathy and reciprocal identification. [SEP] The love for each and the needs of each	come	to the fore in the affective bonds of family, friendship, tribe, and, by extension, in the reciprocal attachments of nationhood. [SEP] The limited political sphere of the nation facilitates the recognition of others as human beings sharing a common history. [SEP] If blacks and whites, Northerners and Southerners, eventually men and women, could respect each other as Americans participating in the same national drama, they would lay a foundation for affirming their mutual equality. [SEP] They need not be brothers and not exactly friends, but they could at last recognize each other as compatriots with a common language, a single history, and a shared future. [SEP] The source for this association between bonds of affection and equality lies outside the Judeo-Christian tradition, notably in the	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
eteenth century, it was relatively easy to believe that we were in the grip of a great historical force, possibly emanating from a higher power. [SEP] “IN GOD WE TRUST” became a popular motto, appearing for the first time on the nation’s coinage in 1864. [SEP] Trust in God can generate diverse conclusions, but this does not subtract from the obvious way in which, at the time, faith in God and the Bible nourished the radical claims of human equality. [SEP] For modern readers, those who do not think instinctively in the idiom of Genesis and the Psalms, it is worth reviewing the kind of argument for equality found in biblical sources. [SEP] The central idea that generates the concept of universal humanity or universal brotherhood is that we are made in the image of God. [SEP] As the story has	come	down to us from Genesis 1, 26, and 27: And God said, Let us make man [Adam] in our own image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, over all the cattle, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.

ing and important differences between human dignity and autonomy, and we shall return to these later. [SEP] For now, it is important to note merely that the postbellum legal order begins with a commitment of all state power to eliminate the evil that had cursed the United States since its founding. [SEP] Significantly, both human dignity and autonomy, both due process and equality, transcend the limits of the nation. [SEP] It is not only our nationals who are entitled to these basic human rights. [SEP] All human beings, all persons, should enjoy the same rights—at least so far as they are within the jurisdiction of the state securing those rights. [SEP] Our commitment to nationhood generates the reciprocal sympathy that enables us to make the move from particular to universal. [SEP] We may	come	to understand the meaning of basic rights in the context of the nation but then we are driven to see that all persons, whether members of the nation or not, are entitled to the same treatment.

Nationhood and Citizenship As much as Lincoln sought to evoke a consciousness of American nationhood, this idea did not readily resonate in the minds of lawyers. [SEP] The word “nation” was not used in the postbellum amendments. [SEP] I doubt if it even occurred to counsel for the butchers to	come	into court and argue that independent tradesmen had a right, granted to them by the American nation, to practice their trade without the duty to pay tolls and use specific facilities. [SEP] Their rights derived, if from anyplace, from universal principles governing the free market and dignity of working people. [SEP] Yet, this very argument—that the nation was the source of rights acquired under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments—would show itself, remarkably, in a majestic dissenting opinion in 1883.17 The idea of the American nation may have been in the air in the 1870s, but it was not part of the stock of concepts that the Court would draw on directly to domesticate its abstract sense of justice. [SEP] The concept of an American nation was part of the American creed, but it had yet	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
It is clear in this passage that the nation, as distinct from government, creates rights, grants citizenship; it has objectives that it seeks to accomplish, but it must act through the prescribed processes of the law. [SEP] The nation acts initially in the process of constitutional amendment, and then, by means of delegated authority, through the Congress. [SEP] The nation has expressed its will by precisely these means in the Reconstruction Amendments, which delegated Congress authority to engage in the kind of legislation under attack in the Civil Rights Cases. [SEP] The logic of the argument traces the genesis of the nation-state. [SEP] First the nation	come	s into being as a prelegal organic unity, and then the nation expresses itself in a governmental structure. [SEP] One might properly inquire how the idea of the nation’s expressing its will differs from “We the People” acting in concert for the sake of a better government. [SEP] The differences are admittedly subtle. [SEP] Perhaps the accent in Justice Harlan’s mind was on the historical bond implied in the war that held the nation together. [SEP] Yet, it is no accident that the expression “We the People” is absent in the rhetoric of his dissenting opinion. [SEP] The problem he addressed was not one that the people could decide for themselves. [SEP] The question “Who constitutes the nation?” does not lend itself to democratic resolution.

[SEP] This is a remarkable thesis, for the general tendency is to assume that the amendments consist in a hodgepodge of special responses to unrelated problems. [SEP] The dominant theme is the spread of the franchise and the fine-tuning of the system of democratic representation. [SEP] But there are other strains from the Secret Constitution as well.

ens. [SEP] If we think of the Civil War as a moral drama, we cannot but perceive a government at work that is committed to the dignity of all. [SEP] The drama can be narrowly understood as an enormous sacrifice of human life to liberate people held in the most demeaning condition imaginable. [SEP] The war snuffed out one life, one being created in the image of God, for every seven slaves freed. [SEP] There might have been a less costly way of solving the problem. [SEP] Simply waiting and negotiating, we might have seen the market itself render the keeping of slaves too costly an enterprise. [SEP] Industrialization spreading South might have made “free labor” a more appealing alternative for those who profited from the system of slave labor. [SEP] The end of plantation capitalism might have	come	as safely as the demise of communism in Europe. [SEP] But these possible scenarios are beside the point. [SEP] The sacrifice did occur. [SEP] And we thought it was necessary, as Lincoln preached, to cleanse us of our “offences” and to give the nation a “new birth of freedom.” [SEP] We could not have survived this drama with anything but a sense that government was capable of a great moral undertaking. [SEP] Government was no longer instituted simply to keep the peace, deliver the mail, and protect us from foreign enemies but also to ensure that we not descend into the kind of evil that seared the soul of the first American Republic.

commitment to national pride ran into a contrary trend in American thought that had been in the process of emergence for over a century. [SEP] The impulse to protect the flag against desecration confronted the rising devotion to the cardinal American value of free speech. [SEP] Since World War I and the dissenting opinion of Justices Holmes and Brandeis,16 the American recognition of the primacy of free speech has been on an upward trajectory. [SEP] The Supreme Court, including its most conservative justices, has consistently favored the primacy of speech over the interests of victims injured or offended by the rough and ready rumble of the “marketplace of ideas.”17 The collision was inevitable. [SEP] Two American ideas—protecting the flag and celebrating freedom of speech—would eventually	come	into focus as contradictory ways of being American. [SEP] It was a close battle, but in two sharply divided votes of the 1990s, the Supreme Court decided that freedom of expression must prevail.18 [SEP] But this was hardly a defeat for the politics of national sentiment. [SEP] Those who loved the flag still had recourse to civil society.19 [SEP] The proponents of patriotic rituals, such as honoring the flag, could learn from the history of religious sensibility in the United States. [SEP] The government cannot coerce religious observance without, as John Locke argued in his first Letter Concerning Toleration (1689), corrupting the act of faith into an empty gesture of external compliance. [SEP] The opposite effect occurs when the government seeks to punish those who burn the flag. [SEP] The	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] We have seen a glimmer of something like a fourth law, a tendency for self-constructing biospheres to enlarge their workspace, the dimensionality of their adjacent possible, perhaps as fast, on average, as is possible  glimmers only, not yet well-founded theory nor well-established fact.

[SEP] Each time the molecular diversity of the biosphere expands, the set of adjacent possible reactions expands even faster. [SEP] Recall our simple calculation that for modestly complex organic molecules, any pair of molecules could undergo at least one two substrate–two product reaction. [SEP] But then the diversity of possible reactions is the square of the diversity of chemicals in the system.

But there is an alternative approach to the link between the quantum and the classical worlds. [SEP] This possible approach is based on the well-established phenomenon of “decoherence.” [SEP] Decoherence arises when a quantum-coherent Schrödinger wave is propagating and the quantum system interacts with another quantum system having many coupled variables, or degrees of freedom. [SEP] The consequence can be that the Schrödinger wave function of the first quantum system be	come	s entangled in very complex ways with the other complex quantum system, which may be thought of as the environment. [SEP] Rather like water waves swirling into tiny granular nooks and crannies along a rugged fractal beach, the initial coherent Schrödinger equation representing the initial quantum system swirls into tiny and highly diverse patterns of interaction with the quantum system representing the environment. [SEP] The consequence of this intermixing is decoherence. [SEP] To understand the core of decoherence, one must understand that the exhibition of interference phenomena, the hallmark of quantum mechanics noted in the double-slit photon experiment, requires that literally all the propagating possible pathways in Feynman’s sum over histories that are to arrive at each point on the 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
nts of nature by maximizing constructive interference over a sum of all histories through a space of both configurations and laws. [SEP] Even if that program were to succeed, it does not necessarily yield a complex universe, let alone one poised roughly between expansion and contraction. [SEP] Might we see ways to understand why the universe is complex? [SEP] Perhaps, but merely perhaps. [SEP] I return to the thoughts earlier in this chapter that decoherence requires coupling systems and the loss of phase information. [SEP] If, in general, complex and high-diversity quantum systems with many coupled degrees of freedom lose phase information when they interact more rapidly than an equal number of simple, low-diversity quantum systems with the same total number of interacting parts, then the	come	asuring of entangled quantum systems should tend toward higher complexity, diversity, and classicity. [SEP] In short, complexity and diversity would beget classicity irreversibly. [SEP] In turn, this would lead to a preferred tendency toward a lock-in of complexity and diversity. [SEP] There is a sense in which classical objects are like the constraints on the release of energy that permits work to be done. [SEP] Classical objects, interacting with quantum objects, lead to decoherence and more classicity. [SEP] Complex pairs of quantum objects that decohere readily, or classical objects and those quantum objects that are caused to decohere readily when interacting with the classical object, form preferred pairs that tend to decohere, hence be	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
t Is Life? [SEP] is credited with inspiring a generation of physicists and biologists to seek the fundamental character of living systems. [SEP] Schrödinger brought quantum mechanics, chemistry, and the still poorly formulated concept of “information” into biology. [SEP] He is the progenitor of our understanding of DNA and the genetic code. [SEP] Yet as brilliant as was Schrödinger’s insight, I believe he missed the center. [SEP] Investigations seeks that center and finds, in fact, a mystery. [SEP] In my previous two books, I laid out some of the growing reasons to think that evolution was even richer than Darwin supposed. [SEP] Modern evolutionary theory, based on Darwin’s concept of descent with heritable variations that are sifted by natural selection to retain the adaptive changes, has	come	to view selection as the sole source of order in biological organisms. [SEP] But the snowflake’s delicate sixfold symmetry tells us that order can arise without the benefit of natural selection. [SEP] Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe give good grounds to think that much of the order in organisms, from the origin of life itself to the stunning order in the development of a newborn child from a fertilized egg, does not reflect selection alone. [SEP] Instead, much of the order in organisms, I believe, is self-organized and spontaneous. [SEP] Self-organization mingles with natural selection in barely understood ways to yield the magnificence of our teeming biosphere. [SEP] We must, therefore, expand evolutionary theory.

 constraints, yet constraints on the release of energy are required for work to be done. [SEP] Here is the heart of a new concept of “organization” that is not covered by our concepts of matter alone, energy alone, entropy alone, or information alone. [SEP] In turn, this led me to wonder about the relation between the emergence of constraints in the universe and in a biosphere, and the diversification of patterns of the constrained release of energy that alone constitute work and the use of that work to build still further constraints on the release of energy. [SEP] How do biospheres construct themselves or how does the universe construct itself? [SEP] The considerations above led to the role of Maxwell’s demon, one of the major places in physics where matter, energy, work, and information	come	together. [SEP] The central point of the demon is that by making measurements on a system, the information gained can be used to extract work. [SEP] I made a new distinction between measurements the demon might make that reveal features of nonequilibrium systems that can be used to extract work, and measurements he might make of the nonequilibrium system that cannot be used to extract work.

c task, where a catalytic task is the binding of a transition state of a reaction. [SEP] Just as similar molecules can have similar shapes, so too can similar reactions have similar transition states, hence, such reactions constitute similar catalytic tasks. [SEP] Just as diVerent molecules can have the same shape, so too can diVerent reactions have similar transition states, hence constitute the “same” catalytic task. [SEP] Just as an antibody can bind to and cover a ball of similar shapes, an enzyme can bind to and cover a ball of similar catalytic tasks. [SEP] Just as a finite number of balls can cover shape space, a finite number of balls can cover catalytic task space. [SEP] In short, a universal enzymatic toolbox is possible. [SEP] Clues that such a toolbox is experimentally feasible	come	from many recent developments, including the discovery that antibody molecules, evolved to bind molecular features called epitopes, can actually act as catalysts. [SEP] Catalytic antibodies are obtained exactly as one might expect, given the concept of a catalytic task space. [SEP] One would like an antibody molecule that binds the transition state of a reaction. [SEP] But transition states are ephemeral. [SEP] Since they last only fractions of a second, one cannot immunize with a transition state itself. [SEP] Instead, one immunizes with a stable analogue of the transition shape; that is, one immunizes with a second molecule that represents the “same” catalytic task as does the transition state itself.

[SEP] If landscapes are very rugged and the high peaks do not cluster into smallish regions, recombination turns out to be a useless search strategy. [SEP] But most organisms are sexual.

[SEP] No one knows. [SEP] The strange thing about evolution is that everyone thinks he understands it.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
The theorem is correct. [SEP] In the absence of any knowledge, or constraint, on the fitness landscape, on average, any search procedure is as good as any other. [SEP] But life uses mutation, recombination, and selection. [SEP] These search procedures seem to be working quite well. [SEP] Your typical bat or butterfly has managed to get itself evolved and seems a rather impressive entity. [SEP] The no-free-lunch theorem brings into high relief the puzzle. [SEP] If mutation, recombination, and selection only work well on certain kinds of fitness landscapes, yet most organisms are sexual, and hence use recombination, and all organisms use mutation as a search mechanism, where did these well-wrought fitness landscapes	come	from, such that evolution manages to produce the fancy stuV around us? [SEP] Here, I think, is how. [SEP] Think of an organism’s niche as a way of making a living. [SEP] Call a way of making a living a “natural game.” [SEP] Then, of course, natural games evolve with the organisms making those livings during the past four billion years. [SEP] What, then, are the “winning games”? [SEP] Naturally, the winning games are the games the winning organisms play. [SEP] One can almost see Darwin nod. [SEP] But what games are those?

[SEP] Ways of making a living, natural games, that are well searched out and well mastered by the evolutionary search strategies of organisms, namely, mutation and recombination, will be precisely the niches, or ways of making a living, that a diversifying and speciating population of organisms will manage to master. [SEP] The ways of making a living presenting fitness landscapes that can be well searched by the procedures that organisms have in hand will be the very ways of making a living that readily	come	into existence.

Well, let’s have at it. [SEP] I begin with the cornerstone of thermodynamics, the Carnot cycle. [SEP] Sadi Carnot was a French engineer writing in the 1830s. [SEP] The French had recently lost the Napoleonic Wars, Waterloo had	come	and gone, a certain famous statue to Wellington had been erected in London. [SEP] Carnot, like others at the time, realized that part of the success achieved by the English had to do with early industrial economic power. [SEP] The Brits had large numbers of steam pumps that were able to clear water from coal and iron mines, allowing miners to work under bad but relatively dry conditions and extract coal and iron more eVectively than could their French counterparts. [SEP] The coal and iron in turn were worked into the machinery of the Industrial Revolution and cannons and also, notably, more steam pumps that could keep the mines in working condition. [SEP] I find it fascinating that the British system was an autocatalytic technology, iron and coal fueled the manufacture of pumps that abetted	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
 At the end of the cycle, the Carnot engine returns to the initial state with the piston raised and filled with hot compressed gas at the temperature of the hot reservoir. [SEP] The Carnot engine is all set as a total organization to receive another input of heat energy and perform another work cycle. [SEP] Suppose that there were no cycle? [SEP] For example, a cannon fires a cannonball that hits a standing steel beam that is knocked over and hits a lever arm tossing a ball on its opposite end into the air which then falls to the ground and stops. [SEP] To get the contraption to do it again would require that somehow the cannon be reloaded, the steel beam be reset on end, the lever arm to be reset with a ball on its other end. [SEP] Where is all this organization of processes and events to	come	from? [SEP] I will return to these issues in the next chapter, but notice for now that the cyclic organization of processes in the Carnot, the steam, the gas, and the electric engines achieve the requisite organization precisely because the system works as a cyclic process. [SEP] A second issue concerns a well-known feature of the Carnot engine that is very much worth comment here. [SEP] If the sequence of steps is run in the reverse directions, so that the engine is run from state 1 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1, the Carnot engine is not performing as a pump at all. [SEP] It is, instead, performing as a refrigerator. [SEP] Run in the reverse direction, the Carnot engine uses mechanical work to pump heat from the cool reservoir, T2, to the hot reservoir, T1, making T2 cooler.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
The third point, of course, concerns spontaneous processes and nonspontaneous processes. [SEP] It took more than fifty years from Carnot’s work to really begin to understand thermodynamics = the first law, conservation of energy; the famous and mysterious second law and its handmaiden, entropy; the third law concerning a zero temperature at which molecular motions stop = and for the invention of statistical mechanics to connect thermodynamics and Newtonian mechanics. [SEP] Some processes occur spontaneously, some conceivable processes do not. [SEP] One of the most obvious cases is that if a hot gas is in contact with a cold gas, the two will in due course	come	to be the same temperature. [SEP] Heat spontaneously “diVuses” from the hot to the cold object, cooling the former, warming the latter. [SEP] In statistical mechanics we think of “hot” as corresponding to atoms moving rapidly, hence, with high kinetic energy. [SEP] When these high-kinetic-energy atoms interact with slower-moving sets of atoms, the collisions transfer kinetic energy to the slower-moving atoms, speeding them up and slowing down the faster-moving atoms. [SEP] Eventually, the atoms in the two sets	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Well, of course, the winning natural games are the games the winners play. [SEP] But what natural games are these? [SEP] The reasonable answer leaps to mind. [SEP] The winning games must be those that are readily searched out by the very adaptive search procedures used by the coevolving autonomous agents themselves. [SEP] In short, a biosphere is a self-consistent coevolutionary construction of autonomous agents and ways of making a living that are themselves self-consistently well searched by the search procedures the autonomous agents are using. [SEP] In colloquial terms, from our experience in economic systems, jobs	come	into existence with jobholders.

Bluntly in front of us: The closure of catalytic and work tasks in an autonomous agent by which it genuinely constructs a rough second copy from small building blocks by adroit linking of exergonic and endergonic processes. [SEP] A cell, or colony of cells, is propagating this organization of process. [SEP] My aim in the current chapter is to begin to investigate what we might mean, and hence see, by propagating organization. [SEP] No easy journey, this. [SEP] I will begin with Maxwell’s demon and why measurement of a system only pays in a nonequilibrium setting. [SEP] In a nonequilibrium setting, the measurements can be stored and used to extract work from the measured system. [SEP] Maxwell’s demon is the clearest place in physics where matter, energy, and information	come	together. [SEP] Yet, we will find the demon and his eorts at measurement tantalizingly incomplete: You see, only some features of a nonequilibrium system, if measured, reveal displacements from equilibrium from which work can, in principle, be extracted. [SEP] Other features, even if measured, are useless for detecting such energy sources from which work can be extracted. [SEP] Thus, whatever the demon’s eorts, there remain the issues of just what features of a nonequilibrium system the demon must measure such that work can be extracted, how the demon knows to measure those features rather than other useless features, and how, once measured, couplings	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
The universe as a whole  from galaxies to planetary systems, and certainly our and any other biospheres  is filled with entities that measure displacements from equilibrium that are sources of energy, those entities actually do extract work. [SEP] Think of the teeming busyness of a coevolving mixed microbial community of long ago, successfully linking exergonic and endergonic reactions fired by the sun and other high-energy sources. [SEP] That community measured displacements from equilibrium, extracted work, and inhabited Manhattan three billion years ago, literally building high-rise microbial mat ecosystems. [SEP] Its microbial descendants are constructing similar high-rise structures in the Sea of Cortez and on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia today. [SEP] Where did all this	come	from, this measuring of useful displacements from equilibrium from which work can be extracted, the devices coupling to such measurements, and the extraction of work used to build up new kinds of devices that measure new kinds of displacements from equilibrium to extract work in new ways? [SEP] Yet a biosphere, actually constructing itself up from sunlight, water, and a small diversity of chemical compounds, does all this over evolutionary time. [SEP] The biosphere does achieve persistent measuring of displacements from equilibrium from which work can be extracted and does discover “devices” to couple to those energy sources such that work can be extracted. [SEP] And since the biosphere does this, and the biosphere is part of the universe, then the universe does it.

And since the biosphere does this, and the biosphere is part of the universe, then the universe does it. [SEP] This coming into existence of self-constructing ecosystems must, somehow, be physics. [SEP] Thus, it is important that we have no theories for these issues in current physics.

A conceptual cluster lies at the heart of the mystery. [SEP] The cluster concerns the progressive emergence of organization in the evolution of the physical universe and of a biosphere. [SEP] That emerging organization concerns the appearance in the evolving universe of entities measuring relevant rather than nonrelevant properties of nonequilibrium systems, by which they identify sources of energy that can perform work. [SEP] Then physical entities appear that construct constraints on and couplings to the release of the identified source of energy whereby the energy is actually released and work	come	s to be performed. [SEP] Such work often	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
The heart of the mystery concerns a proper understanding of “organization” and “propagating, diversifying organization.” [SEP] Most profoundly, the mystery concerns the historical appearance since the big bang of connected structures of matter, energy, and processes by which an increasing diversity of kinds of matter, sources of energy, and types of processes	come	into existence in a biosphere, or in the universe itself. [SEP] This is what lies directly before us but which we have not been able to see. [SEP] A biosphere does all the above. [SEP] Ours has for four billion years of awesome, ill-understood creativity. [SEP] Doubt it? [SEP] Open your eyes and look around you. [SEP] The universe, since the big bang, was and remains out of equilibrium, or vastly nonequilibrium. [SEP] It was a profound insight in the development of equilibrium thermodynamics to recognize that the energy present in the thermal motions of an equilibrium gas system could not be extracted to do work. [SEP] But we might ask a similar question of the nearly featureless, profound nonequilibrium of the early universe. [SEP] How, in the absence of specific structures and processes, 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
More generally, Zurek’s point is that as measurements are performed on a nonequilibrium gas system, the length of the most compact description increases more slowly than the knowledge thus gained reduces the entropy of the system. [SEP] It pays to measure the nonequilibrium system in the sense that those measurements specify the displacements from equilibrium that constitute energy sources that can be utilized to extract work. [SEP] So the demon is indeed a place in physics where matter, energy, information, and indeed, work,	come	together. [SEP] Let’s consider just how work might actually be extracted in the classical Maxwell demon situation with an ideal gas in two boxes separated by a partition with the window and flap valve. [SEP] As a simple example, consider again the tiny windmill mentioned above, consisting of a fan and a vane perpendicular to the fan. [SEP] Let the windmill be located very near the window with the flap valve inside the total gas system. [SEP] If the flap valve is opened, a wind will pass transiently from the left to the right box. [SEP] The windmill’s vane will measure the direction of the wind and actually orient the windmill fan blades perpendicular to the wind. [SEP] The wind will cause the fan to turn, thus the turning fan extracts mechanical work from the system until equilibrium is rea	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
s in the left box is hotter than the gas in the right box. [SEP] Further, suppose the demon measures the number and instantaneous locations of all the gas particles in the left and right boxes. [SEP] The fact that the particles in the left box are hotter than those in the right box, hence are moving faster than those in the right box, would not be revealed by a measurement of the instantaneous numbers and locations of all the gas particles in the left and right boxes. [SEP] To measure faster motion, the demon must measure positions at two time moments or some other feature, such as the recoil of the box’s walls from the momentum transferred by the hotter versus cooler gas particles in the left and right boxes as they bounce o the wall. [SEP] So, just how does the demon decide (Figure .) or	come	to measure the relevant properties such that an energy source is successfully identified such that work can be extracted? [SEP] We have, in fact, no answer as yet.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
We see the hints here of something new. [SEP] Only certain features of a given nonequilibrium system, if measured, will result in detection of sources of energy that might be	come	coupled to specific other processes that, by doing work, propagate macroscopic changes in the universe. [SEP] Moreover, the tiny windmill is an example of a device that not only detects the wind from the left to the right box, but also orients the fan perpendicular to that wind and has couplings and constraints embodied in its structure such that mechanical work is actually extracted.

The universe as a whole has witnessed the coming into existence of novel structures and processes; so too has the biosphere. [SEP] Where no dierence existed, dierences have	come	into existence. [SEP] In a general sense, the persistent emergence of dierent structures and processes is the persistent breaking of the symmetry of the universe. [SEP] What feeds this apparent propagating diversity? [SEP] One aspect may be the following. [SEP] Consider again the case of the box with the flap valve and something simpler than a fan, say a small mica flake suspended in the cooler of the left and right boxes. [SEP] If the flap valve “be opened,” a wind from the hotter to the cooler box is transiently present. [SEP] This is a simple displacement from equilibrium, and a simple device, the mica flake, will be made to quake, hence, extract mechanical work. [SEP] Now consider an antiferromagnetic material. [SEP] Such material has magnetic dipoles that, when adjacent, prefer to poin	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
Now consider an antiferromagnetic material. [SEP] Such material has magnetic dipoles that, when adjacent, prefer to point in opposite directions. [SEP] The north pole of one prefers to be adjacent to the south poles of its neighbors. [SEP] If arranged along a straight line, an antiferromagnetic material has two equivalent lowest-energy “ground” states, NSNSNSNSN versus SNSNSNSNS. [SEP] Now consider a subtle displacement from one of these lowest-energy states, say NNNSNSSSN. [SEP] Here, rather than alternating N and S poles being next to one another, runs of NNN and SSS occur. [SEP] The energy of the total system would be lowered if the dipoles flipped orientation to	come	closer to one or the other of the ground energy states. [SEP] Therefore, at a suciently low temperature such that the system can flow to and remain at a ground state, the NNNSNSSSN antiferromagnet is displaced from its lowest-energy equilibrium state, and in principle, work could be extracted from this system as it relaxes to one of the two lowest-energy states. [SEP] But notice now that, compared to detecting the direction of the wind by the mica flake, a rather complex and subtle measurement must be made by any measuring device that is to detect the subtle displacement from equilibrium and that any device that is to use that displacement to extract work must be correspondingly subtle. [SEP] Roughly speaking, a measuring device must be of similar complexity to the antiferromagnet. [SEP] In	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] So the work done is given by just adding up little increments of the force acting on a mass and accelerating it through a distance. [SEP] But already there is a bit of a puzzle. [SEP] In any specific case of work done, some direction of application of force is specified in three-dimensional space, some actual direction of motion of the mass is specified in three-dimensional space, and some actual coupling mechanism is in place such that the force does act on the mass and get it to accelerate in that direction.

hat of ethics? [SEP] Does a whi of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents? [SEP] Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent. [SEP] There are deep reasons for caution. [SEP] Hume told us long ago about the “naturalistic fallacy”: One cannot deduce “ought” from “is.” [SEP] From the fact that mothers care for their young, we cannot deduce that they ought to do so, Hume argued. [SEP] From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry, we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so. [SEP] Indeed, Hume’s injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements. [SEP] We scientists find the facts. [SEP] You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics. [SEP] But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is, where do values	come	from at all? [SEP] Hume’s injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category “ought.” [SEP] The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long, twisted, arduous.

Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances. [SEP] “It is wrong to kill.” [SEP] Be	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1

It is important to stress an obvious feature of the biosphere, in contrast to the algorithmic computational systems of Fontana, Ray, and others.

[SEP] In contrast, the biosphere is built up of the doings, the embodied know-how, carryings on of autonomous agents = real physical molecular systems grafting a flow of matter and energy, constraint construction, and organization into their persistent coevolution.

It is precisely this point, that the function of a part of an organism is a subset of its causal consequences, to which I appealed earlier in stating that in an autonomous agent discerning the work task done by the constrained release of energy required finding the subset of causal consequences of that work task that were functionally important to the life cycle of the autonomous agent in its environment and, therefore, were presumably selected and sustained by natural selection. [SEP] My point was that we cannot know the functions of parts except in the context of the whole autonomous agent in its environment.

[SEP] Given that the universe is actually nonergodic, nonrepeating, and in macroscopically important ways, over a time scale vastly longer than the lifetime of the universe, we are entitled to broach the question of whether there might be general laws governing some or all aspects of this nonergodic behavior. [SEP] No one knows, but I will raise a possibility that has a chance to be true for a biosphere.

Let that sink in. [SEP] It would take at least to the th times the current lifetime of the universe for the universe to manage to make all possible proteins of length at least once. [SEP] Obviously, with respect to proteins of length the universe is vastly nonergodic. [SEP] It cannot have equilibrated over all these possible dierent molecules. [SEP] At a level of complexity above atomic nuclei, once into the realm of complex molecules, the universe will not, cannot,	come	to equilibrium, on vastly long timescales compared to its historical age. [SEP] Indeed, the giant cold molecular clouds in galaxies, about degrees absolute in temperature, are highly complex mixtures of molecular species, many carbonaceous, as well as the birthplace of stars. [SEP] We will return in a moment to wonder about whether a galaxy, considered as a closed thermodynamic system, reaches equilibrium chemically. [SEP] What about the arbitrary restriction to a femtosecond? [SEP] The fastest known timescale is the Planck timescale, one in to the rd parts of a second, or seconds. [SEP] At the Planck timescale, therefore, the universe can have created at most proteins of length compared to such proteins.

rom chemical equilibrium among a fixed set of molecular species damp out fairly rapidly. [SEP] By contrast, consider a giant cold molecular cloud in a spiral galaxy with about a hundred million solar masses; ignore gravitational eects and just consider the ongoing complex chemical reactions on the complex dust particles that exist in those clouds. [SEP] The specific molecular configurations that arise almost certainly include molecular species that are ever unique in the history of the universe. [SEP] If we may consider unique molecular species as macroscopic features of the cloud, then these fluctuations in macroscopic properties do not damp out; rather, they form the nexus for the generation of still new, unique molecular species. [SEP] A specific cloud, like our biosphere, presumably be	come	s kinetically trapped into a very special set of complex molecular species that happen to have formed as the cloud evolves.

ion is, say, one in a trillion, or , then the expected number of catalyzed reactions is just the product of the number of reactions times the number of potential protein catalysts, divided by the probability that a given protein catalyzes a given reaction. [SEP] This yields reactions times proteins divided by , which equals . [SEP] In short, virtually all possible reactions will be catalyzed by something. [SEP] Indeed, on average, each possible reaction will find dierent protein catalysts. [SEP] A vast sustained explosion into the adjacent possible would occur. [SEP] Ergo, the biosphere is supracritical. [SEP] More precisely, the biosphere would be supracritical if all molecular species could be in eective contact with one another on short timescales. [SEP] But all molecular species do not	come	in contact with one another willy-nilly, for molecular species are packaged into cells. [SEP] It is critical to note that individual cells are not supracritical. [SEP] The crude argument says that a cell’s metabolism has about organic molecules.

[SEP] Thus, addition of Q to the cell aords about novel reactions. [SEP] Let the protein diversity of the cell be bounded by the human number of genes at ,.

Candidate Laws for the Coconstruction of a Biosphere or the purpose of our discussion here, grant that molecular autonomous agents propagate organization and evolve by the roughly familiar Darwinian aegis of mutation and selection. [SEP] These agents  coevolving with one another, discovering displacements from equilibrium that can be used to accomplish work, making records of such sources of energy, then linking those exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions  are the means by which our biosphere has	come	into being, actually coconstructed by the activities, accidents, striving, and failures of these autonomous agents, exapting persistently into their adjacent possible. [SEP] Yes. [SEP] But how does a biosphere get itself constructed? [SEP] Are there laws? [SEP] Are there laws that might hold for any biosphere?

It may be that Welsh has found the first evidence of genes lying in eight dierent green islands, buered from one another by the percolating red frozen structure. [SEP] If the green islands exist, they are the paragraph structure of the genome. [SEP] They are the midsize decision-taking subcircuits of the genome. [SEP] For each such island, cut o from influence by other islands by the frozen red structure, has its own alternative attractors, two for this island, five for that island, seven for a third island. [SEP] The total number of attractors for the entire network is then x x = . [SEP] And if so, cell types are a kind of combinatorial code of the choices made by the dierent islands. [SEP] And yet more: My colleague Marc Ballivet, with a minor bit of help from me, has	come	up with a means to rapidly clone most or all cis sites from cells. [SEP] If the thousands of cis sites can be cloned, each can be used to anity purify the trans factors binding it. [SEP] Other biologists are learning how to construct small genetic circuits. [SEP] By our means or others, the medicine of the twenty-first century will learn to control the activities of genes in genetic networks, hence, control tissue regeneration and dierentiation. [SEP] We enter the “postgenomic” era. [SEP] I return to my candidate law and remark next that cells typically do not live alone; they live in communities of single-celled organisms or other simple multicellular organisms, or they live in tissues in highly complex multicellular organisms.

Consider an ecosystem with dierent species of bacteria. [SEP] Each species may secrete dierent chemical species, S, that impinge on a subset, C, of the other cell species. [SEP] In Figure . [SEP] I show a three-dimensional coordinate system. [SEP] One axis shows the order-chaos axis for a single isolated bacterium, measured by Derrida curve criteria, with order on the left, near the origin, and chaos on the right. [SEP] The remaining axes show C and S. If a given cell is at the phase transition between order and chaos, and additional molecular inputs, S per cell,	come	from C dierent types of cells, the total connectivity in the cell is raised from KN to KN + CS. [SEP] The results will typically drive that cell into the chaotic regime. [SEP] Indeed, the entire community will be driven into the chaotic regime. [SEP] Hence, in the coordinate system of Figure . [SEP] , Igor Yakushin at Bios Group has shown that a hyperbolic surface, as shown, separates the ordered regime from the chaotic regime. [SEP] Cells can buer themselves from chemical perturbations from other species by retreating deeper into the ordered regime.

[SEP] This can be accomplished by increasing the number of canalyzing inputs per gene. [SEP] And indeed, as described above, individual eukaryotic cells do appear to lie well within the ordered regime, perhaps as buering for the fact that such cells, like yeast, live in microbial communities or, like human cells, live in tissues where each cell is bombarded with chemical signals from other cells in the same body. [SEP] It is a plausible conjecture that communities of cells, and tissues,	come	to lie on the phase transition surface between order and chaos. [SEP] The hypothesis is readily tested. [SEP] If so, perturbations of a single gene in one type of cell should trigger a power law distribution of avalanches of changes of gene activities that spreads from the perturbed gene to other genes in that cell and species, and to cells of other species. [SEP] Further, the Derrida curve of the total community should be at the phase transition. [SEP] A final numerical test is under way. [SEP] The aim of the numerical test is to check whether cells and communities that lie at the phase transition would, in fact, make the maximum number of reliable discriminations and act without trembling hands.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
ants of rather dramatic eect, none more so than the famous homeotic mutants of Drosophila, which fascinated me and many others. [SEP] Here a single mutant can change an antenna into a leg or an eye to a wing or a head to the genitalia. [SEP] These survive perfectly well in the laboratory as well, but one expects would not fare well in the real world. [SEP] Therefore, most of the heritable variation cast up by mutation is of minor eect, and gradual variation is persistent grist for the selection mill. [SEP] Somehow, current organisms have contrived themselves to be such that most mutations are of minor eect. [SEP] But is it necessarily the case that all complex systems have the property that most mutations are of minor eect? [SEP] And if not, where does the gradualism of Darwinian selection	come	from? [SEP] Importantly, it is easy to create systems that are not readily adaptable by mutation and selection. [SEP] What follows is not quite a theorem (and was discussed in At Home in the Universe), but it will do. [SEP] Many of the readers of this book are competent programmers. [SEP] Consider a typical program, say written in C, Java, or some other language. [SEP] Perhaps it computes something as simple as the square roots of the first two million integers. [SEP] Perhaps it simulates an ecosystem. [SEP] Whatever that program does, imagine trying to evolve it by making random mutations in the code.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
It follows that only some complex systems can be assembled by an evolutionary process. [SEP] And it turns out that an evolutionary process based on mutation, recombination, and selection, the genetic search mechanisms of current life, does very well on a special kind of fitness landscape, where the high peaks tend to cluster near one another and the sides of the peaks are reasonably smooth, rather like the high Alps. [SEP] Then, as I first asked in chapter , where do such correlated fitness landscapes	come	from? [SEP] More generally, I recall the no-free-lunch theorem of Bill Macready and David Wolpert. [SEP] Macready and Wolpert wondered whether, averaged over all possible fitness landscapes, some search algorithms, such as mutation and selection, on average outperform all other search algorithms, such as random search on the landscape or hill descending or picking birthdays, taking their square, and jumping that distance in a randomly chosen direction. [SEP] The no-free-lunch theorem proves that, averaged over all landscapes, no search algorithm outperforms any other. [SEP] Well, my goodness!

And, as noted in chapter , those ways of making a living that set problems that are well searched out by the search mechanisms of organisms  mutation, recombination, and selection  will be well searched out. [SEP] Many sibling species will arise and lineages will branch. [SEP] There will be many species making livings and many cases of livings being made that are well searched out by the search mechanisms of organisms. [SEP] In short, there must be a self-consistent coconstruction of a biosphere in which organisms, ways of making a living, and search mechanisms jointly and self-consistently	come	into existence. [SEP] Organisms are not solving arbitrary problems. [SEP] We are solving the kinds of problems we can solve given our solution procedures. [SEP] How could it be otherwise? [SEP] So, somehow  and we will have to seek plausible mechanisms  organisms are tuning the statistical structure of the fitness landscapes they are searching in evolution. [SEP] But the problem is very much more complex than merely searching a fixed fitness landscape. [SEP] Fitness landscapes are not fixed.

 [SEP] In doing so, it shortchanges its proper domain.

[SEP] One of their examples of a “dated contingent good” is “ ton of wheat delivered in Chicago on May , , under the condition that the average rainfall in Nebraska for the six preceding months has been percent less than normal for the past fifty years and that the Boston Red Sox won the World Series the previous year.” [SEP] In the Arrow-Debreu theory, we are to imagine an auctioneer, who at a defined beginning of time, say, this morning, holds an auction covering all possible dated contingent goods. [SEP] All suppliers and customers gather at this imaginary auction, bidding ensues for all possible dated contingent goods, with values calculated under dierent hypotheses about the probabilities that the dierent dated contingencies will	come	about. [SEP] At the end of an imaginary hour of frantic bargaining, the auction closes. [SEP] All participants now have contracts to buy or sell all possible dated contingent goods, each at a fixed price.

extinction events. [SEP] We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. [SEP] And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera. [SEP] But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. [SEP] Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. [SEP] With the horse went the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. [SEP] With the car came paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. [SEP] The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. [SEP] One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction	come	in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. [SEP] More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? [SEP] Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. [SEP] Most firms die young, some last a long time. [SEP] We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions. [SEP] The parallels are at least tantalizing, and probably more than that. [SEP] While the mechanisms of heritable variation dier and the selection criteria dier, organisms in the biosphere and firms and individuals in the econosphere are busy trying to make a living and explore new ways of making a living.

rows and columns drawn on the plastic below to guide your experimental hands. [SEP] Arrange the rows, numbered to to correspond to blue bacteria secreting to molecules a second. [SEP] Arrange the columns, numbered to to correspond to the red bacteria secreting to molecules a second. [SEP] Into each of the x cells on your square petri plate, place exactly one red and one blue bacterium with the corresponding secretion rates. [SEP] Thus, in the upper left, bacteria that are low blue and low red secretors are coplated onto each square. [SEP] On the lower left, high blue and low red secretors are coplated. [SEP] On the upper right, low blue and high red secretors are coplated. [SEP] And in the lower right corner, high red and high blue bacteria are coplated. [SEP] Go for lunch, and dinner, and	come	back the next day. [SEP] In general, among the , coplated pairs of bacteria, while all , colonies will have grown, a single pair will have grown to the largest mixed red-blue bacterial colony. [SEP] Say the largest mixed red-blue colony corresponds to red secreting molecules per second, blue secreting molecules per second. [SEP] This gedankenexperiment is important, for the exchange ratio of red and blue molecules is the analogue of price, the ratio of trading of oranges for apples. [SEP] And there exists a ratio, red molecules to blue molecules per second, that maximizes the growth of the mixed red-blue bacterial colony. [SEP] Since the fastest growing mixed red-blue colony will exponentially outgrow all others and dominate our gedankenexperiment petri plate, this red-blue pair establishes	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
 mixed colony are replicating at the identical optimum rate. [SEP] As discussed in chapter , using a rough mapping of biology to economics, that rate of replication of a bacterium corresponds to economic utility and the increased the rate of replication corresponds to increased economic utility. [SEP] The red and blue bacteria not only establish price, but they also share equally the advantages of trade present along the Pareto-ecient contract curve in the Edgeworth box discussed in chapter . [SEP] Mutualists in the biosphere have been hacking out rough price equilibria for millions of years and have done so without foresight and without the Arrow-Debreu fixed-point theorems. [SEP] Indeed, critters have been hacking out rough price equilibria even as exaptations and new ways of living have	come	into existence and old ways have perished. [SEP] Presumably, these rough biological price equilibria are reached because in the short and intermediate term they optimize the fitness of both of the mutualists. [SEP] And the markets clear, in the sense that all the red molecules are exchanged for blue molecules per second. [SEP] But it’s a self-organized critical world out there, with small and large avalanches of speciation and extinction events in the biosphere and econosphere, and equilibrium price or no, most species and technologies, job holders and jobs, are no longer among us to mumble about advantages of trade.

Because the total utility to the consumer is a simple sum of the discounted utilities of all the possible goods in the economy, finding the optimal plan at any period is just a linear programming problem, and the results are a fixed ratio of construction activities of all the objects produced at that period. [SEP] The fixed ratio of the activities is the mirror of price, relative to one good, taken as the arbitrary “currency,” or “numeraire.” [SEP] Over time, the model economy ticks forward. [SEP] At each period, in general, only some of the possible goods and services are constructed. [SEP] The others do not make the consumer happy enough. [SEP] Over time, new goods and services	come	into existence, and old ones go out of existence in small and large avalanches of speciation and extinction events. [SEP] Thus, a grammar model, or a physical instantiation of a grammar model such as Lego World, is a toy world with a technology graph of objects and transformations. [SEP] With the addition of utilities to the dierent objects for one consumer or a set of consumers and a social planner  or more generally, with a set of utilities for the objects that may dier among consumers and with dierent costs and scaling of costs with sizes of production runs of dierent Lego objects  a market economy can be constructed.

It all hangs on object-oriented programming. [SEP] A case in point is the recent advent of Java, an object-based language, which, as of February had a library of some eighty thousand Java objects. [SEP] Goodness knows how fast this library of objects is growing. [SEP] Among the Java objects are “carburetor” objects, “engine block” objects, and “piston” objects, and objects	come	with “functional” descriptors, such as “is a,” “has a,” “does a,” “needs a,” “uses a.” [SEP] Both implicitly and, with modest work, explicitly, the “piston” object can discover that it fits into the cylinder hole in the “engine block” object to create a completed piston in a cylinder. [SEP] The “carburetor” object can discover that it is to be located on top of the “engine block” object, connected to certain “gas line” objects in certain ways.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
And still more.

iverged from one another in the evolutionary record, the more amino acid mutations distinguish the hemoglobins of the two species involved. [SEP] Our hemoglobin is very similar to chimp hemoglobin and quite dierent from the whale. [SEP] So good is this correlation that, within given protein families, it is argued that mutations accumulate with timelike clockwork, hence the molecular clock hypothesis, in which a number of amino acid dierences can be taken as a surrogate for time from the most common ancestor. [SEP] Dierent protein family clocks seem to run at dierent rates. [SEP] There is evidence that the clock does not run quite smoothly.

[SEP] I agree and suggest that the near accuracy of the molecular clock data over hundreds of millions of years and virtually all species strongly suggests that the biosphere has coconstructed itself such that species, even as they speciate and go extinct, are, as lineages, in the persistently survivable regime.

[SEP] Bryant Park also offers distant views of two of Manhattan’s most distinctive skyscrapers: the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. [SEP] The Chrysler Building started life as a speculative office building.

 cannot be explained by functional or structural requirements, since the pointed arch provides only marginal structural advantages; and round-arch technology is perfectly capable of building tall naves, as Durham Cathedral and other magnificent Romanesque churches demonstrate.

modity, firmness, and delight into his particular version of balance; how to attach the travertine to the wall to create a particular effect; which metal fabricator could make a certain kind of handrail; and exactly how deep to make a window mullion to cast the right size of shadow. [SEP] Buildings are extremely complicated artifacts, and the time necessary to cultivate and refine a particular manner of building cannot be underestimated. [SEP] This is especially true when the manner of building is personal or unusual, as it was in the case of both Furness and Rudolph. [SEP] They were not simply being stubborn or high-minded when they refused to adapt to changing fashions, they were being realistic. [SEP] Morris Lapidus is an architect who has lived long enough to see architectural fashions	come	full circle. [SEP] In the 1950s, Lapidus designed many of the largest hotels in the Miami area: the Fontainebleau, the Americana, the Eden Roc. [SEP] His flamboyant, eclectic designs were ridiculed by the architectural establishment, although they were popular with the public. [SEP] Today, in a period of so-called entertainment architecture, when the world’s most celebrated architects design theme parks and casinos, Lapidus seems less like a maverick than a pioneer.

We believe such statements do not reflect an adequate appreciation of the FAA's responsibility for the safety and security of civil aviation. [SEP] The airlines bore responsibility, too. [SEP] They were facing an escalating number of conflicting and, for the most part, erroneous reports about other flights, as well as a continuing lack of vital information from the FAA about the hijacked flights. [SEP] We found no evidence, however, that American Airlines sent any cockpit warnings to its aircraft on 9/11. [SEP] United's first decisive action to notify its airborne aircraft to take defensive action did not	come	until 9:19, when a United flight dispatcher, Ed Ballinger, took the initiative to begin transmitting warnings to his 16 transcontinental flights: "Beware any cockpit intrusion- Two a/c [aircraft] hit World Trade Center." [SEP] One of the flights that received the warning was United 93. [SEP] Because Ballinger was still responsible for his other flights as well as Flight 175, his warning message was not transmitted to Flight 93 until 9:23. [SEP] By all accounts, the first 46 minutes of Flight 93's cross-country trip proceeded routinely. [SEP] Radio communications from the plane were normal. [SEP] Heading, speed, and altitude ran according to plan. [SEP] At 9:24, Ballinger's warning to United 93 was received in the cockpit.

[SEP] The heading of the Langley fighters was adjusted to send them to the Baltimore area. [SEP] The mission crew commander explained to us that the purpose was to position the Langley fighters between the reported southbound American 11 and the nation's capital. [SEP] At the suggestion of the Boston Center's military liaison, NEADS contacted the FAA's Washington Center to ask about American 11. [SEP] In the course of the conversation, a Washington Center manager informed NEADS:"We're looking- we also lost American 77." [SEP] The time was 9:34. [SEP] This was the first notice to the military that American 77 was missing, and it had	come	by chance. [SEP] If NEADS had not placed that call, the NEADS air defenders would have received no information whatsoever that the flight was even missing, although the FAA had been searching for it. [SEP] No one at FAA headquarters ever asked for military assistance with American 77. [SEP] At 9:36, the FAA's Boston Center called NEADS and relayed the discovery about an unidentified aircraft closing in on Washington:"Latest report. Aircraft VFR [visual flight rules] six miles southeast of the White House. . . . Six, southwest. Six, southwest of the White House, deviating away." [SEP] This startling news prompted the mission crew commander at NEADS to take immediate control of the airspace to clear a flight path for the Langley fighters:"Okay, we're going to turn it . . . crank it up. . . . 	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5

[SEP] It’s a refreshing spot, perfect for a picnic as well as sailing and windsurfing. [SEP] Lagoa, a sizeable town east of Portimão, is the province’s wine capital. [SEP] The acidic vinhos da casa served in most restaurants on the Algarve	come	from here. [SEP] Lagoa wine, both red and white, is more powerful than ordinary wine, and the extra degree or two of alcoholic content can creep up on you. [SEP] The local tourist office can arrange tours of wineries and tastings (Adega de Cooperativa de Lagoa; Tel. 282/342 181; 24 hours in advance). [SEP] New golf courses are being built in the area, but there’s little else to detain visitors. [SEP] From Lagoa, turn south about 5 km (3 miles) to the charming resort of Carvoeiro, an archetypal small Barlavento resort.

xtraordinary displays of azulejo design you’ll ever see. [SEP] Every square inch of the Baroque, 15th-century church — its walls, vaulted ceiling, and cupola — is covered with hand-painted, blue-and-white ceramic tiles. [SEP] Most date from the early 18th century and depict biblical scenes detailing the life of St. Lawrence, born across the border in Huesca, Spain. [SEP] The only element of the church not blue-and-white is the carved, gilded altar. [SEP] The ensemble is a stunning sight, not to be missed. [SEP] Loulé, north of Almancil, is a regional produce center with a large Saturday market, known for its leather, lace, and copper goods. [SEP] Loulé is a prosperous town with an ambitious, modern boulevard complete with outdoor cafés that are jam-packed on market day. [SEP] Coach parties	come	from far and wide to shop at the colorful, bustling market. [SEP] There are actually two markets. [SEP] Fresh produce, including fish, is sold in a mock-Moorish hall, while a “gypsy market” is held towards the opposite end of the boulevard. [SEP] Just below the permanent market halls, on the main Praça da República, you’ll find a well-preserved section of the medieval castle walls (which were much damaged by the 1755 earthquake). [SEP] The ramparts afford excellent views from the town, and set into the castle remains is a modest local museum. [SEP] Also worth visiting are the Igreja Matriz (São Clemente), a 13th-century Gothic church with 18th-century azulejo tiles; the Convento da Graça, with a terrific Manueline portal; and Ermida de Nossa Senhora da Conceição, a small church prized for i	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
The Sotavento Coast Heading east from the provincial capital of Faro, the first settlement of any size you will	come	to is the colorful fishing town of Olhão. [SEP] A working port, it has made few concessions to tourism and is full of character. [SEP] Olhão has often been described as the “little white Cubist town of the Algarve,” its architecture likened to that of North African towns. [SEP] That may have been the case some years ago, but modern development has strongly interfered with its once distinctive appearance. [SEP] You can judge for yourself by ascending the bell tower of the parish church (which also goes by the name of Nossa Senhora do Rosário), which you will find by winding your way through the narrow streets back to the Praça da Restauração (you may have to ask for access to the tower in the sacristy).

[SEP] This tuna-fishing port and self-assured town of historic churches, imposing classical-style mansions, and riverfront gardens probably dates back as far as the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians. [SEP] In fact, its seven-arched stone bridge of Roman origin is still in use.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
At ground level, seedy or amusing ( depending on your point of view) shops sell sex wares, attracting customers from all walks of life; but don’t get too distracted, else you’ll miss the rows of dainty gables, quirky wall plaques, and window boxes brimming with flowers, which give the whole area a cheery feel. [SEP] Don’t be surprised to find offices, shops, and restaurants living side by side with the brothels here — it’s all part of Amsterdam life. [SEP] At night the streets	come	alive with bars, clubs, and adult shows. [SEP] It is one of liveliest parts of the city after dark.

[SEP] Following the Alteration in 1578 Catholics were not permitted to practice their religion, and Hartman — along with a number of other wealthy Catholics of the time — had a secret chapel built, where his family and friends could worship.

ion is housed in a magnificent Victorian Gothic building, especially designed for it by P. J. H. Cuypers, which was opened in 1885. [SEP] The museum can be a confusing maze of connecting rooms — additions were completed in 1898 and 1919 — so it pays to sit down for a few minutes to study the very comprehensive map, which accompanies your ticket. [SEP] A multimedia interactive study area also allows you to review the vast collection on a screen, pinpoint works which you want to see, and print out further details of each piece. [SEP] The center, called ARIA (Amsterdam Rijksmuseum InterActief), is located in room 225, behind the Night Watch room. [SEP] You can also take advantage of an audio CD tour to give you background detail as you explore. [SEP] The collection is varied but most visitors	come	to see the works of the Dutch masters. [SEP] Dutch painting of the 15th to 17th centuries are to be found in rooms 201 to 236 on the second floor. [SEP] Among the collection are 20 works by Rembrandt, including The Nightwatch, properly entitled The Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq and Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch. [SEP] The work, which was commissioned by the company for its barracks, is remarkable for its lack of formality and very different from the accepted style of the day. [SEP] Johannes Vermeer (1632–1675) is also well-represented, and his effective use of light can be clearly seen in The Kitchen Maid, painted in 1660, which is one of the gallery’s best-loved pieces.

A Brief History In ancient Greek mythology Athens is named following a contest between Athena, goddess of wisdom, and Poseidon, god of the sea. [SEP] Both had their eye on the prize real estate, so it was agreed that whoever could	come	up with the more useful gift for mortals would win. [SEP] The half-human, half-serpent king of Athens, Cecrops, acted as arbiter. [SEP] First came Poseidon, who struck the rock of the Acropolis with his mighty trident and brought salt water gushing forth. [SEP] Then it was Athena’s turn. [SEP] As she struck the rock an olive tree appeared, which proved more useful and valuable. [SEP] Thus she acquired the position of the city’s special protector.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
For almost 50 years after Platae, peace reigned at home, and the victorious city-state entered its most brilliant era. [SEP] Athens was instrumental in bringing the disparate Aegean and mainland communities together, creating a “league of nations”, known as the Delian League. [SEP] The headquarters of the League was originally on the island of Delos but it was moved to Athens itself in 454 b.c. The resources of the treasury of the Delian League were used — among other things — to build the Parthenon and other monuments that still adorn the Acropolis today. [SEP] The moving power behind this unrivaled time of greatness, which has	come	to be known as the Golden Age, was Pericles. [SEP] This liberal-inclined aristocrat was, in effect, the supreme ruler of Athens and its empire for 30 years until his death in 429 b.c. Great works of art, literature, science, and philosophy were produced by what Pericles referred to as the “school of Hellas.” [SEP] Major names of the time included the dramatists Euripides and Sophocles, the historian Herodotus, the philosopher Socrates, and the brilliant scientists Zeno and Anaxagoras. [SEP] The first literary salon in history was presided over by Aspasia, Pericles’ mistress, a remarkable woman of intelligence and spirit.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
Athenians understand this. [SEP] They are not daunted or downhearted by their surroundings, they enjoy their city, revelling in the opportunities it gives them. [SEP] Every district has its own small squares with cafés, where people gather for a drink or meal — and Athenians love to eat out. [SEP] You’ll be surprised at the wealth of good restaurants offering international cuisine, and how much post-modernist décor influences interior design in the smarter districts. [SEP] Of course the Greek taverna hasn’t be	come	extinct. [SEP] Locals as much as visitors enjoy the fresh and delicious cuisine that’s been served in Greece for centuries. [SEP] Greek theater is thriving at new auditoria such as the Megaron complex, or at the open-air theaters on Lycabettus Hill. [SEP] The annual Athens Festival has a full program of music, dance, and poetry with a rich historical legacy. [SEP] Sports are still avidly followed, though today it’s more likely to be football, not a discus throw, that excites the emotions. [SEP] Powerboat racing out on the waters of the Saronic Gulf also raises the adrenalin of the wealthy. [SEP] Tradition still plays an important part in daily life here.

Spectator Sports Football (soccer): Football is a national obsession for the Greeks and Athens’ teams (Panathanaikos and AEK Athens) feature prominently in domestic and European competitions.

Statuary: If you want a little piece of ancient Greece then you’ll certainly be able to find it. [SEP] It will be a reproduction of course — but still you can own your own copy of Zeus, Poseidon, or Athena herself, small enough to grace a table or large enough to decorate a garden. [SEP] Plaques depicting ancient friezes, or masks to hang on walls are also extremely popular, as are Mycenaean helmets. [SEP] If classical statuary is too ornate for your taste, you can also find copies of the minimalist Mycenaean statues found at the Goulandris Museum. [SEP] The National Archaeological Museum also has a wide range of copies of its artifacts. [SEP] Each	come	s with a certificate of authentication.

[SEP] When you have explored the architectural delights of the Acropolis, take time to enjoy the views from its walls. [SEP] Sections of the stone defences date back to Mycenaean times, though the majority were constructed during the first millennium and were reinforced by the Turks. [SEP] From the north you can take in the other major archaeological sites and the district of Plaka directly below. [SEP] From the east the verdant slopes of Mount Lycabettus	come	into view, with the smart district of Kolonaki on its lower slopes. [SEP] South leads the eye towards the coast and the islands of the Saronic Gulf. [SEP] As you leave the site via the smooth stone path through the Propylaia you’ll pass the Monument of Agrippa. [SEP] Originally erected with a single chariot to commemorate victory in the Panathenaic Games, a second chariot group including Marcus Agrippa was added in 27 b.c. You’ll leave through the Beulé Gate, a remaining part of the Roman defensive system.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
To the west of the Acropolis stands another small range of hills now cut by footpaths and covered in trees offering cooling shade in the heat of summer. [SEP] This area, reached by crossing Odós Rovertou Gali and walking up behind the Dionysus restaurant, offers splendid views across to the Acropolis (it’s the best place for afternoon overviews), and the Sound and Light Show auditorium is located here for this reason. [SEP] Several archaeological sites can be seen and the area is much less crowded than the Acropolis itself. [SEP] You’ll also see the 16th century church, Ayios Dimítrios Loumbardhi, nestling under the woodland canopy. [SEP] In the northeastern area, you’ll	come	to the Hill of the Pnyx, meeting place of the Assembly of Athens. [SEP] Loosely translated, pnyx means “crowded or tightly packed place,” and in ancient times this was a highly populated area. [SEP] You’ll see the outlines of walls, including the defensive Themistoklean Wall, between the bushes or under the turf as you stroll. [SEP] The Pnyx meeting place can be found below the summit on the northeastern side of the hill.

quaysides in the Main Harbor cater to hundreds of ferries large and small, and you’ll see fleets of large container ships laying anchor offshore. [SEP] Walking south along the quaysides brings you to a small shady square with the Cathedral of Agia Triada on its northern flank. [SEP] Take this street (Dimokratias) to the Town Hall and visit the lively daily market that takes place in the surrounding streets. [SEP] Take a right down Lampraki to reach the pretty harbor of Zea. [SEP] This is one of the marinas used for pleasure craft, and where Athenians — rich and not so rich — moor their boats. [SEP] These range from simple rowing boats of just a few feet in length to hundred-foot ocean-going vessels.

Paintings and art work with scenes of everyday life also make beautiful mementos. [SEP] The work of a number of artists, including Alton Lowe and Eddie Minnis, is becoming very collectable and prices can be high. [SEP] On the other end of the scale, street art, including things like driftwood paintings, can be fun and much more affordable. [SEP] Wood carvings are made from a variety of native trees. [SEP] Some of the best are made from the lignum vitae, the Bahamian national tree, and from the wild tamarind. [SEP] The carvings	come	in a bewildering variety, though animal and fish motifs seem to predominate. [SEP] Always check a piece thoroughly before you buy as they are vary in quality.

 paradise for sailors. [SEP] Safe harbors with superb facilities, cozy coves for a night alone, and the possibility of making short hops to a different port every night allow sailors to experience all the different atmospheres of the various islands. [SEP] On many of the islands, renting a boat is as easy as renting a car is in other destinations — especially on the more populated Out Islands. [SEP] Rentals can vary from small runabouts that will get you around the harbor and the coastal shallows to large sailing yachts and motor launches for inter-island expeditions. [SEP] Rates vary enormously. [SEP] To make more of a stay in the Abacos or Exumas, where there are many outlaying cays, you can rent a 18-ft (51⁄2-m) boat with small outboard motor for around $80 per day. [SEP] Larger vessels	come	with a crew and/or guide; if you sail your own boat, you can take advantage of the services of a local guide to take you to fishing, snorkeling, or dive sites. [SEP] The Abacos are most popular spot for sailing, primarily because of the many sheltered harbors and the many islands and cays that you can reach without having to go outside of the reefs and into ocean waters. [SEP] If you want to get out and see a lot of boats without doing any sailing, head to the Bahamas during the Regattas, when boats crowd the harbors and the little towns are full of yachtsmen. [SEP] Listen to the stories of heroic deeds in the bars and enjoy the wonderful views of masts filling the skies.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhatToDo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
alk. [SEP] For many years this has been the showcase for Bahamian handicrafts. [SEP] Straw goods, including baskets and mats, are favorite souvenirs; each island produces straw goods in its own style and patterns. [SEP] Bestsellers are hats, dolls, bags, and baskets. [SEP] There is some exquisite work to be found, but be aware that with a decline in basket-making throughout the Bahamas, an increasing number of articles are imported from the Far East; most of these are at the cheaper end of the scale. [SEP] The ubiquitous modern souvenir, the T-shirt, is also available, with an almost limitless number of pictures, patterns, and slogans. [SEP] The ladies who run the stalls are easy-going and seem to have limitless enthusiasm for the next sale. [SEP] You’ll hear numerous calls of “Hey, honey,	come	look for something nice here.” [SEP] The straw market fronts onto Bay Street, one of the leading duty-free shopping capitals of the world. [SEP] Only a few years ago this street was the domain of the Bay Street Boys, a small group of men who controlled all economic activity in the Bahamas; now Bay Street seduces visitors with huge sparkling gems, hundreds of ounces of gold, and the smell of a thousand designer fragrances. [SEP] The façades of the pretty 18th-century shops hide modern air-conditioned shopping palaces piled high with luxury goods.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
t bad weather and attack from invaders. [SEP] Its recent history is fascinating: In the 1930s it was owned by Swedish millionaire Axel Wenner-Gren, an arms manufacturer who was found to be a Nazi sympathizer. [SEP] He sold the island to Huntingdon Hartford, who changed the name from Hog to Paradise and created a beautiful private retreat, now the Ocean Club Hotel. [SEP] Later gangster Per Lansky began the process that transformed the island from a private sanctuary with magnificent homes into a playground for tourists. [SEP] The wonderful beaches, such as Cabbage Beach on the northern coast, were the focus of the development. [SEP] The first hotels began to appear in the 1960s when gambling was a lure to the rich and famous. [SEP] As Paradise Island saw owners Donald Trump and Merv Griffin	come	and go, it went through a continuing series of developments and re-developments. [SEP] Today Paradise Island may be close to fulfilling the dream of the perfect vacation playground. [SEP] It has many of the essential ingredients needed: fine white-sand beaches, a protected marina, a golf course, a group of fine hotels, and perhaps the biggest adult playground this side of Las Vegas. [SEP] The brainchild of the Sol Group, Atlantis Paradise Island is a new concept in resorts — it’s a huge hotel with an amazing theme park and entertainment village all on one site. [SEP] The resort takes its name, and inspiration, from the lost city of Atlantis, said by some to lie off the coast of Bimini. [SEP] This theme runs throughout the whole resort.

[SEP] A number of colorful shacks line the approach road where you can buy conch and fried fish, always fresh and always delicious. [SEP] Weekends can be busy with local families. [SEP] Travel through Arawak Cay to reach Silver Cay, where there is a small resort with a pretty beach. [SEP] Here you will find Crystal Cay, site of a marine park where you can take a close look at the undersea world without getting wet. [SEP] A man-made coral reef has been created on the sea bottom and you can watch all the marine activity from an underwater observatory. [SEP] The reef attracts many kinds of aquatic creatures that are free to	come	and go as they please. [SEP] The observatory looks decidedly futuristic and can be seen quite clearly from the road as you travel along the coast. [SEP] Other activities at Crystal Cay include a sea turtle environment, a touch pool where you can stroke a sting ray or pet a conch, and a snorkel trail, if you want to get into the water yourself. [SEP] A little further west along the coast you will find Cable Beach, the third main center of tourism on New Providence. [SEP] Several luxury hotels line the shore, only 5 minutes by car from central Nassau. [SEP] The Nassau Marriott Resort Hotel attracts many visitors with its casino, stage shows, and restaurants.

ive Port Lucaya marina gives the whole resort a very nautical feel. [SEP] A number of large hotels line the Lucayan Beach, their massive façades softened by the hundreds of masts of the yachts moored on the inlet. [SEP] As of late 1999, the casinos and many of the hotels were being given a facelift and three of the larger hotels on the waterfront were being reconfigured into a single complex. [SEP] Port Lucaya Marketplace is the center of all activity for the town. [SEP] During the day the duty-free shops in this Mediterranean-style shopping village tempt shoppers with jewelry, clothing, and perfume; colorful wooden huts house craft stalls selling straw work and carvings. [SEP] As the sun sinks people gather at the marketplace after a day on the beach or sailing offshore. [SEP] The streets	come	alive as bars and restaurants fill up and bands play live music at the Count Basie Bandstand in a square adjoining the marina. [SEP] On the south side of the marina, accessible from the main beach road, is the Underwater Explorers Society or UNEXSO. [SEP] The oldest diving organization in the Bahamas, UNEXSO provides diving experience sessions and training courses. [SEP] The large square building contains a diving pool and decompression chamber; those with no interest in actually practicing the sport can visit the museum, which charts the development of diving to the modern SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) method developed by Jacques Cousteau in the 1930s. [SEP] There is also a good restaurant on site, the Brass Helmet.

As you head east out of town you’ll soon leave the trappings of modernity behind and find yourself on a good road through acres of Bahamian forest. [SEP] The road crosses a number of canals, and just off the south coast is Petersons Cay, a tiny but beautiful coral cay with a beach — a great spot for a day of swimming, snorkeling, sunbathing, and picnicking. [SEP] After traveling approximately 10 miles on the main road you’ll	come	to Lucaya National Park (there’s a small parking lot on your left). [SEP] The 40-acre (16-hectare) park sits on both sides of the main road and protects a range of Bahamian ecosystems. [SEP] Inland, trails lead to one of the largest surveyed cave systems in the world, much of which lies underwater. [SEP] Ben’s Cave, also known as Bats Cave for reasons that will be obvious when you enter, is the most accessible and in fact rather small. [SEP] It links to the larger caves through subterranean tunnels. [SEP] The pool in the bottom has layers of fresh water lying on top of salt water. [SEP] Remains of several Lucayan Indians that were found at the cave entrance are now being studied in Nassau. [SEP] The caves are also home to a rare species of crustacean, spelonectes Lucayensis, which is said t	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
rricane and today you pass over the still dramatic gap from north to central Eleuthera on the man-made Glass Window Bridge. [SEP] The bridge requires continual maintenance because storms, hurricanes, high winds, and heavy seas take a constant toll; in turbulent weather the Atlantic rises in great waves pushing towards the still, calm Caribbean. [SEP] The first settlement after Glass Window Bridge is Gregory Town, a pretty hillside community of colorful houses overlooking a tiny harbor. [SEP] This is the capital of pineapple production in the Bahamas. [SEP] Try the fresh pies from Thompson’s Bakery on the top of a hill east of the harbor. [SEP] Halfway down the island is Governor’s Harbour, a photogenic town set on the sheltered eastern coastline. [SEP] It is a major center for sailors, who	come	here to stock up on all the essentials, obtain spare parts, and have repairs done. [SEP] Windermere Island, just off the east coast, was once the place to be in the Bahamas, but its smart resort hotel is now closed. [SEP] Jacques Cousteau had a home here and used it as a base for exploring the seas around the other Bahamian islands.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
The family of Neville Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister who attempted to negotiate with Hitler before World War II, created a sisal farm on the island, but the attempt failed miserably. [SEP] Andros is famed for its natural attractions: It has the third longest barrier reef in the world, lying just one mile (11⁄2 km) offshore and stretching 140 miles (225 km) down the east coast. [SEP] This makes it a popular destination with divers who	come	to explore the tidal shallows, the reef, and the deep reef walls, which plunge 6,000 ft (1,829 m) down into the Tongue of the Ocean, the deep passage between Andros and New Providence.

The island itself also has peculiarities that separate it from other Bahamian Islands. [SEP] It is the most undulating of the islands; one could even call it hilly, with the highest point of land in the Commonwealth, Mount Alvernia, rising to the heady heights of 216 ft (66m) above sea level. [SEP] Many visitors	come	to this island, named after an English sea captain called Catt, for its beautiful quiet beaches. [SEP] Fernandez Bay, with its arc of fine sand on the protected western side of the island, is said to be the finest in the Bahamas, and the nearby beach at Old Bight is not far behind in terms of beauty. [SEP] Though you can’t go wrong anywhere on the western coast. [SEP] Mount Alvernia, in the center of the island, is not far from the airfield at New Bight.

The interior of San Salvador is dotted with lakes; there is a great deal of marshy land and only one major road. [SEP] Cockburn Town (pronounced “KOE-burn”) is the capital. [SEP] Pride of place in the town goes to the small jail found by the main coast road. [SEP] It’s now a museum because, as one resident said, “we don’t have no need for no jail.” (The opening hours are irregular.) The main road leads around the circumference of the island. [SEP] Heading south from Cockburn Town you’ll first	come	to Long Bay, the “official” site of Columbus’s landing. [SEP] It is marked by a plain white cross that sits bright and stark against the azure-blue ocean on the seaward side of the road. [SEP] The area has been designated as Landfall Park. [SEP] Another monument, to the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, sits a little way from the cross. [SEP] This depiction of the Olympic rings on a circular plinth is here because the Olympic flame was brought to San Salvador on its way to Mexico. [SEP] At the northeastern corner of the island is Dixon Hill Lighthouse. [SEP] Built in 1856 but improved in subsequent years, it is called the last hand-operated kerosene-powered lighthouse in the Bahamas. [SEP] Its beam can be seen for some 20 miles (32 km).	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Walt Disney World They call it the “happiest place on earth,” which may be why more visitors now	come	here than to any other single attraction anywhere. [SEP] Surprisingly, four of every five are adults.

[SEP] The heart of the complex is the 100-acre (40-hectare) Magic Kingdom, where it’s easy to confuse who’s real and who’s artificial. [SEP] This is where the park began and where you can meet all your favorite Disney characters — you’ll be able to shake hands with Mickey and get a hug from Goofy.

oup of army conspirators, who claimed they acted to prevent a possible coup against Sukarno, kidnapped and killed six army generals. [SEP] In the following days, General Suharto, one of the most senior surviving commanders, isolated the conspirators and effectively seized power. [SEP] The blame for the killings was pinned on the Communist Party, the PKI, which denied any involvement. [SEP] A pogrom was then unleashed, first in Java and next in Bali, with widespread killings of suspected Communists. [SEP] The Chinese minority, mainly shopkeepers, moneylenders, and other small businesspeople, were also a target. [SEP] In common with the other immigrant groups, they had been compelled by law to display the flag of their country of origin, even if a century had passed since their ancestors had	come	to Indonesia. [SEP] Throughout Indonesia, every Chinese business, marked by the flag of China, and associated in people’s minds with communism, was attacked. [SEP] The numbers killed will never be known: in Bali alone the total casualties may have exceeded 60,000. [SEP] Sukarno’s association with the PKI led to his being forced to yield most of his powers. [SEP] Only his honored role in the independence struggle saved him from trial.

plexity. [SEP] Java is the source of the batik for dresses and sarongs sold in fashion shops; Balinese versions are usually much coarser. [SEP] Hawkers will swear that their dress lengths of cheap printed cotton are batik. [SEP] It’s easy to tell that they are not: Printed patterns don’t penetrate fully to the other side, while the real batik will show thin veins of color where the dye runs along tiny cracks in the wax (printed versions may try to simulate this). [SEP] Real batik is always much more expensive. [SEP] Used batik sarongs are highly prized, as their patterns are often no longer produced. [SEP] Used batik can be bought for very low fixed prices at textile shops like Alec, on Jalan Legian in Kuta-Legian. [SEP] Endek or ikat fabrics, using threads dyed in patterns before weaving,	come	from Gianyar in Bali as well as other Indonesian islands. [SEP] In Bali, only the weavers of Tenganan make grinsing, or double ikat, using pattern-dyed threads for both warp and weft. [SEP] The genuine fabric is justifiably expensive — beware of fakes! [SEP] You can find bold, primitive examples of ikat cloth, especially from islands such as Sumba, Flores, and Timor, in good textile shops. [SEP] Paintings: If you want a unique work of art, you’ll need to study the field. [SEP] Visit the major collections to judge the standard of the best paintings, especially the Neka Museum and Museum Puri Lukisan in Ubud (see page 41) as well as the Arts Centre in Denpasar (see page 37).

[SEP] You will cut traveling time and get to know different areas of Bali in depth if you make overnight stays or visits of a few days in each of the island’s regions. [SEP] Don’t expect—and don’t even try—to rush around seeing all the temples and other cultural attractions on the island, or all those mentioned in this section. [SEP] The island scenery and fleeting glimpses of everyday life are just as rewarding. [SEP] Best of all is to turn a corner and find a procession, perhaps the whole population of a village, dressed in their best and blocking the road.

[SEP] Towards sunset, a golden light reflects off the sea and local people	come	out to stroll or paddle in the shallows. [SEP] Young men play soccer on the sand or join the tourists in a volleyball game, while the eager beach masseuses rustle up a new wave of business. [SEP] At nightfall, new choices beckon.

[SEP] There’s a wide choice of accommodations, ranging from cheap homestays and charming middle range hotels to high-priced luxury hideaways in the countryside just outside Ubud. [SEP] Day trippers only get to see the commercialism and chaos in Ubud’s main streets. [SEP] Just a short walk away, however, you’re among the green, peaceful rice terraces and jungle-filled river gorges that have captivated Bali’s visitors for decades and are so much a part of the region’s legendary mystique.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] Shops, restaurants, and moneychangers are scattered along the busy stretch. [SEP] The beach itself is shallow and gently shelving, making it an ideal place for small children. [SEP] There is calm water on the inside of the reef and good snorkeling over it. [SEP] Lovina’s dark sand is less inviting than the white or golden variety at the southern resorts, and gets too hot to walk on in bare feet in the middle of the day.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1

From a study of their plants and animals, the 19th-century naturalist Alfred Wallace divided the Indonesian islands into a western group, regarded as part of southeast Asia, and an eastern group, which belonged geographically to Australia/Oceania. [SEP] He then drew the line between the two through the deep Lombok Strait separating Bali and Lombok. [SEP] The division is not quite so clear-cut now, but the basic principle of the “Wallace Line” is still accepted. [SEP] For many years, the island of Lombok was the domain of the Sasaks, a people who had	come	from the Asian mainland by way of Java and Bali. [SEP] They were animists who revered the spirits they believed to be in the living things and inanimate objects around them. [SEP] As Islam spread through the islands (apart from Bali) some people in Lombok adopted it in a version of their own, Wektu Telu, which retained many influences of animism. [SEP] Today, a majority of people are more or less orthodox Muslims: As you travel about Lombok, you will notice many exotic country mosques with their domes and arabesque arcades, as well as the growing numbers of young women who wear robes and headscarves. [SEP] The first succession of Balinese invasions started in the 16th century. [SEP] For a while, most of Lombok was governed from Karangasem in Bali.

[SEP] The resemblance is harder to see now that an extra pool and a rectangular swimming pool have been added. [SEP] To the north of Narmada at Lingsar, a new spring is said to have burst into life to greet the Balinese when they came to Lombok, and they chose the site for an ecumenical temple intended to bring together people of different religions. [SEP] The upper compound is reserved for the Hindus. [SEP] The pool in the Wektu Telu temple is the home of big plump eels, overfed on offerings of boiled eggs which are conveniently sold by vendors at the gate. [SEP] In another enclosure, the stones wound in white cloth with a yellow sash	come	from Gunung Rinjani, and Chinese Taoists have put mirrors there to repel the malevolent spirits.

[SEP] There’s losmen or bungalow accommodations and a growing number of new, very comfortable small hotels on all three islands, as well as small stores where you can buy basic food, bottled water, and cold drinks. [SEP] Warungs serve simple meals, mostly the standard Indonesian-style dishes and whatever fresh fish has	come	in.

Catalonia’s legendary founding father also gave the budding nation its flag of four horizontal red stripes on a gold field, the oldest still in use in Europe. [SEP] Legend holds that the stripes were etched in Wilfred’s blood, drawn on his shield as an escutcheon by the fingers of the Frankish king after the count had courageously defended his overlord in a battle. [SEP] When King Louis V refused to	come	to their aid against Moorish raiders, the counts of Barcelona declared their independence in 988, a date celebrated as Catalonia’s birth as a nation-state. [SEP] The Catalan nation was soon enlarged through marriage and military adventure. [SEP] Ramón Berenguer III (1096–1131) captured Mallorca, Ibiza, and Tarragona from the Moors and acquired the French county of Provence through his heiress wife. [SEP] His successor, Ramón Berenguer IV, united Catalonia with neighboring Aragón by marriage, and his son Alfonso II became the first joint-king of Aragón and Catalonia and was known as “the Emperor of the Pyrenees.” [SEP] His kingdom extended all the way to Nice. [SEP] But much of this territory was lost by the next king, Alfonso’s son Peter the Catholic, who picked the losing side in the Frenc	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Tibidabo The first bright, clear morning or late afternoon of your visit, head for Tibidabo, the 542-meter (1,778-foot) peak that overlooks Barcelona. [SEP] The views of the city are breathtaking. [SEP] You can clearly make out the Sagrada Familia and the grid plan of the Eixample. [SEP] Families	come	here on summer evenings to enjoy the 1950s-style amusement park, and weekends are crowded with joggers and cyclists. [SEP] You can also climb Torre de Collserola, by the English architect Sir Norman Foster, or visit the church of the Sagrat Corazón. [SEP] A neo-Gothic work by Enric Sagnier, the church is surmounted by a monumental figure of Christ, one of the city’s landmarks. [SEP] To reach the summit take the FCG train (not the metro) to “Avda. Tibidabo” from the Plaça de Catalunya. [SEP] From here a Tramvia Blau (blue tram) runs daily in the summer, Saturdays and Sundays the rest of the year, taking you up to the funicular station, past stately mansions. [SEP] In five minutes the funicular (closed mid-October through February) lifts you through pine woods to the top, where you have a spe	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Recreation and Sports Although most visitors to the capital do not	come	for outdoor pursuits or sports, Beijing does have a variety of recreational activities. [SEP] Most international hotels maintain full-service fitness centers with exercise machines, saunas, indoor swimming pools, and other facilities such as tennis courts, with day rates for non-guests. [SEP] The city parks are fine places for jogging, exercises, tai chi, walking, and other early morning workouts. [SEP] Golf, bowling, and billiards are the three most popular recreational sports. [SEP] Beijing also offers bungee jumping (at the Shidu Bungee Jumping Facility in the Fangshan District), paintball (at Color Me Purple in Wanfangting Park), rock climbing (at the Qidagudu Climbing Club in the Xuanwu District), horseback riding (check with the Movenpick Hotel), and shooting (at the China North Shoot	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhatToDo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Western Hills When China’s rulers really wanted to escape the heat of the city, they went farther west than the Summer Palace to the Western Hills (Xi Shan), romantically known today as Fragrant Hills Park (Xiangshan Gong yuan). [SEP] Imperial villas first dotted these hillsides — 27 km (17 miles) from Beijing — more than 800 years ago. [SEP] But it was the Qing Emperor Qianlong who converted the Western Hills into a formal mountain retreat for the enjoyment of the court, complete with its own temples, lakes, gardens, and even a zoo. [SEP] Late autumn is the favorite season for park visitors these days, when leaves turn a fiery red. [SEP] However, locals as well as tourists	come	to the Western Hills year round for the natural beauty and historic sites. [SEP] Two renowned temples still survive in the Western Hills. [SEP] Near the park’s north gate are the four great halls of the Temple of the Sleeping Buddha (Wo Fo Si). [SEP] In the final hall (Wo Fo Dian) there is a 5-m (16-ft) lacquered statue of the reclining Buddha (dated 1321) about to attain nirvana.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Reduced by war and the Wall to a bleak no-man’s-land, the square that was at one time the busiest in Europe has burst back into life in the most invigorating fashion. [SEP] What was once a scar on the landscape, epitomizing the division of the city and country, is now a thriving arts, entertainment, shopping and business center. [SEP] The impact of the towering, modern buildings, made almost predominantly from glass, is breathtaking. [SEP] Investment from corporations such as Daimler-Chrysler and Sony has resulted in the construction of shopping malls, a theater, casino, a splendid hotel, cinemas, and a film museum. [SEP] Almost 100,000 people a day	come	here to marvel at the striking architecture and explore the latest attractions in this ever-changing city. [SEP] The Sony Center is a vibrant entertainment complex, contained with a central courtyard under a glass ceiling. [SEP] Technophiles can check out the latest gadgets at Sony’s first European department store, while film buffs will be intrigued by the exhibits at the excellent new Film Museum Berlin. [SEP] A fascinating contrast to the futuristic architecture and technological content can be found in the elegant remains of the old Grandhotel Esplanade, now preserved behind glass walls. [SEP] The nearby Arkaden shopping center became a firm favorite with city shoppers as soon as it opened in 1998, and the cafés, casino, and theater in Marlene-Dietrich-Platz pay tribute to the city’s mo	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Sweeping eastwards from the gate, this grand 61-m (200-ft) -wide avenue, literally named “Beneath the Linden Trees,” was Berlin’s showcase boulevard. [SEP] Frederick the Great saw it as the center of his royal capital, and it became the most prestigious address in town. [SEP] Some of its splendor fell victim to 19th-century building speculation, but the avenue remained fashionable until the bombs of World War II reduced it to rubble. [SEP] Now the trees have been replanted and the most important buildings restored. [SEP] Its western end is dominated by the Russian Federation Embassy on the right as you	come	from Brandenburg Gate. [SEP] Close by is the smartest hotel in town; the supremely elegant Hotel Adlon was recently built on the site of the original hotel of the same name, which was a 1930s Berlin legend. [SEP] Continuing east, you pass the unprepossessing modern façade of the Komische Oper, one of Berlin’s most important opera companies. [SEP] The ugly exterior is the result of post-war reconstruction; happily, the magnificently over-the-top original gilded interior has been retained.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
restaurant on the fourth floor is the place to calm your shattered nerves. [SEP] The Deutscher Dom now houses a fascinating exhibition, Fragen an die deutsche Geschichte (German History Under Question), which was previously in the Reichstag. [SEP] This frank examination of Germany’s social and political history cleverly combines documents, photographs, and radio broadcasts to chronicle the rise of Fascism and the development of democracy. [SEP] The descriptive panels are all in German, but audio guides and information booklets are available in English and French. [SEP] A short stroll leads to Friedrichstraße, where over 100,000 m of GDR architectural monstrosity have been demolished and replaced by a very elegant development of designer shops, offices, and apartments. [SEP] French élan has	come	to Berlin in the form of a branch of the famous department store, Galeries Lafayette, at Quartier 207. [SEP] The sophisticated Art Deco styling of Quartier 206, home to some very exclusive designer boutiques, is the work of Americans Pen, Cobb, Freed, and Partners. [SEP] Walking along Friedrichstraße, you can only marvel at the changes that have been made here since reunification. [SEP] Nowhere is this brought home more strongly than at Checkpoint Charlie, that infamous border crossing between East and West. [SEP] Today, the barbed wire and barriers are gone, but the memories remain, housed in the fascinat-ing Haus am Checkpoint Charlie Museum.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
On the Grunewald’s west side, along Havelchaussee, the Grunewaldturm (Grunewald Tower) is a Neo-Gothic tower built in 1897 to commemorate the 100th birthday of King Wilhelm I. You can climb the 205 steps to reach the 55-m- (180-ft- ) high observation platform for views as far as Potsdam. [SEP] Ferry stations in the area offer boat rides on the River Havel and forest lakes, and the east bank of the Havel is lined with sandy beaches as far as the Wannsee lakes. [SEP] The waterfront near Wannsee S-Bahn station is a crowded spot where city-dwellers	come	and let their hair down on warm spring and summer days. [SEP] The water bustles with pleasure boats and ferries, and you can cruise all the way to Spandau and Potsdam from here. [SEP] Strandbad Wannsee is Berlin’s biggest beach, and the longest inland one in Europe. [SEP] West of the Großer Wannsee, Königstraße crosses Berliner Forst, an extension of the Grunewald to Glienicke Park. [SEP] Its whimsical landscaping of little hills, bridges, and ponds was the work of Peter Josef Lenné in the early 19th century. [SEP] Schloß Glienicke (1828) is a rather austere Neo-Classical edifice, but the nearby cloister, villa, and garden houses add a romantic touch.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
The capital of Bermuda since 1815, Hamilton is a very small and friendly city, despite its importance in the world of finance, banking, and insurance. [SEP] It is the heart of government and decision making, and because it is the only container port on the island, it is also the center of shipping and trade. [SEP] Local people gravitate here for shopping and entertainment, and visitors crowd the streets in summer when the cruise ships are in town. [SEP] Front Street runs along the water and is the first part of town seen by cruise passengers as ships	come	to shore. [SEP] It is the life and soul of Hamilton and a focus for many activities, especially during the summer months. [SEP] A long row of pastel-painted buildings offer the best in tax-free shopping: jewelry, liquor, clothing, and crystal. [SEP] Explore the narrow alleyways that lead off Front Street to discover small shops selling collectibles or locally designed arts and crafts, or small restaurants offering local seafood. [SEP] On Front Street itself there are a number of restaurants with verandas on the first floor, where you can have a drink or meal and watch the world go by. [SEP] At the west end of Front Street, on the waterfront, you will find the Visitor Service Bureau and the terminal for the local ferries that ply across Great and Little Sound from Hamilton to the southern an	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
was built around 1725 on land bought by John Trimingham II. [SEP] Originally, the family built ships and operated a wharf in front of the house, “at the foot of the Lane,” as the end of Hamilton Harbour was then known. [SEP] The bottom floor of the house was used to store goods and equipment, while the upper floor provided living quarters. [SEP] In 1961 the house was acquired by the Historic Monuments Trust, precursor to the Bermuda National Trust, but it was still occupied by elderly Trimingham family members until 1990. [SEP] Two rooms on the upper level are open to the public, where Trimingham furniture and family portraits can be seen. [SEP] Just as popular are the gardens, set against the water’s edge. [SEP] A 300-year-old tamarind tree sheds comforting shade over the house, and ducks	come	from the water to share your sandwiches. [SEP] If you turn up Berry Hill Road at the same roundabout, you will find the entrance to the Botanical Gardens and Camden (bus route [SEP]1). [SEP] Camden was designated as the official residence of Bermuda’s premier after self-government began in 1970. [SEP] It is an impressive colonial building with painted shutters and fretwork. [SEP] The Botanical Gardens that surround the house were inaugurated in 1898 and doubled in size to 15 hectares (36 acres) in 1921. [SEP] There are large glass houses with cacti and orchids along with formal gardens, lawns, and an aromatic garden designed for the enjoyment of blind visitors. [SEP] There are also tables under the trees in the rolling landscape in front of Camden for picnics.

The South Road You will	come	first to the Elbow Beach Resort and the nearby public Bermuda Beach. [SEP] The resort is one of the premier hotels on the island and sits on a long stretch of sand that is for hotel guests exclusively. [SEP] South Road travels on top of the cliffs and offers beautiful views of the sand dunes and beaches below. [SEP] Don’t worry about trying to take in these views while driving, for there are many stopping places along the way where you can take photographs or simply enjoy the panorama. [SEP] The way to each beach is marked with a wooden sign, which leads to parking areas for bicycles and cars off the main road. [SEP] Once you reach Warwick Long Bay there are a series of public beaches that allow you to walk along the sand or find a patch to call your own for the day.

erman engineers at the time. [SEP] The gunning placements held “disappearing” guns, which could not be seen from land or sea. [SEP] Other gunning placements were also added by US engineers during World War II. [SEP] A sturdy caponier (a small fortified room with openings for rifles) was to act as a last defense if the battlements were overrun. [SEP] It was never needed, as the fort never saw any action, and today the ramparts offer panoramic views of Great Sound. [SEP] There are 9 hectares (22 acres) of grassland all around the fort where you can enjoy a picnic. [SEP] Just beyond the fort, watch out for a narrow lane to the right with a sign for the Heydon Trust Chapel. [SEP] This simple place of worship, on land set aside for personal reflection, is open at all hours for those who want to	come	and pray. [SEP] (The building is listed on maps of 1616 as a personal residence.) [SEP] Visitors can admire the architecture and see the old water storage tank that collects water for use inside. [SEP] The village of Somerset lies only half a mile beyond the fort. [SEP] It is a small settlement but has many shops that are branches of larger Hamilton stores and also a couple of well-regarded restaurants for a leisurely lunch.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Taking Cavendish Road out of Hamilton leads to Middle Road, which runs through the widest section of land in Bermuda. [SEP] Although they are never more than a mile from the sea, the people who live here are considered country dwellers by those who live on the coast. [SEP] You will	come	first to the Arboretum (bus route [SEP]3), 9 hectares (22 acres) of lawns and woods filled with native trees. [SEP] Separate swathes of land concentrate on collections of ficus and palms, with an area of general woodland beyond. [SEP] It’s a great place for children to run wild or explore in the undergrowth. [SEP] Less than a mile past the Arboretum, you will find two churches on the right side of the road, backed by hundreds of white painted family tombs on the hillside. [SEP] The larger building first catches the eye, but it is the smaller whitewashed Old Devonshire Church that holds the interest. [SEP] The church originally erected here in 1716 was totally destroyed by a mysterious explosion on Easter Sunday, 31 March 1970.

Around the corner in Featherbed Alley, you will find Featherbed Alley Printery, a small museum with a working model of the Gutenberg printing press first brought from England by Joseph Stockdale in 1783 and used to produce the Bermuda Gazette — first issued on 17 January 1784. [SEP] The building where the paper was originally printed is the Stockdale House, on the corner of Printer’s Alley and Needle and Thread Alley. [SEP] Stockdale was an extremely industrious man and also a man of foresight, as he also organized and ran the first postal service on the island. [SEP] Continue along Duke of Kent Street and you will	come	to the Unfinished Church, an elegant edifice originally begun in the 1870s when St. Peter’s Church was badly damaged by a storm and thought to be beyond repair. [SEP] As construction proceeded, however, the local population decided that they would rather invest their money in repairing the old church and work on the unfinished church was immediately stopped. [SEP] Had the church been completed, it would have been a fitting place of worship. [SEP] Continue to the right of the Unfinished Church, up Government Hill Road and through the rolling fairways of St. George’s Golf Course, one of the most challenging on the island, until you reach the coast.

Faneuil Hall Marketplace Annually 14 million visitors	come	to Faneuil Hall, the great “Cradle of Liberty” and marketplace. [SEP] It’s very commercial, but very alluring and one of the most successful restorations anywhere. [SEP] Huguenot merchant Peter Faneuil (pronounced fannel, fan’l or funnel), gave it to the city in 1742. [SEP] The original, consisting of a town hall above and a market below was burned down in 1762, but was swiftly rebuilt. [SEP] Here on the second floor Boston’s great orators raised their voices against British tyranny, against slavery, and female oppression. [SEP] It’s still used for meetings and assemblies. [SEP] The vast painting behind the stage shows Daniel Webster and John Calhoun arguing over the Union.

[SEP] On the third floor the Museum of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, the oldest militia in the nation founded in 1637, displays historic flags, paintings, and military memorabilia (open Monday–Friday, 9am–5pm). [SEP] The building’s most legendary feature is the grasshopper weathervane. [SEP] No one knows really why tinsmith Shem Drowne chose the grasshopper motif, although some say it symbolizes good fortune. [SEP] In 1805 Charles Bulfinch enlarged the hall. [SEP] Across the plaza from Fanueil Hall the three Quincy market buildings fill with crowds of locals and visitors, who	come	to feast on chowder, seafood, deli sandwiches, pizza, and an array of ethnic cuisines.

The Chic and the Victorian A stroll along Newbury Street — the city’s most expensive real estate — is the most civilized and congenial of Boston experiences. [SEP] This is where the chic and the conservative	come	to furnish their homes with art and antiques, wrap their bodies in designer fashion, have their hair styled in upmarket salons, and wine, dine, and drink iced coffee al fresco in summer. [SEP] Image and appearance take center stage here, both in the showcase windows and the personas of the people looking at them. [SEP] Every display — whether of fine art, ice cream, or fashion — is worth a picture. [SEP] Some of the galleries exhibit works by major artists. [SEP] Notice the architecture as well: At the end of the converted carriage houses, the less genteel eastern end gives way to series of alternate classic bow- and flat-fronted townhouses.

recious, devoid of cornices and fancy wrought iron. [SEP] When the marsh of Back Bay was filled in during the 1860s, water flooded into this area, forcing the streets and houses to be raised on pilings. [SEP] Take Tremont Street south and cross over the Massachusetts Turnpike into the South End. [SEP] Come if only to savor one (or more) of its great restaurants, a clutch of chic bistros on Tremont Street around Clarendon. [SEP] Like so much of Boston, the South End began as a landfill project, but it soon lost out in desirability to Back Bay. [SEP] A multi-ethnic mix of Hispanic, Irish, West Indian, and Greek, the community is also home to Boston’s largest gay community. [SEP] Some districts — to the south of Shawmut Avenue, for example — are best avoided. [SEP] In others, though, you will	come	across bright community murals and perhaps a reggae band playing in a local park. [SEP] The neighborhood boasts (justifiably) a fine concentration of Victorian terraced residences. [SEP] Bow brick houses, their steep stoops (or steps) framed with scrolled black railings, are set off by parks, the finest examples being Union Park Square, situated just off Tremont Street, and Rutland and Concord squares both farther to the south.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
There’s an even better view from the top of the 253-ft (77-m) Pilgrim Monument in Provincetown. [SEP] It’s called the Pilgrim monument because this is where the Pilgrims actually landed first before moving on to Plymouth. [SEP] The museum at the base of the tower tells the story. [SEP] P-Town, is a fabled place. [SEP] Although the main street is crowded and lined with commercial tourist trinket stores, it still has a magical atmosphere, because it has an “anything goes” attitude. [SEP] It is the East Coast’s gay mecca (along with the Hamptons, and Cherry Grove and the Pines on Fire Island). [SEP] Same-sex couples walk the streets hand in hand, and outrageous transvestites entertain in the cabarets. [SEP] Families	come	to browse the stores selling T-shirts, and scrimshaw and driftwood curios, and to enjoy the beaches and the fishing and whale-watch trips. [SEP] In the early 20th century Provincetown was a major art colony and there are still numerous art galleries, particularly at the east end of town. [SEP] In summer, the town is swamped and every guesthouse filled. [SEP] In winter, it’s quiet. [SEP] Many of the commercial stores close and only the residents remain — a community of artists, Portuguese fishermen, and a handful of restaurateurs. [SEP] You can visit Provincetown for a day (see page 110), but if you don’t stay longer, you’ll miss half the fun.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] Next door, number 18 was built as a merchant’s house in the ﬁrst half of the 15th century. [SEP] Used as the Arany Sas (Golden Eagle) pharmacy from 1750 until 1913, it is now the most attractive of this area’s small museums. [SEP] Beautiful old majolica vessels are the stars of an atmospheric re-creation of the pharmacy, and there are also informative displays on potions, practices, and alchemy in the Budapest of this era. [SEP] The ﬁnal street of this district to be explored is the leafy Tóth Arpád sétány. [SEP] This promenade, situated along the western ramparts, offers views of the Buda Hills and the huge Southern Railway Station (Déli pályaudavar) rather than a glorious Danube panorama. [SEP] Nonetheless, this is a delightful stroll, particularly in early evening, when the locals	come	out to enjoy the fresh air. [SEP] At the northern end, various cannon signal the entrance to the Museum of Military History (Hadtörténeti Múzeum).

Margaret Island (Margit-sziget) The elite of the Roman empire escaped everyday cares on this leafy oasis between the two banks, and in later eras princes and plutocrats did likewise. [SEP] Today wealthy tourists enjoy the thermal facilities and treatments offered at the two international-class hotels on the island. [SEP] The leisure establishment of most interest to visitors is the huge outdoor Palatinus Baths (Palatinus strand) which includes thermal pools and boasts a capacity of 20,000 swimmers and sunbathers. [SEP] The island is not just for tourists, however: Budapestis of all ages	come	here to walk, run, swim, play tennis or team games, or simply sunbathe. [SEP] It’s also a famous spot for courting couples. [SEP] The island is 2 km (11⁄2 miles) long and only a few hundred yards at the widest part. [SEP] Many of its estimated population of 10,000 trees are now more than a century old, and large areas of the island are lawned and landscaped. [SEP] Best of all, cars (with a few exceptions) are prohibited, thus preserving the island’s peace and quiet.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Váci utca runs into the ever-busy, yet somehow relaxed, Vörösmarty tér. [SEP] This is one of Pest’s favourite gathering places, often lined with craft stalls and resounding to a brass band. [SEP] After a browse through Luxus department store, it’s probably time for coffee and cakes at Gerbeaud, doyen of Budapest’s coffee-house scene since 1884. [SEP] If the sumptuous high-ceilinged interior is a little too formal for your liking, then take a terrace seat and watch the world go by. [SEP] Stroll a few yards towards the river and you will	come	to yet another pleasant and lively square, Vigadó tér, which has the advantage of a riverside location with Castle Hill views. [SEP] Here, too, you will find craft stalls and any number of buskers. [SEP] A vibrant café-restaurant comprises one side of the square, but the dominant building is the splendid Vigadó theatre. [SEP] The interior hall is an acoustically perfect auditorium renovated in 1980 (its predecessors having twice perished in war and revolution), but the façade has been gloriously restored in mid-19th-century Hungarian-Eastern style. [SEP] The list of performers and conductors who have graced the Vigadó theatre is an impressive Who’s Who of the past 150 years of European classical music: Liszt, Brahms, Wagner, Mahler, Bartók, Prokoﬁev, Casals, Björling, and von Karajan.

of the Ethnographical Museum. [SEP] Catch the number 8 bus departing from the terminal next to the HEV station, and ask for the “Skanzen.” [SEP] There are also regular buses from the Tourinform ofﬁce, on the road from the bus station to the centre. [SEP] The 46-hectare (115-acre) museum site will eventually contain ten “villages” of real houses, churches, mills, farm buildings, workshops, and smithys, dating mostly from the late 18th to the early 20th century, and culled from all over Hungary. [SEP] At present there are only three settlements to view, but even these will occupy you for at least half a day and possibly longer. [SEP] It is a fascinating and picturesque simulation of old rural Hungary, brought to life by active craftspeople, gingerbread makers, and other “rural folk.” (Try to	come	on the ﬁrst or third Sunday of the month, when there are several different craft demonstrations.) An excellent guide book giving the general history of the villages and buildings, and details about individual interiors, is available for purchase.

The North Shore Driving from Budapest and navigating the lake in an counter-clockwise direction (along the perimeter Highway 71), the ﬁrst settlement of any size is at Balatonalmádi. [SEP] There is a medieval chapel in the parish church, but most people	come	here to enjoy the beach — the biggest and one of the best-equipped along the northern shore, with space for 12,000 sunbathing bodies.

The American Pioneers The first Americans to	come	to California from the eastern states were Boston fur traders taking the Cape Horn route at the end of the 18th century. [SEP] They didn’t stay for long, but gradually other traders and fur trappers began to arrive overland through Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, settling only in small numbers until the famous covered wagons began their heroic treks of the 1840s. [SEP] The hardships the pioneers suffered in the Sierra Nevada mountains, Death Valley, and the Mojave Desert became the stuff of California legend, the most tragic being the fate of 87 pioneers who set out from Illinois in 1846. [SEP] While attempting to cross the Sierra Nevada, George Donner’s wagon train became snowed in, and from November until February was stuck high in the mountains north of Lake Tahoe, at a point now 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
The reform movement, intent on breaking the political power of the big corporations, attacked corrupt practices in administration, public finances, and banking, but did nothing to oppose the businessmen’s traditional resistance to unions and more liberal labor laws. [SEP] There was also a campaign of official discrimination against Chinese and Japanese immigrants, excluding them from owning land and preventing further immigration. [SEP] All kinds of produce grew large and lush in California’s fertile, irrigated soil, but the most financially profitable thing to	come	out of the Californian earth was oil. [SEP] Drilling had begun in the 1860s but didn’t take off until 1892. [SEP] By the 1920s, the derricks of the Standard, Union, and Shell oil companies had sprouted all over the Los Angeles basin. [SEP] In that one decade, the state’s oil revenues were $2.5 billion, $500 million more than all the gold the Sierras yielded in a century. [SEP] Sunny, oil-rich Los Angeles was therefore the perfect place for the car to emerge as an everyday household accessory. [SEP] From 1920 to 1930 L.A.’s population more than doubled, and the number of private cars increased fivefold.

[SEP] In the middle-class neighborhoods of Los Angeles county it seems that every other house has its own swimming pool — from the air you see the mass of turquoise blobs as you fly into the airport. [SEP] Surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, sailing, fishing, waterskiing, and windsurfing can all be enjoyed at various points on the coast.

Thunder Bay For vacationers, this town strategically located on Lake Superior’s northwest shore is a springboard to the national parks of Ontario’s interior. [SEP] But it’s also worth taking a look first at the impressive port facilities of this western terminus of the St. Lawrence–Great Lakes Seaway, which has given Thunder Bay its second name: the Lakehead.

Upper Canada Village Here, 86 km (53 miles) southeast of Ottawa, the two strands of the region’s history	come	together in the meticulous recreation of a 19th-century pioneering village, perhaps the best of the country’s many historical showpieces.

[SEP] Iroquois clothes and artifacts give a hint of life outside the stockade. [SEP] The rue Bonsecours is one of the principal historic residential streets leading from rue Notre-Dame towards the Vieux Port (Old Port). [SEP] The Maison Papineau (Number 440), distinguished by its double row of gabled garrets in the roof, dates back to 1785. [SEP] It is the family home of the controversial 19th-century politician Louis-Joseph Papineau, leader of the militant patriotes but also cautious protector of his seigneurial property (see page 19). [SEP] In 1837, the house nearly burned down in a violent riot, and British soldiers had to	come	to Papineau’s rescue. [SEP] He fled to the countryside and did not take part in the subsequent insurrection. [SEP] On the corner of rue St-Paul, the older Maison du Calvet was built in 1725 by a prominent Huguenot merchant. [SEP] As a Protestant, Pierre du Calvet was appointed by the British justice of the peace but then ended up in jail himself for selling supplies and information to the American invaders. [SEP] With its broad chimney, fine-grained limestone frames around the doors, and gracefully tapered casement windows, the house is one of the more handsome architectural specimens of the French colonial era.

Founded in the early 19th century by a Scottish fur trader, James McGill, and especially respected for its engineering and medicine faculties, it has a student enrollment of 15,000. [SEP] In 1969, Québécois separatists staged violent but unsuccessful demonstrations to have it transformed into a French-speaking institution. [SEP] (The city’s other English-speaking college is Concordia while the Université de Montréal and the Université du Québec à Montréal are both French-speaking). [SEP] Between Maisonneuve and R. Lévesque boulevards, art and commerce	come	together at the Place des Arts and Complexe Desjardins.

Turn north at Hope to Yale, an old fort of the Hudson’s Bay Company, terminus of its stern-wheelers unable to negotiate the rapids upriver — at low water you can still see their ring tie-ups on the river bank.

The strands of B.C.’s destiny	come	together where the Fraser Canyon narrows at the torrential rapids of Hell’s Gate. [SEP] For thousands of years, this point in the river’s descent to the ocean was the local native peoples’ favored fishing spot for the salmon swimming to their spawning grounds. [SEP] It was here in 1808 that they helped Nor’Wester fur trader Simon Fraser with his canoe past the rapids, over a swaying ropeway of vines strung along the canyon wall, enabling him to follow to the ocean the river that bears his name. [SEP] In 1914, the C.N.R. blocked the salmon’s passage with rock-blasts through the canyon for the railway. [SEP] The consequent 90 percent reduction of the annual sockeye salmon catch was remedied only 30 years later when multimillion-dollar steel-and-concrete channels were built for the fish.

The Bug Bubble burst with the rise of chemical dyes in the 1870s. [SEP] With the failure of yet another mono-culture, the Spanish government felt constrained to help the Canarian economy. [SEP] In the mid-19th century, free port status was granted by royal decree to one port in each of the islands (two in Tenerife). [SEP] The lowering of duties and trade barriers at a time of considerable shipping expansion had the desired effect, and Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas soon became two of the world’s busiest ports. [SEP] The most recent major crop to	come	from the Canaries is bananas. [SEP] The variety is the dwarf banana, small and very tasty, and today demand actually outstrips production in some areas. [SEP] The first exports were made in the 1880s and the banana has continued to be a mainstay of the islands’ economy. [SEP] Despite some recent problems and concern for the future, it is hoped that bananas will continue to be an important Canarian crop alongside their other staples; tomatoes and potatoes. [SEP] In 1912, Cabildos (Island Councils) were created and given the responsibility for the social, political and economic administration of each island, and co-ordination with the Town Halls. [SEP] This led, in 1927, to the islands being divided into two provinces; Santa Cruz de Tenerife with the islands of Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera a	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
The Spanish Civil War The plot that sparked off the Spanish Civil War was hatched in the Canary Islands.

[SEP] They had	come	to meet a fellow officer, Francisco Franco, whom the government had banished to the Canaries for subversive plotting. [SEP] From the Canaries, Franco took off for North Africa, the launching pad for the insurgent right-wing attack. [SEP] Three years later his armies had triumphed in a ruthless struggle that cost hundreds of thousands of Spanish lives. [SEP] The Canaries were not spared the horrors of the war (mass Republican executions took place in the aptly named Barranco del Infierno, the Gorge of Hell, on Tenerife), but on the whole the islands prospered during Franco’s period of dictatorship, which provided for added protection to their free-port status.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5

lf of the 19th century. [SEP] Just across the road you can stop to pay a visit to the edge of the volcanic crater of Volcán de San Antonio and the mirador beyond it, (open daily 8am–6pm). [SEP] In an exposed, windy location this looks, considering the damage it did, exceedingly benign. [SEP] Just south of here are even more recent signs of volcanic activity; the volcano of Teneguía that erupted in 1971, fortunately without casualties. [SEP] These eruptions sent an ever-widening stream of molten lava rushing down the green hillside here and you can see it now, petrified and black, as the road runs right through the once deadly mass. [SEP] Surprisingly, plátanos (bananas) seem to take a liking to this environment, and can be seen thriving all around you. [SEP] Once down to sea level you will	come	across the Playa de Zamora a small beach of jet-black sand squeezed in between the surrealistic lava fields. [SEP] A short distance away, next to the twin lighthouses — one old and one new — is a tiny fishermen’s cove with a stony beach that has a tiny restaurant, well, a shack really, that serves up the most delicious fresh fried fish (see page 139). [SEP] After that there is nothing of note, except of course the lava fields and views, until you rejoin the main road at Fuencaliente.

[SEP] A scenic spiraling road leads to the top, where the Real Club de Golf enjoys such a picturesque location that even non-golfers are tempted to pick up a club. [SEP] The views from here take in the mountains, fertile valley and vast stretches of the coastline from Las Palmas to the distant south.

[SEP] Its size — over 70 rooms — has caused archaeologists to postulate that it may have been a military academy, which expanded regularly throughout its history. [SEP] The western building has the most richly carved façade. [SEP] There are also numerous depictions of Mayan homes or nah, which have changed little since classical times and can still be found all across the countryside of Yucatán. [SEP] The eastern building has a statue of a dwarf dressed in a turtle shell placed in a position normally associated with the rulers of Mayan cities. [SEP] A serpent is entwined all along the upper façade around the statue. [SEP] From its upper levels the many buildings at the site	come	clearly into view.

[SEP] In 1889 the masterpiece was struck by lightning and burned almost to the ground. [SEP] Fortunately, the ruin was quickly restored to its original, resplendent state. [SEP] The emperor was carried here in a procession in the first lunar month of each year to pray for a bountiful harvest. [SEP] The floor plan of the hall provides the key to the building’s function. [SEP] The four central columns represent the seasons; then	come	two concentric rings of 12 columns each, representing the months and the dozen two-hour periods into which the day was divided; and 28 hardwood pillars symbolize the constellations. [SEP] Although tourists can no longer enter this monument, its colorful interiors can still be glimpsed from outside. [SEP] Other attractions at the park include the Round Altar (Haunqiutan) and Echo Wall, where whispered secrets ricochet and are mysteriously magnified, crossing an immense courtyard, without benefit of modern technology.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
The first elements of the wall system were built more than 2,000 years ago, but the expansion and consolidation of the project near Beijing began under the Ming Dynasty in the 14th century. [SEP] The serpentine stone bulwark and elevated highway became Wanlichangcheng — “The Wall Ten Thousand Li Long” (about 6,000 km/3,700 miles). [SEP] The restored section of the wall at Badaling, undulating up the unexpectedly steep hillsides, can be a test of a tourist’s endurance. [SEP] It is far steeper and more formidable than it looks in any tourist brochure. [SEP] Out of breath, many visitors exchange sympathetic smiles along the way as they ascend to one or another of the towers. [SEP] If you walk far enough west, you	come	upon unrestored sections of the wall at the edge of the Gobi Desert. [SEP] The Badaling section is often overcrowded these days. [SEP] Two other sections now provide relatively easy access to tourists: the Great Wall at Mutianyu, as beautiful as the section at Badaling but a little less steep, and the Great Wall at Simatai, more distant from Beijing than other sections but virtually unrestored. [SEP] Simatai is the least crowded and most original of the Great Wall sites. [SEP] Although it too has a cable-car concession, Simatai bills itself as “the most dangerous section of the Great Wall.”	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
, and passenger ships. [SEP] On the far side of the river, fragrant forests climb the slopes of Yuelu Hill, a favorite escape from the subtropical heat of the city in summer. [SEP] One of the evergreen trees in the mountainside Lushan Temple is more than 1,700 years old. [SEP] The Qing Dynasty pavilion on top (Yunlugong) affords a fine panorama. [SEP] For most tourists the prime attraction of the region is found in the northeast part of town: the Hunan Provincial Museum, with its renowned relics of the Han Dynasty, including silks, ceramics, and lacquerware of unbelievable sophistication, as well as alluring figurines and musical instruments. [SEP] All these artifacts survived because they were buried in coffins within coffins in subterranean royal tombs. [SEP] These beautiful wooden boxes	come	from the royal graves at Mawangdui, as does the museum’s show-stopper: the remarkably well-preserved silk-wrapped mummy of the Marquis of Dai’s wife, Tohou, who died at age 50 in 186 b.c. Nearly 2,200 years later, her hair is still on her head and her expression is unchanged from the moment of her last breath. [SEP] Tourists in Changsha are sometimes taken to visit the local embroidery factory, where Hunan’s handicraft tradition has flourished for 2,000 years. [SEP] Staff artists paint original designs, usually of landscapes, animals, birds, or flowers, which the artisans reproduce stitch by microscopic stitch in colorful silk. [SEP] The workers here are proudest of the double-faced embroidery, with a different picture on each side.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1

Mogao Caves In spite of the difficulties, tourists still head for this 2,000-year-old town to see China’s most magnificent ancient murals and painted statues. [SEP] Since you’ve	come	this far, they’re worth another 25 km (15 miles). [SEP] The Mogao Caves, hewn from a desert cliffside, tell the story of the great flowering of Buddhist art in China. [SEP] Begun in the fourth century, they were created in fits and starts over the next thousand years. [SEP] Statistics aren’t everything, but consider that there are 45,000 sq m (484,000 sq ft) of mural paintings. [SEP] They cover the walls and ceilings with brightly colored pictures of men and gods and speculations about eternity. [SEP] And in the same caves stand more than 2,000 painted sculptures, realistic or fantastic. [SEP] Of the several hundred grottoes still intact, only a few dozen are open to the public. [SEP] And even these are kept locked so that visits can be supervised. [SEP] The outer walls of the caves have be	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
The capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot is a sprawling, booming city with a metropolitan population of more than one million. [SEP] The center of town looks to the future with new official buildings, housing blocks, and wide avenues, but the traffic evokes nostalgia with its parade of donkey carts, ox carts, pony carts, and farm tractors, plus the usual proliferation of bicycles. [SEP] It might	come	as a surprise that Mongolians are only a small minority here. [SEP] Most of the residents of Hohhot are Han (ethnic Chinese), and Inner Mongolia’s close connection with China dates back several centuries. [SEP] For tourists in search of the exotic, though, Hohhot and vicinity offer many opportunities to make contact with Mongolian traditions. [SEP] You can drink butter tea with millet and sleep in a yurt, a felt-covered circular tent. [SEP] A quite unexpected feature of Hohhot is its modern racecourse. [SEP] Under the sky-blue domes of the reviewing stand, visitors are often treated to a Mongolian “rodeo” of racing and trick riding and perhaps a procession of two-humped camels. [SEP] Another lively spot is Xinhua Square, where half the town seems to exercise and play before work, returning 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
of Chinese classics. [SEP] You will find one pinnacle in the image of an “Elephant on a Stone Terrace” and another like a “Rhinoceros Looking at the Moon.” [SEP] At one point in the maze you must squeeze through the Narrowest Pass; doing so, according to Sani legend, adds ten years to your life. [SEP] From Peak Viewing Pavilion, the highest point in the Stone Forest, there’s a comprehensive view of this great thicket of jagged rocks thrusting skyward. [SEP] The biggest open space in the Stone Forest, a lawn surrounded by cherry trees, is the site of a Sani festival each June. [SEP] For 48 continuous hours, the tribesmen devote themselves to singing and dancing, wrestling matches, bullfights (actually, water buffalo fighting each other), feasting, and romancing. [SEP] Many of the celebrants	come	from Five Tree Village (Wukeshu), across Shilin Lake from the hotel. [SEP] This community of several thousand Sani residents shelters water buffalo, pigs, goats, and dogs. [SEP] The Sani themselves live in thatched-roof, mud-and-wattle houses. [SEP] Those who stay the night in the Stone Forest are usually entertained with a Sani folklore show. [SEP] Among the instruments in the orchestra are flutes, zithers, and a giant banjo with a hollow bottom. [SEP] Women dancers wear red, white, and black conical hats, while the men sport floppy black turbans. [SEP] Through song and mime they recount the legends that link their people to the otherworldly presence of the Stone Forest.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Around Nanjing Chinese pilgrims of all political persuasions	come	from many countries to honor the founder of the Chinese Republic at the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshanling), in the Purple Hills east of Nanjing. [SEP] The hillside complex roofed with blue tiles, completed in 1929, could scarcely be more grandiose. [SEP] Following a long winding avenue planted with plane trees, you continue up the 392 granite steps of the ceremonial staircase to the actual memorial hall. [SEP] There are statues of Dr. Sun standing, sitting (by a French sculptor, Paul Landowski), and recumbent above the vault itself. [SEP] On the ceiling is a mosaic version of the Nationalist (Guomindang) flag, a white star on a blue background. [SEP] Dr. Sun often roamed these hills during his Nanjing years.

Guitars, the rhythm of castanets and drumming heels, and taut, anguished songs — that’s flamenco. [SEP] You’ll be left breathless by these songs and dances from Andalusia. [SEP] There are two distinct forms of flamenco: the cante jondo (deep song) is an outpouring of intense, soul-searching emotions. [SEP] The agonized songs, heavy with the wail of Arabia,	come	from deep within the singer, while the dances are formal and sombre. [SEP] Cante jondo is seldom heard outside Andalusia and Madrid, except on recordings. [SEP] Not so the cante chico (light song), a more animated version performed in tablaos (floor shows) on the Costa Blanca. [SEP] With a little luck, you may even see flamenco performed by a top Spanish dance company touring on behalf of the Ministry of Information and Tourism’s Festivales de España. [SEP] Although the songs may express something of the cante jondo’s desolation, the dancing is very different. [SEP] The fandango, tango, farruca, and zambra are performed to the staccato rhythm of palmadas (hand-clapping), pitos (finger-snapping), the zapateado of fiercely drumming heels, and the fiery compulsion of the castanets.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Eating Out Far more interesting than the so-called international cuisine, the hearty local dishes are worth seeking out: ingredients	come	fresh from the sea or the farm and are served with a wide choice of the region’s excellent vegetables.

Tour operators offer any number of excursions, some more esoteric than others, with brochures and booking facilities available through your hotel or a local travel agent. [SEP] Another form of organized entertainment, amusement parks, are discussed below in the section for families with young children. [SEP] Bullfights: Andalucía is famed for its bullfighting traditions, and has two, Sevilla and Córdoba, of the seven first-class Plaza de Toros (bullrings) in Spain. [SEP] The provincial capitals of Almería, Granada, Huelva, Jaén, and Málaga as well as Algeciras and El Puerto de Santa María are second-class rings. [SEP] All others, including those of the resort towns along the Costa del Sol,	come	into the third class category. [SEP] The two main events are a Corrida de Toros, where fully qualified matadors fight fully-grown — at least 4 year old — toros (bulls), and Novilladas, where novilleros (novice matadors) fight novillos (immature bulls). [SEP] As a rule of thumb, the better events are held in the better plazas, particularly during the ferías (holiday fairs) held in the major cities. [SEP] Equally true is the fact that most of the events held in the resort towns are mainly for the benefit of tourists, and are of lesser quality. [SEP] They are not generally less expensive, though; small rings mean fewer seats, which often equates to higher prices. [SEP] Contrary to popular opinion, bullfights are not held every Sunday in each city.

But Marbella has its historic side, too. [SEP] In fact, its history dates back some 1,600 years, even though most of what can be seen, in the town at least, dates from the time of the Catholic Monarchs and later. [SEP] North of the main road, the Casco Antiguo (Old Town) provides an intriguing glimpse of the past that has been cleverly integrated to cater to modern visitors. [SEP] First, sit at a café table in the Plaza de los Naranjos (Square of the Orange Trees), where you can admire the noble 16th-century façade of the Casa Consistorial (Town Hall) and soak up the atmosphere. [SEP] Then wander through the maze of narrow, twisting streets where the whitewashed walls are decorated with colorful baskets of flowers. [SEP] As you explore the neighborhood, you’ll	come	across the historic parish church with its landmark bell tower, and the convents of La Trinidad and San Francisco (it is said that Miguel de Cervantes, creator of the famous Don Quixote, lodged at the latter). [SEP] Uphill from the church lie the crumbling walls of the Moorish castillo. [SEP] Scattered throughout this area also are an eclectic array of shops and galleries. [SEP] Other places of interest in Marbella are the Bonsai Museum, the only one in Spain and one of the best in the world, and the Museum of Spanish Contemporary Engravings. [SEP] Housed in a structure important in its own right, the latter is the first of its kind in Spain and has works by Picasso, Miró, Tapies, and other such famous artists.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
onsidered the best preserved Moorish baths in Europe. [SEP] The museum has interesting exhibits on Gibraltar’s history. [SEP] Of interest, too, is Nelson’s Anchorage, where Admiral Nelson’s body is said to have been brought in a barrel of rum after the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, and the nearby 100-ton Victorian super-gun, the largest gun of its type in the world. [SEP] Main Street ends at the Referendum Gates. [SEP] Beyond lies the cable-car station, where you can take a trip to the top of the Rock with a stop halfway to visit the Apes’ Den. [SEP] The tail-less Barbary apes that inhabit the Rock are natives of North Africa, descended from monkeys brought over by sailors as pets and ships’ mascots. [SEP] Legend has it that if the apes ever leave the Rock, then British rule will	come	to an end. [SEP] When the apes’ population declined significantly during World War II, Winston Churchill himself was worried, and the monkeys have been on special rations ever since. [SEP] The views from the summit 426 m (396 ft) up are spectacular, particularly across the strait to Morocco, along the coast toward Estepona, and down the sheer east face of the Rock to the water holding areas (for desalination) and the beaches of Sandy Bay, Catalan Bay, and Eastern Beach. [SEP] Whether you’re traveling in your own car or in an official taxi or minivan, don’t leave Gibraltar without taking a tour of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve area. [SEP] On the way up note the yellow patches and their accompanying metal rings; these were used when manually hauling the heavy cannons up the Rock.

Along the road from Almuñécar, pretty villas with spectacular coastal views dot the hillsides until, all of a sudden, the scenery changes dramatically.

[SEP] A Moorish castle, beautifully restored, stands isolated at the heart of the village. [SEP] Salobreña stands as the gateway to the agriculturally rich vega (plain) of the thriving port city of Motril. [SEP] Sugarcane, the source of the greenery, flourishes here. [SEP] The sugar refineries in the area have earned the town its nickname — Little Cuba. [SEP] Like that country, Motril is known for its rum, although its residents are crafty enough to make just about enough for local consumption, and no more.

Pottery and Ceramics It’s not surprising, given the importance of ceramics and pottery throughout Crete’s history, that it is still a significant industry. [SEP] Pieces	come	as small as a ring holder or olive bowl to huge garden pieces that would have to be shipped back home. [SEP] Both unglazed and ceramic styles are available; most notable of these is the bright blue glaze of Chaniá ceramics. [SEP] Traditional designs abound, including marine themes, Minoan designs, and Classical Greek imagery. [SEP] Modern free-form pieces can also be found, particularly in Chaniá where there are galleries stocked by avant-garde potters.

Inland from Ágios Nikólaos are three attractions that make an enjoyable morning or afternoon sightseeing. [SEP] Head out towards the village of Kritsá 12 km (7 miles) from town. [SEP] Before you reach the village itself you’ll find a beautiful Byzantine chapel on your right. [SEP] Panagía Kerá was built in the 13th century and decorated with superb frescoes of the 14th and 15th centuries. [SEP] You’ll need time to take in every detail of the interior and the simple lines of the exterior. [SEP] Resume your journey toward Kritsá, but don’t visit the village yet. [SEP] Follow signs to Lató, the remains of a Dorian city (7th–3rd centuries b.c.) scattered around two scrub-covered hilltops to the north. [SEP] The blocks of strong stone don’t	come	close to rivaling the fine fresco-covered walls of Minoan settlements, yet there is a satisfaction in both location and form when you climb among the remains of Lató. [SEP] There are also wonderful views down to the coast from here. [SEP] Finally you can allow yourself to head into Kritsá, perhaps to take some well-earned refreshment. [SEP] This ‘traditional’ village is perhaps overly touristy for some but it is still very much lived-in and extremely well-kept, with brilliant whitewashed walls accented by brightly painted windowframes and charming potted plants. [SEP] You’ll find good tavernas around the old village square — look for the huge plane tree.

és were where Ottomans used to socialize over dark thick coffee and communal narghiles (bubble pipes). [SEP] Today you can spend time over a drink or excellent fish dinner. [SEP] The maze of narrow streets behind the old harbor forms the core of the old town. [SEP] Most are pedestrian-only, inviting you to take an exploratory stroll. [SEP] At every turn there is something to see; most obvious will be the wealth of shopping opportunities at eye level. [SEP] Craft and jewelry stores create tempting displays, and cotton clothing is swathed across every wall. [SEP] But don’t neglect to look behind the wares to see Venetian stone lintels above, or to catch site of ornate Ottoman balconies and pretty wooden window frames dressed with bougainvillaea or honeysuckle. [SEP] At night the streets here	come	alive with shoppers and revelers, and there are excellent restaurants in some of the old buildings. [SEP] If you exit the harbor from the southwest you can cross busy Odós Arkadíou to traffic-free Odós Petiháki. [SEP] On your left is the Venetian Loggia built in 1600. [SEP] Until recently it was sadly neglected but it has risen like a phoenix from the ashes and now performs the role of an up-market gallery where you can buy excellent copies of museum pieces. [SEP] Walk down Petiháki to find the Rimondi Fountain. [SEP] Built in the 1620s its once fine carvings have taken on an aged patina and it looks strangely out of place among the bright Internet cafés now replacing traditional tavernas in this bustling square.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
own of Villena, the farthest point from Alicante (64 km/39 miles away) on this tour. [SEP] The castle here, noted for its double walls and high, eight-turreted tower rarely found south of Madrid, also has national monument status. [SEP] Villena’s castle was originally built by Moors, though considerable additions were made in the 15th century. [SEP] The town’s priceless Bronze Age treasure, discovered in a clay jar in the riverbed, is exhibited in the Ayuntamiento (Town Hall). [SEP] The gold jewellery and objects attest to the artistry of Villena’s early inhabitants. [SEP] Swing south from Villena along the N-330 to Sax, site of the Roman town of Saxum. [SEP] The towers of the original Roman castle, which has been fully restored, are still a look-out point. [SEP] Back on the N-330 you soon	come	to Petrel’s Moorish castle, reputed to have fabulous treasure buried in its grounds. [SEP] Unrestored medieval fortresses are found along the C-3212 road to Elda, and beyond, at Monóvar. [SEP] Elda itself is noted for excellent wine and lace-making. [SEP] The town was the birthplace of the famous writer, José Martínez Ruiz, better known as Azorín. [SEP] From Elda, follow the signs to Novelda to find yet another Moorish castle set high on a hill. [SEP] This one is the Castillo de la Mola, erected on the site of a Roman fort. [SEP] It has an unusual triangular tower dating from the 13th century.

Before you leave the sanctuary, visit the Capilla Mayor (Main Chapel).

[SEP] Go out of the cathedral on the north side and walk across Plaza Hernandez Amores to the cool and classy Calle de la Trapería (Street of Secondhand Merchants). [SEP] But don’t look for bargains here; the name of this pedestrian thoroughfare belies the elegance of its shops. [SEP] At the north end you	come	upon the Casino (a private club, not a gambling establishment), with spirited turn-of-the century decor. [SEP] The entrance hall, an exact copy of the Hall of Ambassadors in Seville’s Alcázar, and the ladies’ lavatory — with its ceiling of cherubs — are the most magnificent rooms. [SEP] (Don’t forget a small tip to the steward who shows you around.) [SEP] During the Casino’s heyday, the pedestrian Calle de la Platería (Street of Silversmiths), at right angles to the Trapería, was full of practising craftsmen. [SEP] Flower stalls in the Plaza de las Flores are open every morning.

[SEP] Tops on most people’s lists are Cuba’s greatest achievements (not including the national health care system): cigars, rum, and music. [SEP] There is also an excellent selection of handicrafts available at excellent prices in towns and resorts frequented by tourists. [SEP] Tourist markets are now thriving in Cuba’s major centers, even if much of what you’ll find is related to Che Guevara — berets, T-shirts bearing his countenance, and dolls, among many other “revolutionary” items. [SEP] As for essentials, hotel and dollar shops carry mineral water, soap, shampoo, and toothpaste, but many medicinal or cosmetic staples are hard to	come	by; it’s still best to bring all you need from home.

Cayo Largo and the Isle of Youth The two main islands in the Archipiélago de los Canarreos, south of western Cuba, could not be more different. [SEP] Cayo Largo is a tourist enclave where visitors are never more than a few yards from sugar-white sands. [SEP] Yet it’s an antiseptic place, devoid of any Cubans except those who work there. [SEP] By contrast, the Isle of Youth sees virtually no tourists except those at the rather isolated Hotel El Colony (on the small island’s southwestern tip), who	come	exclusively for the superb diving at a nearby beach. [SEP] Cayo Largo, an island 25 km (15.5 miles) long and the most easterly of the Archipiélago de los Canarreos, might be your Caribbean paradise — if all you’re looking for is a dazzling white beach and clear blue seas. [SEP] Other than the miles of beaches, there’s not much else of consequence here except mangrove, scrub, and half a dozen comfortable hotels with a full program of entertainment and watersports. [SEP] Turtles nest in the sand at one end of the island. [SEP] At the other you can go sailing, diving, or deep-sea fishing or take a boat trip to Playa Sirena, an incomparable strip of sand a 10-minute boat ride away, where lobster lunches are available.

[SEP] A more appealing prospect is picturesque Guamá, a half-hour boat ride from La Boca along an artificial channel and then across the vast Laguna del Tesoro (Treasure Lake). [SEP] Legend has it that the Indians dumped their jewels into the water rather than surrender them to Spanish conquistadores. [SEP] Guamá is a group of tiny islands connected by wooden bridges. [SEP] A few visitors stay in the thatched cabañas (see page 131), but most just	come	to wander along the boardwalk, greet the ducks and egrets, and have a meal.

h-caste Hindu origin, ruled in the Kathmandu Valley from about a.d. 330 to 700. [SEP] King Manadeva I (a.d. 462–505) shook off the domination of the India Gupta emperors and extended his kingdom from the Kosi River in the east to the Gandaki River in the west and from the Terai to the Himalayan passes. [SEP] A great king of this line, Amsuvarna (609–621), married his daughter Bhrikuti to the ruler of Tibet, Srongtsen Gampo. [SEP] In 640, Bhrikuti and her Chinese co-wife converted Srongtsen Gampo to Buddhism. [SEP] Bhrikuti is venerated as the “Green Tara” and the Chinese wife as the “White Tara.” [SEP] Their images are prominent in Nepalese Buddhist art. [SEP] Commercial and cultural links with Tibet, and through Tibet with China, were strengthened at this time. [SEP] More reliable records	come	with the next major dynasty, the Malla, who were established in about 1200 by the strongman Ari Malla. [SEP] The Malla came to Nepal in the first of several waves of Hindu fugitives from the 11th-century Muslim invasion of northern India. [SEP] Many of the refugees were nobles of the Chetri warrior caste from Rajasthan; forging new feudal states in Nepal, they were responsible for reinforcing Hinduism at the expense of Buddhism. [SEP] The Kathmandu Valley itself was raided in 1336 by the Muslim Sultan of Bengal. [SEP] In seven days he destroyed both Hindu and Buddhist temples and statues, including Swayambhunath and Pashupatinath. [SEP] These great shrines were later rebuilt and expanded into their present magnificence.

On the Trail Trekking isn’t mountain climbing, but it also isn’t just a stroll in the park. [SEP] It’s walking, with lots of uphills and downhills. [SEP] Almost anyone can go trekking, though a trek is definitely more enjoyable if you’re reasonably fit. [SEP] Sure there are lots of athletes on the trail who seem to be here merely for the challenge, but you’ll also	come	across groups of the less physically fit, including school groups from the international school in Kathmandu and organized senior citizens’ treks, going happily along at their own pace. [SEP] As you hike, whether with a fully loaded backpack or just a light daypack, you can’t help marveling at the burdens that porters carry in their dokos (baskets). [SEP] Everything not made or grown in the villages has to he packed in on the backs of wiry, barefoot porters, who carry loads of as much as 60 kg (130 pounds). [SEP] Even more amazing is the fact that these baskets have no shoulder straps but only tump lines (forehead straps). [SEP] You may notice that going downhill, porters take short steps on the balls of their feet with their knees bent.

White-Water Rafting For heart-in-the-mouth thrills it is hard to beat white-water rafting on the tumultuous snow-fed rivers of Nepal. [SEP] Although trekking is still the favored outdoor adventure here, rafting is a close second. [SEP] Many rafting enthusiasts	come	specifically to paddle this country’s challenging waters, which roar through some of the world’s deepest gorges. [SEP] The knowledge that even the best rafters sometimes capsize in these currents keeps the adrenaline flowing as fast as the river. [SEP] Although there are some easy floats on the lowland rivers, the majority of rafting in Nepal is on Class III through Class V waters, not ideal for neophytes. [SEP] However, plenty of first-timers do get out on the water during their stay in Nepal. [SEP] Rafts usually carry six passengers plus two guides, and the typical rafting trip includes nights spent camping on the riverbank, with the rafting crew setting up camp and preparing all the meals. [SEP] Rafters spend a few hours before lunch riding the rapids and enjoying the spectacular scenery	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
y of Hanuman Dhoka Palace. [SEP] The palace, which now serves primarily as a museum, takes its name from the red-cloaked figure of the monkey god Hanuman that stands to the left of the main palace entrance. [SEP] This stone statue was erected in 1672 and stands atop a squat pillar. [SEP] The statue’s face is entirely obscured by red paste that is smeared on by worshippers. [SEP] Tour guides say the red paste is to spare Hanuman the sight of the goings-on — more acrobatic than erotic — carved on the struts of the small Jaganath Temple opposite. [SEP] When this bit of mythology is related, it immediately sends tour groups trotting across to see what is forbidden to the monkey god. [SEP] Some say the carvings are there for protection, because the goddess of lightning is a virgin who would not	come	near anything so shocking. [SEP] The erotica is probably best explained, however, along with Nepal’s ubiquitous Shiva lingams (phalluses) and the female yoni symbols, as an expression of the creative energy in male-female relations and the pleasure principles of Tantrism. [SEP] In the palace wall beyond the Hanuman statue and protected by a wooden fence is a poem etched in stone in 15 languages dated 14 January 1664. [SEP] It is attributed to King Pratap Malla, reputed to be a great linguist.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
int, continuing to Thahiti Tole, where there is another small stupa, you can walk north to the main intersection of Thamel, Kathmandu’s lively, fast-spreading center for budget-conscious tourists. [SEP] Guest houses, restaurants, curio vendors, rug shops, trekking agencies, bicycle and motorcycle rental stands, and bookshops line the way. [SEP] Some guest houses have pleasant gardens, and most are clean and quite inexpensive, though in recent years more expensive hotels have also opened in this neighborhood. [SEP] Many low-budget guest houses have bulletin boards where trekkers leave messages for friends or advertise for trekking companions. [SEP] From Thamel’s center you can return to your starting point by heading right, or east, to a roundabout. [SEP] Back in the modern part of town you	come	to the Kaiser Library. [SEP] This has nothing to do with the German emperors, but was built by Field-Marshal Kaiser (a distortion of the Nepali name Kesar) Shumshere Rana. [SEP] The tall trees surrounding this building, which also houses part of the Ministry of Education, are the daytime roost of a colony of large fruit bats that trade places at dusk with flocks of crows. [SEP] Inside the library there are old photos of assorted Ranas, smartly dressed in tweed suits, neckties, and polished boots, posing atop the huge rhinos and tigers they’ve slain. [SEP] The royal family lives in the modern Narayanhiti Palace across the street, behind flagpoles bearing the world’s only non-rectangular national flag.

Leaving the square on the lane that begins at the back of the Bhimsen Temple and following the street around to the right will bring you to the Golden Temple, or Kwa Bahal, a Buddhist monastery founded in the 11th century. [SEP] Two painted lions mark the entrance. [SEP] Inside, the monastery surrounds a sunken courtyard with an exquisite golden shrine in the center, backed by a pagoda temple decorated with episodes from the life of Buddha. [SEP] Flanking the steps leading to the courtyard and standing on statues of tortoises are two bronze elephants with praying riders on their backs. [SEP] On the upturned roof corners of the shimmering golden shrine stand bronze birds. [SEP] From the Golden Temple, continue descending the narrow lane and you will	come	to temple complex dominated by a five-tiered pagoda, the Kumbheshwar Temple, which is dedicated to Shiva and dates to 1392.

Bhaktapur (Bhadgaon) Bhaktapur lies 16 km (10 miles) east of the center of Kathmandu. [SEP] Bhaktapur means “City of Devotees,” and this could today be taken to mean devotion to the old ways, for Bhaktapur is even more medieval than Old Kathmandu or Patan. [SEP] Exploring its narrow streets, you’ll	come	upon squares filled with pottery drying in the sun and potters working at their hand-spun wheels, weavers at their looms, and wood-carvers at work on window frames.

From Kathmandu, short trips to the valley rim make it possible for those with limited time to see the high mountains at sunrise or sunset. [SEP] Nagarkot, which stands on the crest of a ridge at 2,195 m (7,200 ft), is about an hour’s drive from Bhaktapur and one of the best places in the Kathmandu area for viewing the Himalayas. [SEP] From this aerie on the rim of the Kathmandu Valley, 322 km (200 miles) of the Himalayas stretch out before you in an immense wall of rock and ice. [SEP] Although there are excellent views from the many lodges and hotels here, the view is even better from a nearby observation tower, which can be reached in about an hour’s walk from Nagarkot. [SEP] From this observation tower, it is possible to see as far as Mount Everest. [SEP] Most visitors	come	for the sunrise or sunset on the mountains, and though the weather is often at its clearest in the early morning, low clouds and fog often obstruct the view. [SEP] The Kathmandu area’s other popular mountain-viewing spot is the village of Dhulikhel, which has a view very similar to that from Nagarkot and is a bit easier to reach, since it is on the main highway to Tibet. [SEP] This highway passes through Banepa, where you can turn off to visit Panauti.

The best way to see the wildlife, and certainly the most fun, is swaying atop a silently padding elephant. [SEP] The elephant grass along the several rivers in the park is so tall that only from an elephant’s back can you spot rhinos, deer, and other creatures, most of which are used to seeing elephants and do not run from them. [SEP] With luck, you’ll see a leopard draped indolently on a tree branch, and perhaps a stately sambar stag. [SEP] In winter, the gaur, the world’s largest wild ox, almost 2 m (6 ft) high at the shoulder,	come	s out of its hideaway in the Siwalik Hills on the park’s southern edge in search of young grass. [SEP] Spotted deer, sloth bear, giant flying squirrels, and civet cats are among the other mammals the visitor may see. [SEP] There are several jungle lodges and tented camps within the park’s boundaries, and from any of these camps there is a very high likelihood that you will see rhinos and deer. [SEP] Tigers, leopards, and sloth bears are a bit more elusive. [SEP] All of these lodges, and even some outside the park, have their own elephants and nature guides. [SEP] On a stay at one of these lodges, a half day is usually spent in dug-out canoes searching for endangered gharials, a narrow jawed fish-eating crocodile, and their flesh-eating cousins, the huge marsh muggers.

EP] This well-watered farming zone stretches the length of the country on its southern border with India. [SEP] It’s only about 40 km (25 miles) wide, but a third of Nepal’s population lives here, producing much of the nation’s food. [SEP] A visit to Lumbini, birthplace of Gautama Buddha, can also be made in about three hours from Chitwan. [SEP] (There are also flights from Kathmandu to Bhairawa, the nearest airfield, with a bus service to Lumbini.) [SEP] The story goes that Buddha’s mother gave birth to him under a tree in a garden at Lumbini, unable to get back in time to the palace, some 20 km (12 miles) away. [SEP] Marking the spot is a pillar commemorating the visit in 250 b.c. of the Indian emperor Ashoka, a zealous convert to Buddhism. [SEP] Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world	come	to Lumbini, and in recent years the site has been developed into an international cultural and religious park with several hotels and numerous Buddhist temples built by the world’s various Buddhist countries. [SEP] Although few tourists stray from the Kathmandu-Pokhara-Chitwan focal points, it is possible to see something of the undeveloped west without walking three weeks to get there. [SEP] There are now several lodges at Royal Bardia National Park on the Karnali River. [SEP] This park was created specifically as a preserve for tigers, which, with a little luck, can be seen here more easily than at Chitwan National Park.

The Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1762 brought a shattering blow to the population of Louisiana. [SEP] Overnight, it appeared, they had been handed over to King Charles III of Spain — though the treaty was not announced until 1764. [SEP] It all made perfect sense to King Louis XV, cousin of Charles (both were Bourbons), for the French and Indian War, known in Europe as the Seven Years War, had been disastrous for French interests abroad. [SEP] Britain won Canada and everything east of the Mississippi, including Spanish Florida. [SEP] To Louis, Louisiana was now isolated in a British-ruled part of the world, a money-losing outpost that seemed to have no future. [SEP] It must have	come	as an almost unbearable shock to the patriotic Frenchmen of New Orleans to be told that they were Spanish citizens. [SEP] Waiting for the first Spanish governor to arrive put a huge strain on the disillusioned society. [SEP] When Governor Antonio de Ulloa finally sailed up the Mississippi in 1766, four years after the treaty was signed, a crashing storm erupted, as if an omen for the climate ahead. [SEP] The governor, a scholarly retired naval officer with good intentions, was accompanied by a contingent of 80 Spanish soldiers, most of retirement age. [SEP] The high-society frolics of the Vaudreuil era were over; the Spanish governor’s wife froze out the Creole ladies of New Orleans from official invitation lists.

The cinema is a great national passion, with over 300 different films showing in Paris every week. [SEP] For undubbed versions with French subtitles, look out for the letters VO (version originale) in listings or posters. [SEP] Cinemas on the Champs-Elysées, in Montparnasse, St-Germain-des-Prés, Bastille, and the Forum des Halles all show VO movies. [SEP] Keeping up with the latest in discos and clubs can be a full-time job for professional night-owls: there’s no point in turning up before midnight. [SEP] Many are nominally private, which means you only get in if the doormen like the way you look. [SEP] Some expensive, exclusive examples hide out around the Champs-Elysées, such as Régine’s in the rue de Ponthieu. [SEP] Louder, less expensive, younger, and weirder places	come	and go around Bastille and Oberkampf. [SEP] There’s still some life in St-Germain-des-Prés and the Latin Quarter, especially in university term time — making local friends is the best way to find it. [SEP] Pop and rock concerts are held at the spectacular Zénith in the Parc de la Villette (métro: Porte de Pantin), at Parc-des-Princes (métro: Porte de St-Cloud), and also the Palais Omnisport de Bercy (métro: Bercy). [SEP] Ticket offices (billeteries) at FNAC or Virgin Megastore, both on the Champs-Elysées, will show what groups are in town.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhatToDo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
The French take their jazz seriously, and Paris has many jazz clubs. [SEP] Hot Brass (La Villette) and The New Morning (rue des Petites-Ecuries) attract big American and European musicians, while Le Dunois (rue Dunois) is an intimate place, cultivating more avant-garde music. [SEP] The Lionel Hampton club at the Méridien Etoile (Porte Maillot) has a full program of guest performers. [SEP] The old-established Caveau de la Huchette (rue de la Huchette in St-Germain-des-Prés) opens every night at 9:30pm for listening and dancing to a small combo or big band swing or bebop. [SEP] Entrance prices of around 60–120F may include your first drink; extra drinks cost 30–60F. [SEP] In the realm of classical music, Paris has	come	back into its own, with many fine concerts at Salle Pleyel and Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, opera at the new Opéra-Bastille, and the ballet at the Opéra-Garnier. [SEP] In all cases, some seats are reasonably priced, though they tend to go quickly. [SEP] Look out for free concerts in churches. [SEP] Modern dance is enjoying a revival, with a new wave of small, imaginative companies beginning modestly enough at the Café de la Danse (passage Louis-Philippe) and Théâtre Garnier before reaching the heights of the Théâtre de la Bastille.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhatToDo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
. [SEP] Cistercian monks protested that such a sumptuous structure was an insult to the godly virtue of poverty, and today, architectural purists still find Notre-Dame a bit “too much.” [SEP] It was, however, built to inspire awe. [SEP] Over its long history, the cathedral has witnessed many momentous occasions. [SEP] In 1239, there was the procession of Louis IX, barefoot, carrying his holy treasure, Jesus’s Crown of Thorns (now in the Sainte-Chapelle); in 1430, it saw the humiliation of Henry VI of England (he was crowned King of France here; see page 15). [SEP] And in 1594, it was where Henri IV made his cynical conversion to Catholicism, a move that reinforced his hold on the French throne. [SEP] Napoléon chose it as the setting for crowning himself emperor (upstaging the Pope, who had	come	to Paris expecting to do it). [SEP] In modern times, it has been a place for celebrating victory and mourning the passing of France’s leaders. [SEP] General de Gaulle marked the 1944 Liberation of Paris with a mass here, and in 1970 his death was similarly commemorated. [SEP] In 1996, a funeral service was held for de Gaulle’s archrival François Mitterrand here.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
oyal, Les Halles was for centuries the site of the capital’s central food markets (now in a more spacious, if less colorful, location at Rungis, near Orly). [SEP] To widespread regret, Victor Baltard’s great cast-iron and glass pavilions were torn down in the 1970s. [SEP] Eventually, gardens, children’s playgrounds, and the maze-like, partly below-ground shopping mall, Forum des Halles, transformed the site. [SEP] Saturdays bring throngs of teenagers from the suburbs to shop, watch films, roller skate, munch fast food, and just hang out. [SEP] The liveliest meeting place is around the monumental Renaissance Fontaine des Innocents (once part of a cemetery). [SEP] Bars, restaurants, and late-night brasseries line the adjoining rue Berger and the streets leading off it. [SEP] Clubs and discos	come	alive at midnight and stay open to dawn, especially on weekends. [SEP] Away from the gardens and playgrounds, the quarter has its seedy side: drink and drugs, pickpockets and prostitutes. [SEP] Rue St-Denis, once primarily a red-light district, is now pedestrianized, but still has its share of sex shops. [SEP] The remarkable church of St-Eustache dominates the north side of Les Halles. [SEP] Built from 1532 to 1637, the main structure is late Gothic with a somewhat incongruous but imposing Renaissance colonnade on its western façade. [SEP] The church is renowned for its choral concerts and recitals on the grand organ designed by Baltard, architect of Les Halles.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
f modern construction. [SEP] It provides a remarkably authentic record of the development of the city, from the reign of Henri IV at the end of the 16th century to the advent of the Revolution. [SEP] Built on reclaimed marshland, as its name suggests, the Marais contains some of Europe’s most elegant Renaissance mansions (hôtels), many of which now serve as museums and libraries. [SEP] The one major change is the recent influx of trendy boutiques. [SEP] Take the métro to Rambuteau and start at the corner of the rue des Archives and the rue des Francs-Bourgeois, named after the poor (not bourgeois at all) allowed to live here tax-free in the 14th century. [SEP] The national archives are stored in an 18th-century mansion, Hôtel de Soubise. [SEP] Across a vast, horseshoe-shaped courtyard, you	come	across the exquisite Rococo style of Louis XV’s time in the apartments of the Prince and Princess of Soubise. [SEP] Up on the first floor is the Musée de l’Histoire de France, with gems such as the only known portrait of Joan of Arc painted in her lifetime and the diary kept by Louis XVI. [SEP] His entry for 14 July 1789, the day the Bastille was stormed, reads Rien (Nothing). [SEP] A garden (not always open to the public) connects the Hôtel de Soubise with its twin, Hôtel de Rohan, on the rue Vieille du Temple. [SEP] Look out for Robert le Lorrain’s fine Les Chevaux d’Apollon over the old stables in the second courtyard, admired as one of France’s most beautiful 18th-century sculptures.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Musée du Louvre Revamping the Musée du Louvre since the 1980s has made this formidable palace of art far more accessible, in all senses.

Lourenço” — indicating the turn-off to São Lourenço do Matto (Church of St. Lawrence of the Woods). [SEP] Inside is one of the most extraordinary displays of azulejo design you’ll ever see. [SEP] Every square inch of the Baroque, 15th-century church — its walls, vaulted ceiling, and cupola — is covered with hand-painted, blue-and-white ceramic tiles. [SEP] Most date from the early 18th century and depict biblical scenes detailing the life of St. Lawrence. [SEP] The ensemble is a stunning sight, not to be missed. [SEP] Loulé, north of Almancil, is a prosperous town known for its leather, lace, and copper goods. [SEP] Tour groups	come	from far and wide to shop at the colorful, bustling market. [SEP] Just below the permanent market halls on the main Praça da República, you’ll find a well-preserved section of the medieval castle walls (which were much damaged by the 1755 earthquake). [SEP] Also worth visiting are the Igreja Matriz (São Clemente), a 13th-century Gothic church with 18th-century azulejo tiles; the Convento da Graça, with a terrific Manueline portal; and Ermida de Nossa Senhora da Conceição, a small church prized for its Baroque altar and ceramic tiles.

[SEP] The parish church (which also goes by the name of Nossa Senhora do Rosário) was founded by King Dom Pedro II in 1698. [SEP] The small chapel at the rear, Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos (Our Lady of the Afflicted), is where women often pray when their fishermen husbands are away at sea. [SEP] Instead of the red-tiled roofs and filigreed chimneys seen elsewhere in the Algarve, the Olhão skyline comprises flat-topped roofs of terraces called açoeitas.

re chafing under the yoke of colonial rule and the bitter system of slavery. [SEP] To squash subversive ideas about independence in Puerto Rico, Madrid imposed ruthless military control. [SEP] The most memorable incident occurred in 1868 in the mountain town of Lares, when government forces crushed an uprising of secessionists, killing or jailing the insurgents, and many innocent victims. [SEP] The event is remembered as El Grito de Lares (the cry of Lares). [SEP] The colonial government could not, however, hold back the tide of change sweeping the Caribbean. [SEP] In 1872, one momentous decree abolished the 350-year-old institution of slavery in Puerto Rico, and in 1897 Spain cut the colonial ties and finally granted the island autonomy. [SEP] The long dream of independence seemed to have	come	true. [SEP] But eight months after Madrid had authorized home rule for Puerto Rico, American troops arrived to take it away. [SEP] The Spanish-American War was no great challenge for the US force that landed at Guánica, on Puerto Rico’s calm south coast, rather than at fortified San Juan. [SEP] Military resistance was spotty at best. [SEP] By starting at the soft underbelly, the 16,000 troops of General Nelson A. Miles gained control of the island in less than three weeks. [SEP] The central issue that had drawn Spain and the United States into war — Cuba’s struggle for independence — was resolved in that island’s favor: Cuba’s freedom was guaranteed by the Paris Treaty of 1898.

[SEP] Follow Calle Beneficencia, the street leading off the right side of the barracks, back towards town. [SEP] You’ll soon	come	to a small square on your left with a huge totemic sculpture. [SEP] This is Plaza del Quinto Centenario (Quincentenary Square). [SEP] The sculpture symbolizes the 500 years of Puerto Rico’s existence. [SEP] On close inspection, Amerindian and Spanish themes can be seen, but some elements are a little obscure. [SEP] Walk on to reach another small square, Plaza San José (San José Square), one of the gems of the city. [SEP] Situated close to El Morro, it was once one of the most important squares in San Juan. [SEP] In the center is a statue of Juan Ponce de León in full regalia that was cast in 1797 from the iron of a British cannon, confiscated after their unsuccessful attack on the city. [SEP] Edged by historic buildings, the square has changed little since the 17th century, except that many	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1

ace of staggering proportions: there are over 200 species of native trees. [SEP] One specimen is said to be over 2,500 years old; some trees are so wide it takes several people to reach around them; others soar hundreds of feet into the air. [SEP] The forest gets over 180 inches (41���2 m) of rain each year — that’s some 100 billion gallons (450 billion liters) of water. [SEP] The animals that live here are also amazing. [SEP] This is one of the last habitats of the threatened Puerto Rican parrot. [SEP] The infamous coquí (see page 47)is, of course, heard everywhere. [SEP] All in all, the park in an impressive sight, with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance. [SEP] Arriving via Route 191 you’ll	come	right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park. [SEP] This facility presents important information about the history of the park, its plant and animal species, and its role in the local ecology. [SEP] You can then travel on higher into the park, toward the summit. [SEP] You can’t drive the whole 8 miles (13 km) between the visitors center and the end of the road, but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way, so there’s ample access. [SEP] Two popular stops are La Coca Falls, on the right after the 5-mile (8-km) point, and the Yokahú Observation Tower, at the 51⁄2-mile (9-km) point. [SEP] Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes. [SEP] The most spectacular cascade in the park, La Mina Falls, is just a 30-minute walk from the roadside, via Big Tre	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Culebra, much smaller at 21 sq miles (34 sq km), is north of Vieques. [SEP] It is the largest rock in a collection of over twenty that attract sailors and divers from the main island. [SEP] Culebra was known as the Spanish Virgin Island until the American takeover — it lies halfway between Puerto Rico and St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. [SEP] Its only town is named Dewey, after Admiral George Dewey, a hero of the American-Spanish War of 1898. [SEP] The local people are more apt to call it Pueblo. [SEP] Culebra is full of natural beauty: beaches (Flamenco is the most celebrated), clear waters full of marine life, and land awash with flowers. [SEP] Most people	come	just to sit on the beach or walk in the fresh air. [SEP] Much of the island is now managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, to preserve the environment. [SEP] It makes an interesting day trip from Puerto Rico and a total contrast to hot days in the streets of Old San Juan.

Puerto Rico’s second city, Ponce is as much steeped in history as Old San Juan. [SEP] Founded in 1692, it was named after a relative of Juan Ponce de León, not the famous explorer himself. [SEP] Ponce is a thriving port city, very modern in many ways, but it lives up to its name of “Pearl of the South.” [SEP] At the very heart of the city is a jewel of an old town, well-preserved thanks to a massive and expensive restoration program begun in the 1980s. [SEP] Hundreds of careworn buildings were brought back to life, and power cables were buried underground and out of sight. [SEP] Along with this physical transformation came a cultural change: Ponce has be	come	a focus for social events that celebrate Puerto Rican history and tradition; several major festivals are held here throughout the year. [SEP] The focus of the city is Parque Degetau in Plaza Las Delicias (Delight Square), known by most locals as Plaza de Ponce. [SEP] Most of what you want to see is within a few minutes’ walk of this plaza, and cafés and restaurants for refreshments are also near at hand. [SEP] You can spend a wonderful morning just soaking in the atmosphere. [SEP] The park, with its shady trees, cooling fountains, and somber bronze statues, including one of Luis Muñoz Marín, is where people	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
p to 7 ft (2 m) long — congregate here because they’ve learned they’ll be well supplied with tasty tidbits offered by the humans on shore. [SEP] North of Ponce are attractions of a different kind. [SEP] Take Route 503 out of town — this road runs along the banks of the Río Portuguéz — and after about a mile and a half (2 km) you’ll arrive at the Tibes Indian Ceremonial Park, one of the most important Amerindian archaeological sites in the Caribbean. [SEP] The ceremonial site and cemetery are across the river, and you may not enter without a guide. [SEP] A small museum explains the known history of the Amerindian races; it has a number of cabinets holding artifacts, as well as a skeleton, still in the traditional fetal burial position. [SEP] Once you’re into the park, the ceremonial grounds	come	into view. [SEP] Open spaces discovered since the 1960s are now believed to be used for “ball games,” which had an important though as yet only poorly understood ceremonial purpose in Indian culture. [SEP] High in the hills behind Ponce is Hacienda Buena Vista. [SEP] To get there, take Route 10, a major north-south artery. [SEP] The road climbs steeply into dense vegetation and cooler air before you see signs for the hacienda; the climate and environmental conditions here were ideal for the coffee that the plantation began to grow more than 150 years ago. [SEP] The plantation fell into neglect in the 20th century, but since 1984 it has been returned to its original state by The Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico. [SEP] Agricultural machinery such as coffee bean huskers can be seen in the ori	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
Mexico’s folkloric traditions have be	come	the centerpiece of the modern “Mexican Fiesta,” created especially with the tourist in mind. [SEP] These full evenings of entertainment generally include a makeshift marketplace featuring artesanía for sale, a buffet Mexican dinner, games (involving drinking large quantities of tequila), mariachi music, a presentation of folkloric dance from around the country, and a generous supply of margaritas and other beverages. [SEP] Most of the time these are smallish presentations, with dances performed by amateur groups; at their worst, they can be truly gaudy and almost laughable shows. [SEP] The exception is in Acapulco. [SEP] The Centro de Convenciones offers arguably the best Fiesta Mexicana in the country, and is the closest you’ll	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	5
rowded, and feature recorded music for dancing. [SEP] The Latin music clubs get going around 10pm, and don’t even show up before midnight at the techno and alternative clubs. [SEP] The majority of clubs, and the ubiquitous Carlos ‘n’ Charlie’s, are located along the main boulevard, Miguel de la Madrid. [SEP] In Ixtapa, sunset happy hours offer the most options, and Mexican fiestas seem to be a “best bet” for a complete evening. [SEP] Other later night offerings are a sampling of what you’ll find in any resort town in Mexico: Christine’s disco at the Krystal Hotel, Sr. [SEP] Frogs, and Carlos ‘n’ Charlie’s. [SEP] The only really original option here is the club, La Valentina, a combination restaurant/video bar with a desert-inspired décor. [SEP] There is no doubt that Acapulco rules when it	come	s to nightlife.

[SEP] (3) 222-1875). [SEP] If you like the adventure of traveling through the jungle, Vallarta Adventure in Puerto Vallarta, offers an extraordinary tour of the Sierra Madre Mountains on board Mercedes Benz all-terrain vehicles (called Unimogs). [SEP] The tour includes a visit to a secluded beach and a detailed explanation of the flora and fauna of the area. [SEP] Lovers of speed and thrill-seekers will enjoy the fast-paced tour along the Papagayo River, 72 km (48 miles) north of Acapulco. [SEP] Shotover-Jet (Tel.

[SEP] To say that it’s a rush is an understatement, and their eco-conscious pamphlet is good for a chuckle, considering the reality of the experience. [SEP] They are, however, making new rafting excursions available for those who prefer to experience the Papagayo River a little closer to its natural state.

ian, funky feel. [SEP] This part of town also is home to “Restaurant Row” (along Basilio Badillo) and Rockin’ Row (Ignacio L. Vallarta, just beyond the southbound bridge). [SEP] This perpendicular meeting of streets contains something for every taste and budget, in both dining and nightlife. [SEP] Immediately south of Viejo Vallarta is the fashionable residential neighborhood of Conchas Chinas, with numerous villas for rent, and a few hotels set into the cliffside. [SEP] Extending from Conchas Chinas along the South Shore, the landscape changes to dramatic mountains that tumble toward the sea. [SEP] Tucked into the private coves of this coast, you’ll find a collection of full-service hotels made to order for honeymoons and romantic escapes. [SEP] At the end of this stretch of shore, you’ll	come	to Mismaloya Bay, where you can still climb up the ridge to the ruins of the set built for the Night of the Iguana.

Though Acapulco is, admittedly, past its prime, there are still plenty of reasons to visit and numerous ways to enjoy the famously sunny days there. [SEP] Acapulco remains Mexico’s most traditional resort for those looking for a beach, yet also want to feel as if they’ve been to Mexico. [SEP] Where other resorts in Mexico have been accused of being homogenized to meet the tastes of North American travelers, Acapulco remains true to her essence, from the cacophony of families filling colorful, public sands, to the classically late nights in glitzy clubs. [SEP] And Acapulco has one thing that no other place has — the absolutely stunning view of Acapulco Bay, which, day or night, is an image as memorable as any you’ll	come	across in your travels. [SEP] Acapulco is more of a city than other Pacific coastal destinations, with high-rise hotels lined up like dominoes around the edge of the bay. [SEP] It offers more options for dining, shopping, and other activities than anywhere else along Mexico’s western shoreline; many are geared for families.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	1
