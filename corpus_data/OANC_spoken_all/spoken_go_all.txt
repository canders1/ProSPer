Oh.<n>Lot of times we just sit around and just reminisce and go back to the time when we were growing up.<n>Family, um.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsElissa.txt
It was?<n>Um, now why did you decide to stay in Charlotte to go to school?<n>Um, I wanted to be closer to my family, number one, and, um, number two, I have a lot of friends coming here, which helped me a lot, and, um, I just liked the Charlotte, um, UNC Charlotte because I wanted to be a, a nurse.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt
Even though I had freedom when I was, you know, home, whatever, but I still had a curfew.<n>But here in college you don't have, I mean you can do what you want to, come and go as you please.<n>Uh, you don't have to answer to anybody except yourself.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt
Work hard study balance your time, you know.<n>You can go out on the weekends but during the week it, you know, it should be study time.<n>Well thank you for sharing your experience with me.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt
However, it didn't seem to be so horrifying.<n>It was a story and I, you know, you knew it was fiction, but I would go back and read, when I could read myself, I read everything.<n>I read the backs of cereal boxes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt
I just really didn't ever love poetry for some reason.<n>I still recall, and I'm sure your mother does too "Whose woods these are, I think I know His house is in the village though;" and I won't go beyond that but, uh, you recall that Gail, when we were, when I was in college and we were first dating that was a, a favorite poem of, uh, us and our friends.<n>Was that self-written?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt
So, that was such a racy and shocking book at that time, and so, of course, we had to read it.<n>I. I liked, uh, oh gosh, go ahead Dave you've got--<n>Well, I remember another book that you read that that I didn't read but that, uh, painting was made `84?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt
So you couldn't tell what kind, at night, what kind of people were going by, but you could hear clatter, because even beasts full of weapons, with, everything, you know?<n>So that time, that I told you about when the, the soldiers came, my son escaped, dying, from fear, when I go that they had me at gunpoint, and they surrounded the house, but it passed, they didn't do anything.<n>The next time the soldiers, came through, the guerrillas were in front of the house, in the road, there's one, of those huge rocks, that you can sit on, and when they were eating.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
So, I came in, from where I was washing, I went in, and I didn't see what the guerrillas did with themselves, because I didn't see, they were in front, but since I went it, I didn't see.<n>Then, you know, that in order to keep yourself out of trouble, you go in and don't, then they come, or, that was another time, that I suffered a terrible threat when the soldiers come through.<n>And he said, "Ma'am," he said, "what did the guerrillas that were there eating do with themselves?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
So he says, "No, from the school up, are all guerrillas."<n>I said, "The fact, you, I, you can be there," I said, "or I can stay here and you go in," I said, "you don't see where I get off to."<n>Then they left, they left for the mountain, they went on up.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
He says, "And it's going to be very dangerous and it's very late."<n>So, I said to him, "Oh, well, I'm going to go when it's morning."<n>My son was already two, not even two years old, like, like about, like a year and a half.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
So, my brother said, "I'm going to cut her rope, I'm not going to be able to untie her," he said, "Because it's really difficult with, by the time I untie her, they'll kill me," he says.<n>"I'm going to cut it with the, a knife, the knot, so the cow can go and she won't die."<n>Then, he, is, when, a shell like this<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
That's how it was, it was said, but thank God in the family hardly-- The guerrillas also took out a man from the outskirts near the, the place where we lived, who was called Juan.<n>He was like a catequist, one of those people who helps the priests, and according to the guerrillas, they say that he was starting to get them in trouble with the army, I mean, he started to say where they were, so that the soldiers would go directly to where they were, and one day they (guerrillas) took him out and killed him.<n>And they put out the, the word that yes, they had killed him.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
Because it was more diverse.<n>Like in most schools in Charlotte, if you go on other sides, it's like everybody's just white, but in my school, there was every kind of person you could ever meet.<n>So, I haven't met one person at UNC-Charlotte that I didn't meet in my high school.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
Yeah.<n>Unless I'm like, when I go home for like Christmas break, after being there for like two weeks, it was like I'd never moved out and we get kind of like tense with each other.<n>Basically because we both, um, always think we're right.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
Uh, funny.<n>Actually my first semester at Charlotte, I was a Pre-Business major to go into Marketing and Advertising, because I did that in high school, too.<n>But I never wanted to do that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
Because I'm like a lifeguard every summer and this year I had to get a winter job all year.<n>And it's hard to go from having like your whole day to go to classes and do whatever you want to do and space out everything then like having to like drive across town and go to work.<n>Just to be able to have a job, because I'm not a big work fan.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
To have something to fall back on and everything like that.<n>And I'm like, I'm trying to convince him to, you know, if I don't make it and there's a strong possibility I won't, I know that, I'm not stupid, I'm nor going to go to L.A. and make five million or more than that--<n>Right.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
Right.<n>And do all that, and I mean, if I don't make it, my life's not going to be over or something, like I can't go back to school.<n>So you'll go back to school if that doesn't work out?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
And do all that, and I mean, if I don't make it, my life's not going to be over or something, like I can't go back to school.<n>So you'll go back to school if that doesn't work out?<n>Yeah.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
But he realizes it's not like that.<n>He could go and make more his self if he would get off his butt and do it.<n>What does he do?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
Yeah.<n>Like neither, like I'm the first one in my family to go to college on my dad's side.<n>That must be a really big deal.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
I think that's why they expect so much more of me.<n>It kind of gets tiring and that's what I don't like, you know, I don't like to talk about myself when I go around my family.<n>You know they're all like, "Oh good!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
So that'll-- TAPE 1, SIDE B<n>--work on stage and then go to L.A. and work in movies to begin with, anyway.<n>So you wouldn't stay in Charlotte?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
Like, I mean, if let's say, I make it really big, you know, big, famous person or whatever, I'll live here.<n>And then I'll go and everything like that, when I'm big enough to make my decisions on, when people are sending me scripts by then instead of me having to like audition and stuff.<n>You have a good attitude about it, though!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
That's good, though, you need to, I guess.<n>You can't go into it and be like, "Oh!<n>I'm going to be a big movie star one day!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt
So when I graduate, more than likely I'll move to Boston, but Charlotte has definitely been a nice place to live.<n>I've never experienced any problems with crime or anything like that, and there's always been something for me to do, like in high school or in college, there's always things to go do, so it's been a nice place to grow up.<n>Do you think it will be strange to move up north when you've lived in Charlotte all your life?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt
So, I don't know.<n>If you want to move so bad, why did you go to school here?<n>Uh, the reason I choose to go to school here is because my parents live around 30 minutes away, and I wanted to be away from home, yet be able to go home, if I needed to, so--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt
If you want to move so bad, why did you go to school here?<n>Uh, the reason I choose to go to school here is because my parents live around 30 minutes away, and I wanted to be away from home, yet be able to go home, if I needed to, so--<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt
Very close to my family.<n>I usually go home once or twice a month.<n>Don't you think that will be hard if you move all the way up there, not seeing them as much?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt
Charlotte's a good city, it's expanding and it's getting better.<n>UNCC is a good school, it's probably the right size, I wouldn't want to go to a bigger school so--.<n>I enjoy UNC-Charlotte.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt
First Grade.<n>And what school do you go to?<n>Christian Academy.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeIII.txt
I'm maybe, I'm maybe nine, 10 years old and uh, of all these adults assembled there not one of them had a pair of pliers or a wrench.<n>I fortunately remembered when Mom and I left to go to the church to bring a wrench and couple pairs of pliers because of course the pews were bolted to the floor.<n>This as a young child kind of stunned me you know that we're going to go evacuate pews from a church and we're not going to bring any tools with us of course this was predating Makita battery tools looking back in retrospect we could have used Makita tools would have been far more productive but carrying the pews out of that church and loading them in that truck and by the time we got done the trailer wheels were covered with water and uh, we just kind of made it by the skin of our teeth that we got everything out of there.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt

Uh-huh.<n>You'd go down to this big stainless steel vat that was would hold a thousand gallons of milk then you'll pull the lid of this vat and lower you're kettle down in to it.<n>Ice cold milk and uh, pull it out of course it was whole milk and cream on top.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
So she, we would always fuss about her sitting with us but anyway this one morning I putting siding dad and I are putting siding on her house and nobody come to the door.<n>The door was unlocked and I had to get the windows open, so I just kind of go cruising through the house upstairs try to find my way to the window.<n>Well that window happened to be through her room, so I just kind of walked on through the room and she looked up at me and I said, "Good morning," and she just screamed.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
We were helping my niece and nephew paint a new house that they bought and uh, he uh, little Raymond was with us.<n>He said, "Daddy I have to go poo-poo."<n>And I said, "Well son the Port-o-john is way down there in the neighborhood.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
Because that was, we would wake up at, at six in the morning.<n>We'd be sitting there waiting on daylight to be able to go to work.<n>Couldn't some mornings, couldn't even see just hoping that it would be cooler.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
Right.<n>Oh lord, she's running around carrying on well, Dad makes the mistake of looking at his wound and his knees go out from under him.<n>He buckles down onto the floor.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
OK.<n>Umm, go ahead and tell me about a story.<n>Well I can remember as a small child probably between the ages of three and seven going to Asheville and visiting my grandmother umm and my grandfather but he died when I was fairly young so I mostly remember visiting my grandmother.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CaseCullen.txt
Uh, it was pretty much a kitchen a front room and two-bedroom house one bathroom.<n>The uh neighborhood she lived in was very uh quiet mostly older people and uh we used to go around the neighborhood and visit a lot of her old friends.<n>Um one couple in particular the Blankenships had a apple tree in their back yard and we would go and we would pick apples and take them back to her place and make apple pies.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CaseCullen.txt

You're not going to hear yourself on the tape.<n>( ) OK go ahead.<n>OK Adam is now going to talk<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt
Hold on.<n>OK go ahead.<n>The music industry.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt
Specifically, I mean, if you want to work at, work at one of these places, they, they, uh, generally have a lot of free help, so, uh, you're not going to make a whole lot of money doing this and they expect you to put in a full time schedule so you really can't work another job.<n>But at any rate, I had this, this freedom and, um, the girl had come into my life to, to go and pursue this dream, so, um, I started working at place called D&D Studios, which was known for doing, um, a lot of hip hop music, kind of stuff similar to what I was interested in and I was hoping I'd be able to make some, some connections at least, maybe do a little bit of networking there, and, uh, I met some pretty cool people, did some really kind of really interesting projects, um, but--<n>What kinds of people?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt
Tiring?<n>Yeah, I mean, it was kind a it was rough especially on a young marriage when, when you go into work at six p.m.<n>, you know, basically crossing paths on the way out as, as Kim was coming in and get to work stay at work until five a.m.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt
, you know, basically crossing paths on the way out as, as Kim was coming in and get to work stay at work until five a.m.<n>come home as Kim was getting up and getting ready for work, go to sleep, she goes to work, I wake up, eat, shower and all that good stuff, and then, uh, she's coming home and I'm going out again.<n>After doing that for a couple of weeks it's kind of like, "Damn," you know.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt
Was there a particular place for reading that you had when you were a child?<n>I loved to go outside.<n>Our neighbors had a big pasture.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
Our neighbors had a big pasture.<n>So actually I'd go sit in the pasture and read.<n>Sun or freezing, I loved it!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
And she would say, "Now that told you that...<n>," and she would go on.<n>But she would, if she was talking about rabbits, she would jump around and she's up there and she's put socks on some kind of wires and made little rabbit ears out of them, and, you know?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
And he was like, "I'm heading down to Ventura Blvd," or whatever.<n>And she'd say, well, "Don't go past such and such because the, the bridge is out."<n>There were reports, and, and after I got home<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
She was 7 months pregnant.<n>Had to go to the restroom every ten minutes.<n>Finally, I said, "Look," you know, "we got to scrounge up the flashlight," because, you know, there were no lights in the bathroom, no anything.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
Uh-huh.<n>I said, "Well, go up there.<n>You can use the bathroom right there, instead of going," you know.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
But uh, you know, my and, and, when I got out there to where the little dock was at for the paper, I could see my van.<n>I parked right beside this great big tree, and all that while I worried about my van, but not enough to where I was going to go out there and move it.<n>You know?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
Uh-huh.<n>And so, every little bit, I would go and stick my head out the door and, "The van's OK!"<n>Well, of course I worked twelve hour shift three days a week or three nights a week and that, I guess about seven o'clock was when the, the when the next people were supposed to come in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
And I didn't know any back roads.<n>I didn't know how to go around and try and find.<n>So I just pulled the van over and at the plant parking lot and I got out and started walking and I was just, I can remember live wires being everywhere, crackling and popping.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
Yeah.<n>But, no, Hugo, we had to go to Howard Johnson's or something.<n>No the Hickory Motor Inn!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt

The reading another one point book, she's going to get, say she gets a 100 on it, she's still only got one-point-nine and she had to have two points.<n>So, every week it seems like I have to go to the library and get these little point-five books as, I call them "fillers," just to fill in.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
And the guard was, the inmate was talking about, he said, you know, he said, "They think that it's not, we're not being punished enough.<n>Like when we got to go outside to the exercise yard."<n>He said, "But if you don't think that it's not punishment.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
It's beautiful and that's why it's called The Rock; it literally looks like a big rock just popped out of the ocean and just, you know, water all the way around it.<n>I mean, I'd like to go sometime, but it's not on my "Great To-Do list" or anything.<n>It's wonderful!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt

You got to go!<n>I want to go to CO for the Grand Canyon and all that.<n>Yeah.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
There's a lot, in fact, telling about San Francisco is my favorite spot, that's my problem, see.<n>I get to travel so infrequently that when I do get to go, I'm always thinking, "Well maybe, I'd love to go do this and this and this."<n>And I think, "Well, what if I go and I don't have as much fun as I would if I had gone to," you know?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
I get to travel so infrequently that when I do get to go, I'm always thinking, "Well maybe, I'd love to go do this and this and this."<n>And I think, "Well, what if I go and I don't have as much fun as I would if I had gone to," you know?<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt

You had everything you needed.<n>You didn't have to go into the city.<n>Right.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
Right.<n>You could go into the city for something special, you know, that was just there, but everyday living, you could just stay in Schaumburg and never to leave.<n>That's one thing I liked about San Francisco.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
And all those are right there within walking distance.<n>Then you take a cable car and go to Chinatown.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt
And still that's not that far, but after walking up and down those hills!<n>You are ready for bed when you go to bed that night!<n>But it is absolutely wonderful!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt

Um.<n>This is a story that my dad told me when I was small, a long time ago that, there was a girl that, she was very young, she was going to go visit her parents.<n>And she was like driving on a curve.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CorderoRosalinda.txt
But, that he brought her two days later and that's what happened.<n>And every year she comes out at night and asks people for rides home because she never get, she never got a chance to go visit her, her parents.<n>Before she died.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CorderoRosalinda.txt
Was there anything that I failed to ask that I should have, relating to this story that you've told, or background to the story that you've told?<n>No, I would want to thank you for asking me those questions though, because it's given me the opportunity to go back to a very precious place, to feel her love really, really present, and, um,<n>you know, that makes me smile all over.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CottonGloria.txt

And uh, you know we were all fired up.<n>We came up to uh, newspaper mailbox that was plastic and we lit that on fire, we actually set a couple of those on fire, and uh, I mean by this time, I mean you could, the sun, you could almost see the sun coming up so we run as fast as we can to get back to Craig's house and we sneak back into the back window and uh, we go to sleep.<n>OK, we uh, went to sleep and uh, about an hour and a half later about 8:00 in the morning uh, Craig's mom comes in to wake us up and says there's two guys that want to see us at the front door.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
We denied it, and uh, the old man said, the old man asked us, you know, "Did you," I mean he said, "Did you or did you not sneak out and burn any mailboxes?"<n>And we just denied the whole thing, you know, and uh, finally the old man says, "Well you know I wouldn't have never thought it was y'all but, uh, seeing it was snowing last night and uh, foot tracks go all the way from my mailbox to this house right here uh, I don't have any choice but to believe it was y'all."<n>And uh, he said, "Especially the fellow that was wearing these soles that say Vivran on them," and uh, Craig has his boots sitting by the door and looked on the bottom of them and had, uh, the sole had, uh, was written, it said Vivran on the bottom of it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
, I live out on Moss Lake, it is in Shelby, North Carolina, Cherryville actually, uh<n>, me and a buddy of mine from way back in elementary school, we were best friends back then, uh, I invited him over to my house and we were going to go out onto the lake.<n>I have a jet ski and he's got one too and, uh, so we, we went out there and started drinking a couple of beers.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
And, uh, at one point in time he actually runs into me on my jet ski and, uh, bends the handle bars and runs up on my legs and I got a big bruise on my legs, but I'm not feeling it then, I'm pretty well gone by this time.<n>And, uh, it's getting late in the afternoon and he says he has to get home, and he doesn't live on the lake so we load up his jet ski and, uh, put it on the trailer on the back of my truck and uh, we're going to go back to his house to take it back.<n>So, uh, we get it back on the trailer and we find out that, uh, we bent the handlebar on it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
I don't know if my mother ever finished it.<n>But one sticks out and it's still, um, at our home in New York and whenever I go back up there I always see the book lying around, um, in my room actually, or on the bookshelf.<n>And it's actually called the Trumpet of the Swan.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt
Uh, yeah actually.<n>I remember, my parents actually read to me, um, Watership Down, which is a story about a bunch of rabbits who, um, get driven out of wherever they're living, I forget the technical term for, for what their home under, under the ground is called, but they get driven out of that and they have to go and basically find a new place to live.<n>And I remember my parents read that to me.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt
Well, ah, I don't remember my parents reading anything I do remember being in grade school and being in the library and the librarian reading James and the Giant Peach to us.<n>And we would go to, I forget how often we'd go to library, like, you know, maybe it was once a week, maybe it was three times a week but everytime we'd go we'd all sit on the rug we'd sit Indian- style, cross-legged and, uh, I'm sure it's very politically incorrect at this point, but the librarian could never say that today.<n>Um, and then she would read us, you know, chapter at a time of James and the Giant Peach.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichDavid.txt
Hum.<n>In fact, I remember a few years ago they made a movie of it and I thought, "I ought to go see that," but I guess it didn't do so well and it fizzled and I never saw it, no.<n>Hum.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichDavid.txt
Hum.<n>Do ever go back and reread the things that you read when you were younger, now?<n>Uh--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichDavid.txt
I remember general things, I remember one time, we were at the shore, my fam, my grandfather had a house in Stone Harbor and there was a hurricane and I remember, um, you know, we moved all the furniture inside for the hurri, hurricane and we went out and he had an awning over his porch and, you know, and we, we double-tied the awning down.<n>During the hurricane we'd go out and check to make sure that uh, uh, you know, all the strings were still tied and the awning wasn't going to blow away, but I don't remember, you now, I don't think we'd sit around and telling that story I mean, I occasionally mention that.<n>"Do you remember?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichDavid.txt
Whenever.<n>This was not at Christmas, this was whenever we would go over and visit, visit her.<n>She always made me sit down and read this<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichMegan.txt
I don't know.<n>She did this every time you'd go over there like on a regular basis?<n>Yeah!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichMegan.txt
It seemed like it.<n>This was before, this was when my grandfather and her weren't married so we would go over and read it with me I was not even sure what was going on, but um,<n>, but I just remember having to read that and that was it um, with her.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichMegan.txt
I remember, yeah I remember that based on later conversations that I ( ) with him about it, but at the time I guess I really wasn't sure what it was about, but I knew<n>that when it all came down to the bottom of it, I knew that what I had done was the wrong thing to do and he told me that I'm going to probably have to go down there and help Mrs. Faulk pick up the tomatoes when it's all said and done, and I remember being a little bit nervous about that.<n>I didn't really know Mrs. Faulk very well she was about 80 and, ah, she was a nice person I had seen her a few times but I was really nervous about that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
We were watching something on TV.<n>I can't remember what it was but I suddenly got really nervous that I was about to go to school for the first time and that was probably the most stressful day of my life.<n>I had forgotten that I was moving to a new place and I had forgotten that I was, uh, going to be going to school.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
I think that's why I remember that.<n>Um, when I was young we used to go on a lot of yearly vacations.<n>Every year we'd go from, whether it be MO to IL or IO to IL or KS to IL, the whole time I was growing up because in IL that's where my grandparents lived and every year we'd go up there and spend about a week with them in the summer, and we'd also go down there for Christmas too, but mostly I remember going down there every year, um, for the summer and it was, ah, a lot of arguing in the car, and I remember sitting next to my, uh, I had two sisters, so the middle one was always in the middle, for some reason.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
Um, when I was young we used to go on a lot of yearly vacations.<n>Every year we'd go from, whether it be MO to IL or IO to IL or KS to IL, the whole time I was growing up because in IL that's where my grandparents lived and every year we'd go up there and spend about a week with them in the summer, and we'd also go down there for Christmas too, but mostly I remember going down there every year, um, for the summer and it was, ah, a lot of arguing in the car, and I remember sitting next to my, uh, I had two sisters, so the middle one was always in the middle, for some reason.<n>She was, she was, uh, the middle one's always in the middle.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
Was, she would eat peanut butter cups, and she knows that I hate the smell of peanut butter, so she would actually eat the peanut butter cup and then breathe in my face and there wasn't really any way for me to defend against that because I couldn't think of any food that she really thought stunk and you know it was like it was it was untouchable there wasn't anything I could do about that, so I would, I would get really mad at that and I'd say, "Mom, Mom," and she would say, you know, "She's just breathing," so there was really no way out of it, so I remember a lot of that.<n>So when I was in, when I was at grandma and grandpa's house, we used to have a great time just fishing and hanging out with grandpa, and my cousins would go there and every Fourth of July we'd do fireworks.<n>Um, it was on the river and it was, ah, it was very peaceful.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
He acted like, he needed it soon, but the way she had everything done, I would have had to, I would have had to start from the very beginning, and most of it was just like data entry to start off with.<n>And then once you get everything entered you can go on from there.<n>Well, the rest of the day I was just entering, entering, entering, entering information.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
Well, the rest of the day I was just entering, entering, entering, entering information.<n>It wasn't until like before 5:00 that I had finished entering something and I was able to look and see, "OK where do I go from here now that I have this done, where do these totals go to, on another sheet?"<n>So I'm like, "OK he hasn't called back or anything," so I'm figuring I can do it on Monday.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
I don't have enough information.<n>So, I go in there, and I haven't even told him yet that I had to start from the very beginning, because I was like, I didn't want to tell him!<n>So and let me tell you I got to the point today where I was about to quit.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
And I was like, "I'm almost done."<n>He was like, "All right, well I'm going go out and run some errands, and um, just put it up on my shelf, and um, if I have any review notes I'll give them to you in the morning.<n>And I was like "OK," and that was it!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
Is it like that all the time?<n>Yep whenever he there, um, which he's not there he's there most of the time but he is gone a lot but whenever he is there, and especially if he gives you something to do it's like you don't even want it because you know it's going to be that way and it's like other people hesitate to come through because they don't want to have said something wrong and then you go back to him well like, you know, such and such helped me and it's not like you're ratting anybody out you're just saying you know such and such helped me and that's how I got to this number but it's like people are hesitating basically and it's really frustrating.<n>So what is it that they wanted you to do?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
And, uh, so uh, Granny grew up, she was like-- I think she told me this was when she was about 10 years old when this happened and her brother Joe was like 16 and, uh, so she grew up and, uh, she uh, got married, and uh, that's another story.<n>She got married when she was 16 to my grandfather, who was 30, and she didn't know she had to go live with him, but anyway that's another story<n>about ignorance, among people, but anyway they were sitting on the porch and she was back visiting uh, her mother, and they were sitting on the porch and it was like this long road, it was like the house was like situated at the end of this long road and you could see all the way down the road a, a long way.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt
That they shouldn't do that, that you should accept your lot in life, although you should work to improve it, you know, you should be who you are and not try to be something else.<n>Um, but she used to visit her sister, ah, in, in, in Augusta, and, but she used to have to go in the back door and pretend she was the maid.<n>Granny hated that!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt
Wow!<n>And so when they told her she had to go home with this guy, she said, "Go home with him?<n>He's old enough to be my daddy."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt
.<n>And the problem was that animals didn't like to stay at the house they wanted to go around to other people's houses, you know, eat their flowers and stuff and plants.<n>We lived off, um, 85 in Mallard Creek where currently the 485 is now cause then the like last ten years we had to move because of the 485.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FosterDimitra.txt
They didn't want to stay captive.<n>They would go, you know, just go out of the fence.<n>A lot of times they would get their horns and stuff caught into the, um, fences because there were square fences that my father himself put up all around the property but they would get their horns and stuff, and they would jump over the fence very easily so they would be on the side of the highway and at least 4 or 5 times that I can remember the police would have to come and say, you know, "You have to get your animals."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FosterDimitra.txt
, and I thought this was really crazy because who else in the neighborhood had goats and chickens and stuff and so but he was convinced that they could not prove that those were our goats so but it was very embarrassing as a child living in Mallard Creek because people, everybody knew when you rode a school bus, um, we didn't have the yard with the flowers and stuff.<n>We had the goats out there and often our animals would get loose and we had to go out and follow our cow home or something like that, or the, um, animal control would come out to like subdue a cow if it would get too far away so that's really the story I have today, um<n>it was just really a awkward experience with him and his animals.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FosterDimitra.txt
and it was really horrible for us as children it was traumatizing.<n>To see your little pet or friend, you know, have to be killed, skinned, and then they would cut it up and put out their parts there and then they would go off to their restaurant, to their dinner or wedding, or whatever, and eat the goat.<n>So that's about it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FosterDimitra.txt
That's kind of unique in that I, uh, spent, uh, about 16 years of my career in Special Activities.<n>I don't want to go into the Third SS that's Third Strategic Support Squadron.<n>Way back in, uh, 19 and 60, 19 and 52, when I returned from the, uh, Korea, I was assigned to, uh, a unit, which was called C124 Third Strategic Support Squadron, and, uh, one of their primary purposes was to, uh, uh, move atomic weapons to forward locations.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
If you started to run it back to the elevator, why it would turn the aircraft upside down, so it would if we had trouble the, the bomb itself would end with the aircraft, of course.<n>The rest of us after, uh, after we got the trigger out, why we, uh, would bale out of the aircraft, regardless whether if it was water, over land, air or what, but the bottom did go in.<n>I want to say that there wasn't any danger of going in with the bomb because it would not explode, regardless of how hard it hit the ground.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
But anyway, uh,<n>I had a top secret clearance in that, so in 19 and 57 why, uh, they started, uh, I didn't know why they was a running the clearance on me to begin because I thought uh, top secret was the highest you could go in security clearance, and, of course, that I knew, everybody in my neighborhood was asking me, "Well what if they're asking about you?"<n>And even uh, uh, a neighbor in Earl, NC told me that they was a checking with him on why, uh, uh, on why, uh, they was running a clearance on me.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
I didn't know anything about it until about the time, well, uh, I knew about it when they was running the clearance on me when I had a top secret, so I didn't know anything about what it was all about until I arrived.<n>I got orders to go to Del Rio, TX, so when I arrived out there, well, I found out I had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base.<n>I was reporting to a certain place in Del Rio, then I had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base, which had just re-opened.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
I got orders to go to Del Rio, TX, so when I arrived out there, well, I found out I had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base.<n>I was reporting to a certain place in Del Rio, then I had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base, which had just re-opened.<n>It wasn't nothing but a desert; there was sagebrush out on the runway.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
I had already been to partial pressure suit school in my career field, where I was ( ), so I started training with equipment I had never handled before.<n>I didn't know what it was all about or anything till I had to go out and train hook in a ( ) in a RV57D, which I say now I found it, it was a forerunner to your U2 aircraft.<n>But at the time I arrived there, we didn't have any U2's.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Well it got to where there's two or three aircraft arrive in a week and I didn't know where they're flying to.<n>All we done, they never did tell us any place where they was going, even when they left the base to go to somewhere else to stay for a while.<n>We didn't know where they were going.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
You know, you can't, you cannot survive if you don't have any counter pressure, increase breathing pressure in those altitudes.<n>If, if your hand was exposed outside of the pressure suit, your hands would go to about five times the size, if you had a decompression.<n>Well of, of course, needless to say, we had a, we could not make a mistake.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Physiological support differs from life support in that he handles the altitude chambers which run pilots up to 80 thousand feet in high altitude chambers, and brings him back down.<n>They have to go through a number of altitude chambers, uh, rides before they start even flying U2's or flying with pressure suits.<n>Of course they already had done the pilot's bit before they done, well, I had to go through altitude chambers myself because I was working with pressure suits.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
They have to go through a number of altitude chambers, uh, rides before they start even flying U2's or flying with pressure suits.<n>Of course they already had done the pilot's bit before they done, well, I had to go through altitude chambers myself because I was working with pressure suits.<n>I went to Fort Worth, TX to go through the altitude chambers with a partial pressure just like I was working with, and when, when all the training was done on the pressure suits and things, I was chosen with a sergeant secretary to go through a school, which, we was in a school about the size of a nice-size bathroom.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Of course they already had done the pilot's bit before they done, well, I had to go through altitude chambers myself because I was working with pressure suits.<n>I went to Fort Worth, TX to go through the altitude chambers with a partial pressure just like I was working with, and when, when all the training was done on the pressure suits and things, I was chosen with a sergeant secretary to go through a school, which, we was in a school about the size of a nice-size bathroom.<n>We would go in there.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
I went to Fort Worth, TX to go through the altitude chambers with a partial pressure just like I was working with, and when, when all the training was done on the pressure suits and things, I was chosen with a sergeant secretary to go through a school, which, we was in a school about the size of a nice-size bathroom.<n>We would go in there.<n>The doors were locked when we went in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Then he'd dress me, and, uh, he'd set the injection on me and you, uh, uh, we'd have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then we'd come up breathing as hard as we could, and you better if uh, the, the, the top portion of your helmet surged, which you had rubber around the neck and the visor closed.<n>And, uh, if it surged and just kept surging it would go 'whish,' and, like it was going to pull your head off.<n>You'd better get the little screw turned down a little bit because you could damage and individual's lungs very easily.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
I would think, "Well, I'm, I'm going to let somebody else go," but then I would think, "My God!<n>They've, they chosen me over about 15 individuals there, to go to through that school and I'm not, I'm not.<n>So I would go back determined, determined to stay with it, and, of course, they trained two more after I had been through, but who did they use to set all the injections?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
They've, they chosen me over about 15 individuals there, to go to through that school and I'm not, I'm not.<n>So I would go back determined, determined to stay with it, and, of course, they trained two more after I had been through, but who did they use to set all the injections?<n>And it was myself and Secretary, the one who went through that school, that, you know, the two that we went.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
And so, well, anyway, uh, they chose me.<n>Also, oh, let me go through this.<n>About, uh, less than two months after uh, uh, we finished the school and was set the injections on pilots for about two months, Firewell and Company come up with an automatic, fool-proof uh, uh, that uh, the regulator adjusted itself with a little valve that moved back and forth.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
OK, well, that's where I went.<n>They chose me over everybody else, and, of course Sergeant Secretary, he was a different AFC, but he's the one that went through school with, they chose me to go out of the uh, uh, the organization that I was at on the present.<n>Now it's on the same base, but they've set, taken me to field maintenance to run regulators in the ( ) altitude chambers.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
That still stands today.<n>Uh, of course, I won't go but we, I have just so much I could talk about, but, uh, that is the main things that we, of course, everybody knows now that the, what has happened.<n>Uh, Russia backed down and that's the good thing to do because if they did not and we went to nuclear war, I was trying to get my family out of Del Rio and back to NC, but it happened so fast I didn't get them back.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
This was the first time that, that had happened in 75 years, that TX legislature had voted a military unit being TX Ambassadors, so, needed TX Ambassadors.<n>Late 1962, uh, I got orders to go to Washington, D.C. I didn't know what I was going for or anything, so was to report to a designated place in Washington.<n>Uh, I went ahead up and it was highly classified, even my orders were classified.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Uh, I went ahead up and it was highly classified, even my orders were classified.<n>So I went to, I went to Washington D.C. and I didn't go directly to, uh, that, uh, they had told me to on my orders.<n>I went to my sister's that lived there .<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
They asked a few questions and I answered them and they said, "Get your baggage and leave there immediately, and come to the address you were supposed to when you arrived in Washington."<n>I go ahead and picked the baggage and went to the address I was supposed to.<n>Of course, they questioned me there, why I went.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Well after they checked, they asked me about her husband.<n>After they checked, found out he was in security service with the Air Force, they said, "OK," I could go ahead back and stay there if I wanted and they gave me a certain time to report to the CIA Headquarters, which I can say that name, and needless to say, I was up there for a week and I, I can't say anything else what happened or anything.<n>But I didn't know what in God's world I was there for.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
They told me that, uh, that I would be called in a guy at the end for me to meet.<n>It was another GI and said I would go with him on Monday morning to a certain location, and we never was for many, many years, we could not even mention the location, but now I have the declassification of it, Roadrunner's International right there in it's authorized, and it tells all about the A-12 Blackbird crew that I was going to in early 1963 and I guess it was the most classified thing that there was at that time in the United States but when I got out and gone out found out what was going into and I looked at one of those birds, there was actually bile come into my mouth.<n>Now that's how, uh, I stay buckled in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
I started immediately, uh, uh, training into that from the other two guys that was at the location.<n>They had already had their training in the full pressure suits and it taken me a while if you go into full pressure suits.<n>Different, totally different types parachutes and in an bird that flies, uh, three times the speed of sound, over 22,000 miles an hour.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Different, totally different types parachutes and in an bird that flies, uh, three times the speed of sound, over 22,000 miles an hour.<n>You can't even imagine that and I really can't get over, as, as many pilots that I put in that aircraft, and know, and seen them come in ( ) and go walk up the plank to, to get him out of the aircraft and he waits for me to get him out.<n>And then he looks.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
I stayed with them until 19 and 69 before I left there.<n>And uh, course I won't go into anything else because I'm not prepared with my information here, but thank you very much.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Well, Alex, the youngest, of course he's just so sick of being in this truck, he says, "Get me out of here," you know, just, "Let me out!"<n>I say, "OK, everybody, we're going to get out of the truck, we're going to kind of look around, we'll do some stuff, and then, we'll probably eat breakfast, and then we'll go or, ea, we had our little bag lunches, and then we'll go down to the lake.<n>And, uh, we get out of the truck, and we walk about ten feet, and I, I was like, walking over logs and trying to get over to a fairly clear area, and all of a sudden, Alex just goes, "Snake!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt
And I, I'm like, God, somebody's trying to tell me something.<n>So anyway, we kind of, we stayed away from the snake and we're kind of walking around, and then, Jack and Nick, they, Jack's the oldest, and Nick, you know, is eight, and, uh, they want to go down to the lake, and Elizabeth's going, "No, don't let them go down to the lake, just, it's too steep, don't let them go down to the lake."<n>And, uh,<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt
we, you know, they're just saying, "Well what are we doing?<n>We're just going to get in the truck and then go back?<n>Let's just at least look at the lake."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt
So I said, "OK, guys.<n>You guys can go, go down to the lake, just be careful."<n>And, uh, so they kind of walked over to the hill, kind of started walking down, and at a point they just had to sit on their butts and kind of slide down, and the trees were all cut, so they'd grab trees as they were going down.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt
And, uh, so they kind of walked over to the hill, kind of started walking down, and at a point they just had to sit on their butts and kind of slide down, and the trees were all cut, so they'd grab trees as they were going down.<n>And, um, I was just watching them, and I was up at the top, and then, I started down, I'd figured, let them go first, then I'd, I'd go kind of behind them.<n>I was probably, um, I'd say sixty foot behind them.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt
So I looked really weird.<n>So I go into the doctor's office, you know, back in high school days I thought it was cool I had the black leather jacket and all that.<n>The long hair.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GavinJeff.txt
You were passed out half the time.<n>Right, they had to go through wondering for three days whether or not I was going to live.<n>For a couple of days maybe not three days for like a, I guess, maybe like a 24-hour period or what ever.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GavinJeff.txt
But this is meter parking and, I mean, if you went a minute over you had a ticket.<n>You mean there was someone there waiting for it to go a minute over.<n>Yeah it was like magic.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GavinJeff.txt

So her pacifier would fall out of her mouth at night so she would just wake up.<n>It would be right next to her she wouldn't just grab it a stick it in her mouth she would go "Mimi, Mimi."<n>So I had to get up a put the pacifier in her mouth it was really cute.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GavinJeff.txt
So I had to get up a put the pacifier in her mouth it was really cute.<n>Just so she would go back to sleep.<n>That is really funny.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GavinJeff.txt

Her parents were renting a place and she and I and another one of our girlfriends went.<n>And we would go up and down the main drag there at Myrtle Beach where the Pavilion is and we would thumb up and down the, and we would just hop in the car with guys and ride up and down and yell and wave to everybody and then we'd get tired of those guys and we'd hop and go hop out and hop in the car with some more guys.<n>It was totally safe!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt
He got it from somebody and called me.<n>And I wasn't really dating that guy that seriously, so I decided to go out with Steve.<n>So I went out with him.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt
Yeah.<n>There were no, there were only two night clubs in Charlotte so if you wanted to go out, like to listen to music and dance, there was only two places to go.<n>So most everything, the apartment complexes would have parties.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt

And they had the, the Shoney's Big Boy was always sitting out front.<n>And that was the big thing for all the guys, was to steal the Shoney's Big Boy and try to get it on top of their car and go riding down the road with it on top of the car.<n>Um, once when I was in high school, I spent the night with my girlfriend across the street and we snuck out and pushed her mother's brand new Camero out of the driveway and halfway down the road then we started it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt
And I spent a lot of summers, I spent like a whole month in the summer there with them.<n>We, this was at the beach, and we'd go to the beach during the day and the movies or stuff at night.<n>The family would come up here.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt
He had a gun shop, he tried several different stores, and he had a gun shop.<n>He had that on the porch of the house and I used to sit out there and help him load shotgun shells and we used to go target shooting and stuff.<n>Um, so we just didn't have much money.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt
So that all I could afford to do was get the shoes and the sweaters and I made all my skirts and made my blouses.<n>And the first time I ever, we, we camped, we would go to the mountains and go camping that was the only thing we did as far as a vacation.<n>Never flew; I was 21 years old before I'd ever flown on a airplane.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt
So when she got home I was responsible for doing the cooking and having all that done when she got home from work.<n>We just didn't, the big thing was to go to a place called Dino's Pizzas and get pizza.<n>Um, is that 5 minutes?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt
He talks about being in the Depression and they were very poor, and they had to get coal.<n>They had to uh, heat their house and there was a place where the trains had to slow down on this hill as they climbed with, with coal going to New York City and the kids would get on this train with big sacks, big heavy sacks called burlap sacks and they would steal coal from the train, put it in these big bags, throw the bags off jump off before the train got rolling fast again to go down the hill.<n>And that's how they kept warm in the winter, and the winters were very severe.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoedekeThomas.txt
It made a huge impression on me and was a big thing.<n>Columbus, GA is the home of Fort Benning, GA, where the largest infantry school in the world at that time was there, and as a kid walking to school, and believe it or not, I did walk four or five miles to school and I would go up Brown Avenue, which was at that time the only road that would allow the convoys to come through.<n>And I would walk along the road to school and convoys of young men would, uh, ride by in the backs of trucks and I would wave at them and it was not a sexual thing in those days.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
And they said, "Well, we don't care we don't mind that.<n>We'll just bring us some cots from the Army and we'll go to the, uh, service station," which was several blocks away.<n>There was not an open place, a service station one very corner in those days.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
And we just became very, very close friends and loved them dearly.<n>And, uh, he did go off to war and did come back and many years after that nearly every year they would come down to see us in Columbus from Erie.<n>In fact, when he came back, one time he gave me a beautiful large pearl, perfect pearl and years and years later, when my father died in 1978, I had, took some of the money that I got from his inheritance and, uh, bought a heart and placed that pearl in the center of the heart and now wear it; one of my treasured possessions.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
That's just kind of a little aside from the war days.<n>But I can remember at that time that we'd go out to have uh we played softball and I happened to be, when I was 12 years old I was a freshman in high school.<n>In fact, uh, I had skipped a grade in grammar school is why I was so young to go off to high school.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
But I can remember at that time that we'd go out to have uh we played softball and I happened to be, when I was 12 years old I was a freshman in high school.<n>In fact, uh, I had skipped a grade in grammar school is why I was so young to go off to high school.<n>When all my grandchildren ask me, uh tell me how smart I was to skip a grade.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
There was someone in the car with him and I don't remember anything about that.<n>But I do remember that we stood and watched him go by and waved at him.<n>I don't remember whether he waved back or not so I did get to see President Roosevelt himself and in person so that was a big thrill for me as a young person.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
Another experience that I remember very clearly was riding on the train from, we were going down to see my grandparents at Bradenton, Palmetto, FL actually below Tampa.<n>And we would go down there and spend about a month or six weeks every summer on a train and we had to change trains in Jacksonville, FL.<n>Dad would drive me to Albany, drive us to Albany, GA to catch the train and it would be full of enlisted men heading off to the war.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
I had a small child had a two and-a-half year old and a baby.<n>And I can remember that I had one of the first boxes of disposal diapers and I stood up in the train in the center of the train to go to the restroom and take Donna and change her diaper and she went to the bathroom and it all came down my dress and down her leg and puddled on the floor.<n>And so much for disposable diapers.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
to watch the meteor shower.<n>It's going to be an adventure and then we'll go to McDonald's for breakfast.<n>That's good.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
I had previously broke the window by throwing a baseball through it on, by accident.<n>Well, we was replacing this window, and we got it fixed, and my dad was like, "Let's go for a little bike ride."<n>It was probably about 5:30 in the evening, you know, right before mom had supper ready, so we went for a quick bike ride.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt
And he said a few words, and he didn't want to move me because he, he saw the way I fell and thought maybe I'd broke some ribs or something and he didn't want to move me.<n>So I am laying here in the middle of the road, and he kept asking if I am all right and I was like, "Yeah I'm all right," because I knew something was wrong with me, and I hate hospitals and, and I don't want to go to a hospital if something happens to me.<n>But uh, I was like, "I'm all right."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt
and I was like, "Yeah I'm OK Mom.<n>I don't need to go to the hospital or anything like that, I am fine."<n>And she goes, "OK open your mouth for me."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt
So I opened my mouth, and I couldn't get it, I couldn't shut it back.<n>You had to go to the hospital like that<n>?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt
Yeah.<n>She was like, she was like, "OK you got to go to the hospital."<n>So I started going nuts<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt
Did they put you to sleep?<n>Nah, well like that night they told me they'd let me go home and stuff from the hospital, and my, I mean my, before I went to bed my dad was like, "Well you got to go see a specialist tomorrow," and I was like "Wh, what's he going to do?"<n>and he was like, "Well he'll just tell you you're going to have to, you know, eat mashed potatoes and stuff the whole time, soup and that's it," and I was like, "OK."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt
Well, that night I couldn't sleep at all because it felt like a brick wall, a brick, I mean a brick wall was on my head, so much pressure was on my chin and stuff, my jaw.<n>So the next morning we go and it was Doctor Trevez I believe.<n>That's who did my um,<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt
Uh-huh.<n>So uh, I had to go through that in high school.<n>And you know, people started doing the "Kevin Talk."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt
That's right.<n>How did you go about doing that?<n>Oh we had assignments where, um, we had to, um, write out the definition, actually write out, you know, using the word in a sentence.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
Well, not really, not as unusual as you might think.<n>But, um, when we moved to VA, and I started to go to school here, um, the rejection I got was because I was a Northerner, and, uh, well, not here because I am in Charlotte now, but there.<n>Um-hum.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
Umm, high school was when I would write it down and keep it!<n>I mean I have things now that I can go back to, uh, poems that I wrote in high school, but I was writing before that, I just, you know how things just disappear?<n>Yes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
And, I really appreciated the original stories from this perspective.<n>He captured personalities in a way that, um, I still go back to th, those, uh, Pooh and Eeyore.<n>When I'm, my husband and I talk personality a lot and, you know, what personality type is a particular person and we really found it to be very helpful in understanding them and we realize that no one is one personality type; we're all conglomerates.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
At, at that point in time I wasn't even thinking in the personality realm, and I hadn't drawn any connection to it.<n>Um, it was, it was, just, um, more of my, you know, how the teenagers go through, uh, "Trying to find myself", a questioning period?<n>And that was one of the poems that came out of my, "Who Am I?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
And one of the things that I have found, whether it's in a movie or a book, it's got to engage me psychologically on some level.<n>I mean, I don't really go for, for "fluff" very much.<n>I<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
So, you don't mind re-reading?<n>Oh, no, especially, that's how I know what my favorite books are because they are books I go back to.<n>Go back to--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
Now I'm the kind of person, I'm very sequential, I've got to know what the end is!<n>I go to the back of the book<n>to find out how it ended.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
Um-hum.<n>They go too many different places without bringing some level of resolution to whatever the, uh, issue is that they're dealing with, you know.<n>Jumping around with three different kinds of story lines, that does not appeal to me<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
at all!<n>Are you in the habit then, since you go to the back of the book for the mysteries, are you having to do that with the other readings?<n>Um, sometimes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
There's something, well not only that aspect of the way that the writer, he writes, he basically gives two different endings to the story.<n>You know, you could stop at the answer that satisfies and think that that's the end of the story, but then you go to the next chapter and it's like, "Ah ha!"<n>Um-hum.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
And, um, all of her children are, are readers.<n>And, um, she definitely believed that education was a essential and, "You will go to college!"<n>So that was something that was definitely handed down.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
And I um, try to keep my piles under control.<n>And periodically I have to go through and I will go to like, the library book sales and I'll choose to take what piles, either the author or the title, that will interest me.<n>It's only a quarter so you support the library and you buy a book and--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
And the depiction, the, the, the story that she depicts, um, is so, to me, has so many aspects of a true, the struggles of our lives, that every time I read it, because I'm a little different, I get something a little different from it.<n>And that's one that I give it away, and then have to go get another copy!<n>Because I always want that in my library.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
Because I always want that in my library.<n>I always want to be able to go back and read it again.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
Um-hum.<n>I got permission to have homeroom in the library and I then I would go there for my lunch and, I mean, I would take me like,<n>that long to eat my food and I would go, "I have permission to go up to the library."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
I got permission to have homeroom in the library and I then I would go there for my lunch and, I mean, I would take me like,<n>that long to eat my food and I would go, "I have permission to go up to the library."<n>Umm.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
And so, um, I found it kind of like being the librarian helper because I was there all the time.<n>And, uh, I, as a matter of fact at one point I was going to go into Library Science.<n>I was just about to ask you!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
Um-hum.<n>And I'm, I'm now with Ron's collection and mine, I'm starting to go into his area and pulling off the shelves, books that he's collected and going to read those.<n>Ooh!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
And the two grandmothers had nothing in common but each one really gave me quite a gift.<n>Grandmother Tina had traveled, uh, as the wife of a military man herself and had a real interest in adventure in other cultures, uh, the out-of-doors and I remember when I was five or six she would take me by the hand and say, "Where would you like to go for a walk?"<n>and I'd point and we'd go, off in that direction--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
She'd still want to garden and things would be coming up and she would think it was time to pull them out.<n>You'd have to kind of go behind her and say, "Whoa"<n>.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
Well, my grandmother Tina, who was a little girl, got sick with some fever, and her mother was staying up with her night and day and was just exhausted.<n>And the Indians, some of the Indians knew about it, and they said, they said to Tina's mother, "You go get some sleep.<n>We'll take care of your little girl."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
OK.<n>All right, go ahead.<n>Tell us about Disney World.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt
you did the rest of the time you were at Disney World.<n>So you rode the merry-go-round and we'd go back and meet you every once in a while and you were having a great time.<n>We didn't care, and the merry-go-round was, uh, was as good as it got for you.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt
.<n>Uh, so then we, then you go through all these passage ways and you come into this, um, this long stretch where all of a sudden it's this like this big long cave and it's all, there's stuff all around the walls and there are, uh, and there are all these little tiny action figures little dolls and so on jumping up and making faces and all that kind of stuff, and singing and the music is, uh<n>.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt
Cattaraugus County, which is the next county down from Erie County, which is where Buffalo is.<n>And so, that was the place where Andy and Mom and Saul, the guys and I would all go in high school on weekends and usually we would just go to, uh, to walk along the path because it's a huge, uh, it's got Cattaraugus County Creek down at the bottom of it, it's got great big shale cliffs with lots of really loose shale on it and usually we'd walk along the stream bank and go swimming and jump off cliffs, that sort of thing.<n>But once we decided to climb it, it didn't look too tough to climb up, so we thought, "What the heck, let's give it a shot."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt
We both like skiing and went skiing, "Let's ski this stuff," and in a little while we went, "Yeah, you can probably see what's coming here."<n>Uh, I didn't go over the edge by the way.<n>So we both started skiing, and we're pretty good skiers.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt
We were jumping up and down and pretending we were parallel skiing back and forth and leaping up in the air in big clouds of dust, and it was really fun, and Andy finally quit.<n>He got tired and I thought I'd go a little farther and I skied a few more steps and somehow one of us had dislodged a fairly good size rock, which I had no idea was bouncing down the hill toward me.<n>And I'm skiing away having a great time and once when I came up, I remember, I can still remember I came up in mid air and I was as high up off the shale as you could get making my next turn, and "Wham!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt
She got married and she married this, uh, very predominant guy who's very, very well-off and they moved back to their, her hometown in GA.<n>So she decided that she would go and visit her grandmother who raised her, and her grandmother was telling how she told her it would be hard and for her to make it once she let it known that she was an African, Afro-American.<n>So she decided that she would start an organization, and I can't remember the name of it, to where, it has something to do with women's, um, Women's Black American, Women's something and, to, she, um, let me see what else.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HicksDebra.txt
And it was so miserable and the house was so crowded and the kids were so wild that by Sunday by that Christmas afternoon they had taken everything down and boxed everything back up again just to get it out of the way just because they, uh, were so miserable that Christmas because my brother had been so sick.<n>Um, another time, this was for the, um, other brother, um, the one that had been sick as a baby, they bought him, one year, all this um cowboy and Indian stuff, and again all this assembly was required, and, um, the same friends that had helped put together all the boxes a few years earlier for my other brother, um, had come over and they had to put all these decals and stickers on everything and then had to individually dress all the different Indians, and, um cowboys and you know the tiny guns and the little itty-bitty tiny holsters that they had to put around the waist of all the different cowboys, and, uh, then, you know, all the little, um, suits and headdresses and everything that had to go on all the little Indians and the horses and the saddles and all this kind of stuff.<n>And Dad said they were up till like four o'clock in the morning getting all this stuff put together and were just exhausted and about dead.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt

Um, and, um, I remember another time, um, being told about a time when the family was up in the mountains.<n>We had this place that we would go to and they called it our rock.<n>But it was near, um, on the way to Chimney Rock, I think, and it was just off the side of the road and, and where the river was and there was a great big old flat rock that sort of jutted out into the river and, um, we would go up there, you know, occasionally on the weekends and have like a picnic and stuff on the rock.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt

before I would go anywhere with my dad again ever.<n>I mean I was just convinced he was going to lose me and every time he would ask me to go somewhere I would be like, "No you're going to lose me again," and, you know, it was just the longest time before I ever trusted him enough to even go anywhere with him.<n>Um, and, I think that's most of like the little funny stories that I can remember.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt
And, and how about living in the South?<n>Do you think that's actually, ah, I mean when, if when, you go back up North do people say, "Hey I can tell you're picking up some `y'alls' or something."<n>I have not heard that to the to the best of my knowledge I have never knowingly used the term "y'all."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt
In fact my aunt who just died within the last month was living in the house that my grandmother and grandfather built when they first moved to Guelph very old wood-framed house on two lots and at the time this wasn't a big deal but now it is, there's about a hundred yards of, a hundred yard wide strip of forest behind the house and then behind that is a private country club, and a very nice one and so the land the land has become very valuable.<n>At the time obviously it wasn't a big deal to live on a golf course and now it is, so that, that property is still in the family, um, as a kid my I used to go, we used to go up there every year for family reunions we would ah drive from Chicago through Detroit up to Guelph.<n>To the same house?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt
Right.<n>So it's, um, almost like you'll, you'll meet, ah, if you go to Guelph you'll meet someone will probably know a Jamieson there.<n>Yeah, yeah because some of, like my aunt who just died was a bookkeeper who worked at a lot of local businesses and was extremely gregarious, so I think she was probably on a first name basis with a awful lot of the people who shopped downtown or whoever went downtown she was she lived there all her life and just knew a lot of people and they sort of come out of that kind of, that Irish tradition like everybody's your friend, everybody's your neighbor and even people that, ah should be fairly casually, she'd greet those people by name and know a little bit about them, ah, and so yeah she's, ah, and my cousin, one of my cousins, has a couple of businesses in town and I think is relatively well-known is on some sort of city board, or something like that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt
Uh-huh.<n>And then, ah, I guess the family reunion is, when is the next one you're going to go to?<n>It's August 12th of this year, August 12th of 2000, and, uh, don't know, don't know too many more details about it and don't know if I'll be able to go.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt
.<n>We decided to go to Myrtle Beach, SC.<n>We left early on a Thursday morning around 10:00.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt
.<n>After we sat on the beach, we decided that we should get ready to go out to dinner<n>.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt
.<n>After we got ready to go about to dinner, we drove around looking for a restaurant.<n>We finally found an all you can eat seafood buffet.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt
.<n>After we ate dinner we decided to go and play some games in the arcade.<n>The kids went bowling, shot basketball, and just ran around crazy.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt
The kids went bowling, shot basketball, and just ran around crazy.<n>It was getting late, but we decided that we should go on the bumper cars.<n>The bumper cars were a blast.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt
.<n>By then we decided we should go back to the room.<n>It wasn't that late, it was only about nine o'clock, so we decided to get some flashlights and go for a walk on the beach.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt
By then we decided we should go back to the room.<n>It wasn't that late, it was only about nine o'clock, so we decided to get some flashlights and go for a walk on the beach.<n>We went out on the beach and started to hunt for little sand crabs.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt
.<n>The next day we got up around nine o'clock and decided to go sit out and play on the beach.<n>The kids built sandcastles, and played in the waves and laid out in the sun.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt
By then it was time for lunch.<n>We decided just to go down to a hotdog stand and get some hotdogs to eat.<n>And to chill off in the shade since to was getting kind of hot.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt
They were all so pretty, it was so much fun.<n>Well, it was getting late so I think it is time to go home.<n>So, we went back to the room and we all fell asleep.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt
Well, I worked as a police officer for the town of Matthews for about four and a half years until recently.<n>And I'll tell the story of one of my chases and if that doesn't go enough time I'll tell the story of another chase, vehicle chase.<n>Um,<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt
And so I went ahead and let my units know up ahead as soon as we got into Matthews, he's getting blue lighted.<n>And I felt that he was impaired to go ahead and start another unit then.<n>And so we're running 70, probably 70, a good 70 miles an hour and we go, we pass over Sardis North and right as we get into Matthews about where, uh, Crown Point Executive Dr is, I, uh, told them I was initiating a stop.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt
I don't feel comfortable anymore.<n>I'm going to go ahead and 22 the chase."<n>10-22 is `Disregard the Chase,' you know, go ahead and, and let back.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt
I'm going to go ahead and 22 the chase."<n>10-22 is `Disregard the Chase,' you know, go ahead and, and let back.<n>I had already called 10-43, which is `Pursuit.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt
And so as I'm backing off, I'm, I'm still keeping an eye on him if he's slowing down a little bit and he goes to highway, to Matthews-Mint Hill and 74 makes a left hand turn.<n>And so I went ahead and, uh, got back in the chase again because I figured, um, you know, I just figured I'd go ahead, go ahead and chase him because I knew that he couldn't keep up that kind of speed on the, uh, on the Matthews-Mint Hill.<n>And Rich was in behind me by then and so we head on the way down Matthews-Mint Hill, we probably running around 80 or 90 miles an hour.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt
When I was three years old my family and I moved to Myrtle Beach, SC from Woonsocket, RI, and when I was younger, I guess about seven, eight, nine years old, every Christmas my family and I would go to visit our relatives in Woonsocket, and we usually left on the 22nd of December, and I remember it being a really long car ride 16 hours and my sister, my younger sister, who was four years younger than me, would often fight in the back seat, and when we got there, um, we would stay in a hotel called the Suisse Chalet, and it was in Smits, Smithfield, RI, which was about 20 minutes away from Woonsocket where my relatives were from, and in Woonsocket we would visit both my sets of grandparents, who lived there, and it's tradition in my family that on Christmas Eve we would eat dinner at, um, my grandparents house on my mom's side and my grandmother would cook a huge dinner Christmas dinner and Christmas Eve dinner, and we would open one of our Christmas presents, which I thought was a great<n>tradition, and it's a tradition that we still practice to this day, and usually on New Year's Day my mother's family had a tradition of renting a hall or a restaurant bar that was sort of a reunion, um, so that we could see all of our relatives, and I remember spending time with my cousins who, Stacy and Stephanie, who were about my age.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt
tradition, and it's a tradition that we still practice to this day, and usually on New Year's Day my mother's family had a tradition of renting a hall or a restaurant bar that was sort of a reunion, um, so that we could see all of our relatives, and I remember spending time with my cousins who, Stacy and Stephanie, who were about my age.<n>Um, at the time, when I was a sophomore in college at Notre Dame I decided to go on Spring Break, which happened around late March, and I decided to go to Boca Raton, FL with my best friend from high school.<n>Her name was Crystal.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt
Her name was Crystal.<n>And so, um, we met in FL, and in Boca Raton and we stayed with my grandparents, and we would stay with my grandparents for at least one night, uh Boca Raton, and then the rest of the week we spent in Fort Lauderdale because my grandfather owned a hotel called The Sanddollar in a place called Lauderdale by the Sea, um, in Fort Lauderdale, and it was fantastic time and when we had the chance to spend time together and just go out on the beach and at night we would go out to dinner I remember going to a Benihana Japanese steakhouse, and we just felt like we had freedom, and then we weren't yet 21 so we weren't allowed to go to clubs in Fort Lauderdale, so we basically spent our time, uh, watching movies in the hotel room or just walking along the strip and I remember going out for ice cream one night and just walking along the boardwalk it was very, very peaceful time, and the worst part of the vacation was getting sunburned, um, because I'm extremely pale, and going out on the beach<n>everyday for hours on end turned me into a lobster, and, um, my friend Crystal would always joke with me and call me, um, her lobster.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt
You know, I all of a sudden ran out of the house with no explanation, but it was very comforting to spend that time with my friend, and I didn't want to be alone and it was a really good experience.<n>My friend Maria Cartsokalis, um, who I went to school with at St. Andrew's, and we became friends when I was in fifth or sixth grade and she lived across the street from me and I loved to go to her house because she had a pool and my parents did not.<n>And so I would go over there and we would watch TV on Saturday mornings, and usually I would spend the night, and, um, so we'd watch TV during the day and then we would go shopping at the mall and her mom always gave us 20 dollars to spend on anything we wanted so that was always fun and I remember we would during the day watch music videos and just hang out and have fun, and she had an older sister named Tina, and it was in high school, and we were in grade school at the time, and we would always try on her clothes and because she was really stylish and had the Guess?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt
My friend Maria Cartsokalis, um, who I went to school with at St. Andrew's, and we became friends when I was in fifth or sixth grade and she lived across the street from me and I loved to go to her house because she had a pool and my parents did not.<n>And so I would go over there and we would watch TV on Saturday mornings, and usually I would spend the night, and, um, so we'd watch TV during the day and then we would go shopping at the mall and her mom always gave us 20 dollars to spend on anything we wanted so that was always fun and I remember we would during the day watch music videos and just hang out and have fun, and she had an older sister named Tina, and it was in high school, and we were in grade school at the time, and we would always try on her clothes and because she was really stylish and had the Guess?<n>jeans and the jean jackets, and the cute, you know, skirts and tops and I don't know what happened to our friendship, Maria and mine.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt
She, her locker was next to mine and I remember one day we just said, "Hi," to each other for the first time after ignoring each other for the entire year, and, um, it was liberating, it was great that we could finally talk and make up, and since then, um, you know, we've kept in touch when we were both in college, and I ran into her here in Charlotte about a couple of weeks ago.<n>It seems that we go to the same church St. Gabriel's Catholic Church here in Charlotte and it was neat to see her here because I didn't realize she had moved to Charlotte.<n>I thought she was still living in Myrtle Beach where her parents lived so.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt
The meager looking pieces.<n>So my mother use to sit back in her chair in the den and talk about how one Saturday Granny, uh, had decided she was going to go to town and you know back then, you're talking, oh probably 1930s, early 1930s, uh, my mother would've been 10 or 12, somewhere around there, and Granny, uh, went to the train track to get on the little trolley train, whatever they had at that time to come downtown.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LeakJeffrey.txt
It was a diesel.<n>And so this Sunday morning we had eaten breakfast and we're getting Granny situated in her wheelchair and everything and that was pretty much my job, and I told my mom and my sister to go out to the car and open the trunk.<n>And my sister Rita did that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LeakJeffrey.txt
I said, "Well, I say Granny, Mama's calling me.<n>Something's wrong, but let's go on out and I'll get you situated in the car."<n>And, um, get her in there and around to the back.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LeakJeffrey.txt
And he never told or anything.<n>Well the thing about it was in, I'm sort of telling this story out of order, but my grand, after my grandfather died and my great grandmother was sort of alone, um, it must have been right around Thanksgiving and she was feeling real depressed or whatever and this lady came and invited her to come to dinner, and when she, and so my grandmother didn't think she really wanted to go and everything, but she thought, "Well, OK," she'd go ahead and go.<n>And so she went in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LidingtonLinda.txt
It's just a big circle, uh, and, there's nothing to do there.<n>If you want to go shopping you have to go about thirty miles, other than grocery store, um, you have to, everybody goes to Asheville to shop, because there's no, there's no stores to shop there except for just like family-owned, little clothing stores and stuff, stuff nobody wants.<n>Isn't that where they filmed the movie Nell, and weren't your grandparents a part of that film?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt
But as far as the people goes, people in Robinsville are much friendlier.<n>Th, like I say, there's no, you can't go shopping or anything so there's a lot of family time spent, you know, you, there's a lot a,<n>a lot of visiting, and people take time for each other up there, there's not the hustle and bustle that's down here, so, life's a lot slower pace there.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt
Um, OK, well, so, do you think you'll ever want to travel, or, and if you do, where do you want to travel to?<n>I would like to go to Scotland I know, Scotland and Ireland, um, just because I think, the, I think the land's beautiful, I like the accent, and I just think it would be a neat place to go.<n>I'm not really, Paris, Europe, doesn't really drill me, um, I'd like to go to Scotland and Ireland, and of course the Bahamas, or Hawaii, everybody wants to go there, but, that's um, I guess Scotland would just be the place I'd most like to go.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt
I would like to go to Scotland I know, Scotland and Ireland, um, just because I think, the, I think the land's beautiful, I like the accent, and I just think it would be a neat place to go.<n>I'm not really, Paris, Europe, doesn't really drill me, um, I'd like to go to Scotland and Ireland, and of course the Bahamas, or Hawaii, everybody wants to go there, but, that's um, I guess Scotland would just be the place I'd most like to go.<n>OK, um, your mom also lives here in Lincolnton and I've never known a, a family, and I'm talking about you, your sister, and your mom, and your brother, who is more close in such a functional yet dysfunctional way.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt
Um, I remember Christmas, some Christmases with my dad, um, because, I remember one Christmas we got every, we always got everything on Christmas Eve because my mom couldn't wait.<n>Um, and I remember the day that um, I was five years old and I was getting ready to go to kindergarten when my mom told me that my dad wasn't coming home, and um, it was the summer before I went in kindergarten.<n>And I was sitting in my dad's chair waiting on him to come home and, uh, my uh, momma told me daddy wasn't coming home, but uh, that's really the only two things I remember about my daddy being young, uh, I remember one other night, with uh, when he took my brother and sister to a, um, a race car, um, a race or something, but I stayed at home with my mom, and that's really the only three times that I remember my dad, before they split up.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt
I think when we had our funnest times, I mean those times were fun, but we also when, when we were involved in youth and stuff like that we had fun then too, so we didn't--<n>Did you go to the beach with us?<n>Fort Caswell, yeah--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt
.<n>Um, I've been asked, I asked dad and Linda the same question because it's such a cheesy question, but I'm going to go ahead and ask you, since we're coming upon the year two thousand, what was your favorite movie of all time and why?<n>Um, I guess it would d, d, da, da, da, da, da, probably Dirty Dancing.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt
Yeah, well,<n>um, I had, OK, Jennifer, I, it been like a couple days about a week or so and I hadn't had time to go up and see her and I spent a whole lot of time with her and her kids,<n>this is before I got married, so you know I spent the night with her a lot, and um, we, we were friends and I went to lay down with her little boy one night to put him to bed because he wouldn't go to sleep by his self and I had worked all day so I was really tired and I went and laid down with him and me and him fell asleep.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt
um, I had, OK, Jennifer, I, it been like a couple days about a week or so and I hadn't had time to go up and see her and I spent a whole lot of time with her and her kids,<n>this is before I got married, so you know I spent the night with her a lot, and um, we, we were friends and I went to lay down with her little boy one night to put him to bed because he wouldn't go to sleep by his self and I had worked all day so I was really tired and I went and laid down with him and me and him fell asleep.<n>Well, Jennifer came back there and she woke me up, and, um, she said, "Tabatha," and I'm like "Um huh," and she's like "Tabatha get up and spend some time with me you hadn't, you know I hadn't seen you all week , please get up and talk to me for a little while," and I was real sleepy and I'm like, "OK Jennifer."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt
um, I'm scared," so I'm like "OK Jennifer", and she made me a pallet at the end of her bed and we were we were asleep and I was almost asleep and all of the sudden we heard this noise and it sounded like it came from the bed, and Jennifer said, "Tabatha I hope that was you," and I said "no I was hoping that that was one of y'all," and she said, "No, it came from down there," and I said, "No, it came from up there".<n>Well, she looked at the clock and she's like, "Tabatha, get up get up now and come in the living room," and we went in the living room and sh, and I'm like, "What Jennifer", you know I wanted to go to sleep, and um, she said, "Did you see what time it was?"<n>And I said, "No I didn't see what time it was," and she said, "It was 2:15," well at the time that meant nothing to me, but um, she explained to me and later we watched the Amityville Horrors, and then it really started making sense to me, and speaking of Amityville Horrors, my house<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt
Of course she, at the time, was living in Gastonia and really didn't know her way around Charlotte very much at all.<n>So we decided to go to Omega Sports, which is at the Arboretum.<n>We were at our tennis club, which is over near Quail Corners Shopping Center, it's really not all that terribly convenient.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt
So, we went back, played our match, and as has always been the case with Sally and I, or most of the time has been the case with Sally and I, we won this match.<n>After it was over, everyone wanted to go out and eat, but I couldn't because Jocelyn was at home.<n>And I said, "I can't, I really thought this was just a tennis match, I've got to go home, my daughter's there."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt
After it was over, everyone wanted to go out and eat, but I couldn't because Jocelyn was at home.<n>And I said, "I can't, I really thought this was just a tennis match, I've got to go home, my daughter's there."<n>So, I went home, didn't hear anything for a while.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt
So, I went home, didn't hear anything for a while.<n>A couple of weeks later, Sally called and invited me to go to Jazz Fest uptown.<n>She explained a story about a group of people from work and I think maybe they'd even rented a van, um, and were making the rounds, I can't remember all the details of it, but she said, "and I thought maybe you'd want to go," and she added this cleverly, "unless you're seeing someone else."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt
So we, once again, parted ways.<n>Several weeks later, after the other relationship had run its course and had been completely wound down, um, I invited Sally to go to a, um, I think 25th anniversary party with some, some people that I worked with.<n>Um, we ended up getting together that Friday night before, to meet some other friends of mine to kind of give her a baptism by fire.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt
He said, "That's no problem.<n>We'll go get it.<n>Where do you work?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt
He said, "We have a problem."<n>See he hates to go downtown.<n>So he put me in his car and we went to the nearest Omega Sports and bought me some shoes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt
That was impressive.<n>But we had a neat opportunity to talk in the car and we talked and laughed `cause we were both kind a nervous and kind of silly, and we go out to play tennis and we're still being silly and talking and laughing and playing against our good friends Glenn and Fred, who we never should've lost a game to as we proceeded to lose the first set because your dad couldn't keep the ball on the court, basically.<n>Ha, ha, but I know he'll say the same thing.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt
Anyway we decided we weren't going to lose the match, so we settled down and we played and won and had a good time, and I thought, "Well cool.<n>I bet we go out to eat now.<n>It is Friday night, it's about eight thirty or nine."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt
Actually, I was just looking for another excuse to call him.<n>So I picked up the phone about two weeks later and called him and told him that Jazz Charlotte was going on, nope it was called Jazz Fest, and that the company I worked for had a shuttle bus, which it did, and people signed up for it and you got to go to Jazz Fest, and it was a lot a fun and, and I said, "I don't know your status.<n>I don't know if you're dating anybody at the time, but if you're not and you'd like to go, I would love for you to be my guest."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt
But about six weeks later I get this phone call from someone asking for Chrissy Everett identifying himself as Jimmy Connors and it was, guess who?<n>And he said there was a party, an anniversary party for some people that he worked with and did I want to go, and he was sorry that he didn't get to go to Jazz Fest with me, but he had been dating somebody and it was somebody that he used to be engaged to and then wasn't engaged to and they had reconciled, but he knew it wasn't going work out, but yet they were still dating when I played tennis with him but, they're not dating anymore.<n>And I said, "Well cool."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt
And all my life she constantly brought us back and forth from, um, France to, um, America, um, to visit my family there.<n>So I still am fluent in French and I am very thankful for that, um, because recently, when my grandmother came to visit, she has never had heart trouble, and, um, never had anything go wrong with her heart or anything, and one day, while she was here, which was, here recently her heart rate dropped real low, so we had to, um, rush her to the emergency room, and this was something very scary for her because she doesn't speak any English.<n>She speaks like one or two words of English, um, not to mention, she doesn't like to, going to the doctor, so it was like we had to hit her over the head to bring her there.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LuhrChantal.txt
Um, and when they say it rains, it pours because my mom, um, recently moved back in with me, but I don't know how long that will be, but, um, she did and she had been up one night from, she had gotten up one morning at like five o'clock in the morning.<n>By the time I had got home from work, and so forth, it was like 11 o'clock at night and she was extremely tired, but my mom is one of these people who constantly has to go and do something, she can't sit still, it drives her crazy.<n>So she thinks she's going to make, you know, she moved all her stuff back in my house, and she thinks she's going to clean it up all in one day, so my house is like a tornado hit it by this time, but, you know, I'm fine.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LuhrChantal.txt
I haven't said anything about it because, you know, I know it's going take a few days, but she wants to do it all in one day, so she's still up at like 11:30 at night, going back and forth between the attic, which, you know, in the, in, the attic is in the top of my house.<n>You have to climb a ladder, a pull-down ladder, to get, to it, and I was telling her, you know, she'd needed to be careful, she needed to go to bed because she was tired, and, furthermore there is like a hairline crack in my ceiling in my bedroom, um, where apparently she had stepped wrong or stepped on the wrong place or something before, and it created a hairline crack, and I was telling, and I stressed to her, you know, "Be careful," you know, "don't step in this area."<n>There's a hairline crack in my ceiling.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LuhrChantal.txt
But, um, she, she would tell me about how, the kind of trouble they would get into, and, and how strict her parents were.<n>And if she, she would go to the store and buy them bread.<n>And one day she went to buy them bread and she came back with the incorrect change and so her dad got very angry with her and made her go back to the store and, and I guess the guy had given her too much money back and she hadn't told him that he had made a mistake and so she got in trouble way, way too much trouble, you know, unnecessary trouble, and she had to walk all the way back to the store, and I don't know, she just made it out that to seem like in a lot of ways, back then, times were, seemed so much better, and yet so much harsher in a lot of ways.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ManserAlexis.txt
And if she, she would go to the store and buy them bread.<n>And one day she went to buy them bread and she came back with the incorrect change and so her dad got very angry with her and made her go back to the store and, and I guess the guy had given her too much money back and she hadn't told him that he had made a mistake and so she got in trouble way, way too much trouble, you know, unnecessary trouble, and she had to walk all the way back to the store, and I don't know, she just made it out that to seem like in a lot of ways, back then, times were, seemed so much better, and yet so much harsher in a lot of ways.<n>And supposedly, you know, it snowed more back then and, ah, but, you know, family was closer knit, I guess, so, you know, pros and cons in every, every case but and my, my grandpa, called Jidu in Arabic.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ManserAlexis.txt
He kept bugging her and bugging her and she just wouldn't let him mess with it, you know.<n>And so, he threatened, he said, "I'm going to go sit in the fire!"<n>And she said, "Go ahead!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_McCloskeyKevin.txt
So she ran over to the box and, um, when she saw the box she, uh, she saw that she had put the dog on backwards so its legs were facing two different directions.<n>And then, because she was trying to rush it, you know, trying to keep him alive, she said he would run on two feet, he would run around the whole yard, whole yard and as soon as he would get tired he would jump, do a flip, and go on the other two feet and just keep on running.<n>That's pretty funny.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_McCloskeyKevin.txt
The other guy didn't even get to touch the ball.<n>So, but, um, my grandmother had 10 siblings and, um, she used to tell me when they were little there used to be a creek over by their house, and, um, she used to run, they used to get vines off the tree and just, they would swing on them, and like every week some kid, just being stupid, would break their arm or break their leg, break fingers or something and go crying home.<n>And the parents are just, they would never show them, they would always have the perfect swing but they would always point to a bad one and they would just cut them down and just have it, and everybody would just keep breaking their arms and stuff and, um, I don't know.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_McCloskeyKevin.txt
And Bebe Parker was a boy that, um, got sucked into a drainage pipe one, one day and, um, he died.<n>And, uh, every year I'd go there, they would take the whole troop out there and I'd be so scared!<n>And they'd be out there, they'd be like "Bebe Parker!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_McCloskeyKevin.txt
And I was so amazed because I thought it was the coolest thing.<n>And we used to go snipe hunting when we would go talk to Bebe Parker.<n>And the Scout leaders would go, "I see a snipe!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_McCloskeyKevin.txt
And, ah, anyway, she, she decide,<n>she said that she was, that she made this decision that she was going to go into the convent, and become a nun.<n>And, of course, everybody in the family was absolutely hysterical and put out about this, but my, and my aunt, her, her, her, her response to the whole thing was that she needed to see a psychiatrist, meaning my aunt needed to see a psychiatrist to get her over the,<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt
So, uh, but anyway, Deirdre was really, she, she, she was a, she really believed that that's what she wanted and that was what she should do.<n>And, uh, as I go along, I'll, I'll talk a little bit more about, you know, my, my family's interpretation of this whole thing because that's part of what when I, when I think of Deirdre and I think of the loss of Deirdre, some of what I try to come to terms with is why, why my family interpreted her choice the way they did.<n>But, um, because the, the general consensus was that she was too scared or somehow felt insecure and she couldn't be a part of the world they never, they never said, "Oh, she, she did this because this is what she believes."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt
You know, it was simply that, "Oh, she doesn't know what she's doing, and she's misguided, and she's scared," that was the general consensus.<n>Anyway, she became a nun, and, um, I would go and visit her.<n>And, um, she was, she became, she was a teaching nun, she taught in a school, um, Marymount was the name of the, uh, of the convent and, and the school, and they had a, a school in Tarrytown but they also had a school in Manhattan.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt
She ultimately ended up teaching art, because she was a very, very gifted artist, um, at Marymount.<n>And when I would go over, first she was at Tarrytown, initially, and I would go over and I would visit her from time to time, and it was always just a joy to, you know, to see her.<n>And at that time, this was, this was before Vatican II, and she was fully garbed and it was, and it was strange, because I had been very close to her, I was very little when, but she was very, very kind to me, and she was always very interested in me and would take me places, and include me and so it was strange for me to, you know, suddenly see her in, in, in, um, all in black, ah, with profuse robes, and, she had a, the, um, head dress was very, it was, it was shaped like this, it was, so you, um, really could not see very much of her face, so that was, that was a very strange thing for me, but she always seemed happy.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt
And then, she, she was, she, she was, because she was convalescing, they, she stayed in New York, they, they didn't send her overseas again.<n>And she, she was teaching at Marymount and I would go in and visit her.<n>And, um, she, she was also taking classes at the Art Students' League, and I was taking classes at the Art Students' League, so we would pass in the halls, and she would show me what she was doing, and, um, and as I say, she was a very gifted artist, and she loved teaching and again, she still seemed very, you know I never got a sense with Deirdre of there may have been discontent<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt
that maybe she had made wrong choices, but, um, she never expressed that.<n>At some point this was, right about the time of Vatican II, because she started to wear different clothes, and it was, it was very, um, it was very discreet, I mean, she didn't suddenly just go out to Bloomingdale's and buy a whole lot of, you know,<n>fashionable clothes, but, when I would go in to visit with my, um, with my aunt, and if she was, if she was there, she was dressed in, in, um, very, very, uh, very elegant but understated, you know, suits and things like that, but she definitely was no longer in the full garb.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt
At some point this was, right about the time of Vatican II, because she started to wear different clothes, and it was, it was very, um, it was very discreet, I mean, she didn't suddenly just go out to Bloomingdale's and buy a whole lot of, you know,<n>fashionable clothes, but, when I would go in to visit with my, um, with my aunt, and if she was, if she was there, she was dressed in, in, um, very, very, uh, very elegant but understated, you know, suits and things like that, but she definitely was no longer in the full garb.<n>And, uh, my aunt at that time had, was diagnosed as having lung cancer and she was very sick.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt
And, uh, my aunt at that time had, was diagnosed as having lung cancer and she was very sick.<n>So Deirdre took, was, took a leave from the convent, she was given, um, permission, to, um, for temporary leave, and I don't know logistically how that works, but she was, she was allowed to go home and, and be with her mother, to help her, um, go through, she was going to die, I mean everybody knew that she was going to die, but to be with her through that whole period, and, um, she did have some operations.<n>And, um, at that point Deirdre made the decision, and her mother did die, and it was, it was all very traumatic, my father was very sick, he's a manic depressive, so we were going through all of that, and he was very upset with the medical profession for how they were treating my aunt, and this and that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt
And, um, at that point Deirdre made the decision, and her mother did die, and it was, it was all very traumatic, my father was very sick, he's a manic depressive, so we were going through all of that, and he was very upset with the medical profession for how they were treating my aunt, and this and that.<n>But anyway, Deirdre made the decision that she wasn't going to go back to the convent.<n>And she had already taken final vows, so it was a big, it was a huge thing, for her to make that decision.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt
you know, did you, did you feel more alive, making that choice, and actually dying, under those conditions?"<n>But I can't ask her, I can only just go on asking myself, sort of rhetorically, you know, When did you feel more real?<n>And then you know, the question for my family is, "Why couldn't you accept her decision?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt
I told Mama it was embarrassing for my friends to come by there, ride by there, there he was laying in the yard passed out.<n>So the next time he started to lay down in the yard Mama told him, she said, "Clayton, if I were you would not lay down in the yard and go to sleep."<n>He mumbled something or other and laid down in the yard and went to sleep.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillerFlora.txt
He mumbled something or other and laid down in the yard and went to sleep.<n>She took him by his feet and we had steps to go up on the porch.<n>And pulled him up, his head going, "Bump, bump, bump," all the way up them steps.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillerFlora.txt
I would read the True Story magazine sometimes and think, "Good gosh she didn't have it any rougher then I did.<n>And why did she go out and become a heron addict or--"<n>Was your whole life bad or did you have anything good happen?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillerFlora.txt
we went everywhere together.<n>Well, we didn't go to many places because we couldn't sneak out that much.<n>You were quite an artist too.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillerFlora.txt
They taught me what I ought to know.<n>To get the job right before I was to go for the interview they told me everything I suppose to know when I went in there I knew it.<n>That's good.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillerFlora.txt
I had been going over there and helping the temporary inspector anyway.<n>We had to learn about the air gauges, how much air would go in them things that make those, I can't even remember the name of them now.<n>Fly open and shut when you put air to it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillerFlora.txt
Well, she'd, Elma had a lot of warnings about school.<n>She didn't go to school?<n>Playing hooky.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillerFlora.txt
When you moved to Charlotte?<n>Well, we saw each other after I moved to Charlotte when I go back down there to visit, but when she moved to um, some,<n>I can't think of the name of the place.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillerFlora.txt
It, it wasn't the same.<n>I guess you just can't go back, but I still would like to see her.<n>But when we uh, drive through Wadesboro going to the beach and everything, nothings the same down there either.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillerFlora.txt
my, my mother she died, you know, before I really, you know, knowed her. I was small, my brother, it was just the two of us, you see, and my grandmother didn't have but five girls, she didn't have any boys. And out of the five girls didn't but one have children and that was my mother. And then she had a girl and boy, Babe and myself. Babe was older than I was and I was second. But when she died she was 35 years old, so they told me. And, um, was then when I got up, you know, and they told me she died when she was 35, I knowed I was going to die when I got 35 years old!<n>So I got scared! Yeah, I knowed I was going to die. But I said it, it, uh, you see what, when Babe and I was going, Babe was, would want me to, he'd go out with them boys and children and learn, you know, things. Well he'd want me to do everything, he'd come back and want me to do it. He'd want me to, to, wanted to try to learn me to ride the bicycle. I always was scared of everything, you know. And he'd get mad. Well they'd go out there and they'd get rabbit tobacco-<n>JBM: -and they'd chew it, come back, and he have me, want me to<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillsJanie.txt

JBM: And he said, "Just blow it in, then blow out," then maybe I'd go choking.<n>I'd go to coughing and go out there and then he'd get mad at me!<n>JBM: "Oh you can't do nothing!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillsJanie.txt

JBM: One year, Christmas, say, he going to get up there and say a little speech, you know,<n>and then, we had, you know, a little store out, well it wasn't far from us, you go out a little dirt road, you know, and then you'd have to turn, turn to your right and then back to your left to the little store.<n>And she'd send me to the store and I'd have to repeat it, what I was going after<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillsJanie.txt
Uh-huh.JBM: So they put, put Josephine, that was her name, and I told her, you know, I said, "Leave me alone, now.<n>You go on, now," because I was scared, you know, to bother anybody because I know I'd get a beating if I did!<n>And, uh, she kept on, she kept on after me, and all of them was around there, you know, just, the children was terrible then, you know!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillsJanie.txt
Right here was a little gully.<n>Right here was a little patch to get out in the big path you know, to go home.<n>And so she kept on!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillsJanie.txt
The strength would come to me, you know, and I got mad, honey!<n>But honey, when I got home I knowed, I dread to go home, because I knowed I was going to get it!<n>JBM: Ooh!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillsJanie.txt
Oh Lord!<n>All them, all they could go around there just so pretty, they might come out.<n>But me?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillsJanie.txt
One time we lived down in Brooklyn and Miss Sara and she taking care and she did laundry for these millionaires out there on, uh, I can't call the place now, but anyway and she'd come then she'd get Aunt Winnie and several people to help her, you know, do the washing and ironing.<n>And one day then, I, I think we didn't have to go to school or something, but I went down and, Miss Wheeler was her name, she said, "Don't you want to iron a shirt?"<n>"Oh yeah, but you-," I said, "I can't iron."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillsJanie.txt
Put me in there on an ironing board.<n>And every time I'd iron there, then there'd be a wrinkle here and every time I iron there, I said, I said "I don't want to go down to Miss Wheeler's<n>no more!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillsJanie.txt
no more!"<n>I wouldn't go down there no more either.<n>I couldn't iron no white shirts or nothing else `cause I hated it!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillsJanie.txt
Miami, Florida was almost too much for six people in a car to be together for a 10-day period.<n>But coming home we stopped in New Orleans and my dad had been on a roller coaster in San Francisco and he thought it was such fun and so we went to Pontchartrain Beach in New Orleans and that was nearing the end of the vacation and he said he wanted my brother Fred and me to go for the experience, he thought it was going to be so much fun.<n>So we were all excited about it and got on.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MottSara.txt
I helped rear her because my mother played bridge.<n>Every, it seemed like every day, but every other day and she would have her lady friends and I would have to go in and tend to the babies and make sure that they were dry or had their pacifier or their bottle.<n>And, then, my sister Gay was seven years younger and I felt the same way about her.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MottSara.txt
If somebody wanted to come in and, and purchase some type of hardware then I would get the nails, put them in a sack, and weigh them.<n>Then I would go to the cash register and punch my number in and hand ring the cash register.<n>That was really exciting.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MottSara.txt
No big deal.<n>All right, my name is Sarah Murphy and I was born in Charlotte, NC, and my story is um, that my family has had a lake house for a very, very long time and, um, I've always been told that my great-grandfather and all of us, we have a tradition that usually every July 4th we go up there and we set off firecrackers and just kind of watch the neighbors and see their firecrackers.<n>And we just take a boat ride and do a cookout and all this.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MurphySarah.txt
So I've always been told that my great-grandfather, whom I've never met, one time was up at the lake and they were doing their traditional July 4th deal, um, and they were setting off the firecrackers and he accidentally just, I guess, got some messed up firecrackers, or set them off too soon, or what not, but he was right there and they kind of blew his fingers off.<n>So that was really, and I've always been told that, and like I said, I've never met him or anything, but I was just kind of surprised that that happened and it taught me, I guess, to never go near firecrackers.<n>I don't go within ten feet of them.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MurphySarah.txt
So that was really, and I've always been told that, and like I said, I've never met him or anything, but I was just kind of surprised that that happened and it taught me, I guess, to never go near firecrackers.<n>I don't go within ten feet of them.<n>So that's my story I guess.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MurphySarah.txt
Yeah.<n>Did you go to the library?<n>Did they take you to the library?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MylesDorian.txt
I would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it, was a really big thing to go to the movie on Saturday mornings.<n>And one particular movie theater we went to, they would show serials every Saturday, which were a continued story.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you, um, wouldn't know what had taken place.<n>So we would go every Saturday morning.<n>And also at this theater, they gave prizes to different people.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And one of the way they gave prizes was, they would take big group photos and everybody, and there were stairs going up to a balcony, real wide stairs.<n>And the big group of people would go stand on the stairs and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture.<n>And they'd take the picture and then you would go back the next Saturday after they had been developed and they would have circled 3 or 4 people in the picture and the people whose head was circled would get the prizes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And the big group of people would go stand on the stairs and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture.<n>And they'd take the picture and then you would go back the next Saturday after they had been developed and they would have circled 3 or 4 people in the picture and the people whose head was circled would get the prizes.<n>Is that for real?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And another, um, that was in, that was in High Point, NC.<n>And then we moved to Charlotte and we used to go to � and I don't think its even still there I don't know if the building is or not � but the Dilworth Theatre.<n>I lived in the Dilworth area, and we would go to the Dilworth Theatre and I do remember that it cost 9 cents to get a ticket to get in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And then we moved to Charlotte and we used to go to � and I don't think its even still there I don't know if the building is or not � but the Dilworth Theatre.<n>I lived in the Dilworth area, and we would go to the Dilworth Theatre and I do remember that it cost 9 cents to get a ticket to get in.<n>And we would, could go to the movie.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
I lived in the Dilworth area, and we would go to the Dilworth Theatre and I do remember that it cost 9 cents to get a ticket to get in.<n>And we would, could go to the movie.<n>We would get maybe 15 cents each to go to the movie, and I sound like I'm 95 years old-<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And we would, could go to the movie.<n>We would get maybe 15 cents each to go to the movie, and I sound like I'm 95 years old-<n>-with those kinds of prices.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
-with those kinds of prices.<n>Um, but we would go to the movie and then you would go in and get your, your snack that you wanted.<n>And there were several different choices.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And one other form of refreshment that we got, which really embarrassed my mother because she didn't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday, there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre.<n>And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this.<n>We would go into the bakery and we would ask for-<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this.<n>We would go into the bakery and we would ask for-<n>-a nickel worth of scraps!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And that's all the stories I can remember about the movies right now.<n>I do know that I did used to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre.<n>And when I was young, it wasn't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
I do know that I did used to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre.<n>And when I was young, it wasn't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie.<n>I mean, my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back, but today you wouldn't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother; you just wouldn't do it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswomen.<n>And we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together and then when we grew up, we sure did; we got an apartment.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
But in my mind I can remember playing that, like all day long.<n>And we would go over to my grandparents' and they had a a big white house with a big front porch and, uh, banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch.<n>And it was just a great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or, uh, it could be a castle; just do many things with it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
Everybody had their own "best" friend but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together.<n>Um, and we would, had that many girls but we would only go out in a couple of cars and I remember one of the girls, Betty Belle, her dad had a VW Beetle, and we'd fit like 5 girls in that VW Beetle.<n>Did Betty Belle turn Catholic?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
We just did what we could get away with.<n>Anyway, that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre, and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it's kind of a, pretty much of a spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time.<n>So we bought our tickets and we went into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat, file, all filed in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
"Until we," you know, "Pick up the new Maxima."<n>So two weeks go by.<n>We ask him about the car again.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NesbittFrank.txt
He don't drive the car, wife got it.<n>This go on for about a week.<n>Next thing I know, we in this little, like it's, like this little park, it's not even a parking center, it's like a driveway, and it's got to Boston Market and a uh, uh, beauty salon on the side of it, and some other thing, I think maybe, I don't know, you know what I'm saying.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NesbittFrank.txt
Yeah, talking about he don't like my attitude because when I come in now, I don't smile at him, you know what I'm saying, I don't carry on a conversation with him.<n>I just go on and do my job, do a good job, and, you know, and I go.<n>That wasn't good enough for him.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NesbittFrank.txt
People automatically want to make up these, these, you know, these groups but it's not true not for each and every one of us.<n>And then the ones that those, uh, uh, particular things that, uh, uh, classify that group, soon as I get, know what I'm saying, uh, affected by it, or have to go through, I'm either caught off guard, or it hurts me, or shit, sometimes it could destroy people.<n>I mean, because that's not me and I'm caught off, I wasn't expecting that, you know what I'm saying, but anyway he fired me, fired me.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NesbittFrank.txt
I, it's just crazy, it's crazy, it's crazy.<n>That's why when I do go to school here, I'm going to go to school here for dirt cheap because I been living here since they robbed us with Angie and everything, so I'm going to go for cheap, hurt them, and then I'm, I'm gone.<n>I'm leaving.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NesbittFrank.txt
And we had never lived in the South before, except for one other brief, brief time I should say we had lived in Camden, SC um, where act, actually one of my brothers was born.<n>But when I was seven, we moved to Pensacola, FL, and um, we, there were four children, and we were enrolled in a Catholic school, because my parents were Catholics, and um, they wanted us to go to the Catholic schools in the South.<n>So, I went to, I was in the second grade, and I went to Sacred Heart School in Pensacola, FL.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_O_ConnorChris.txt
Um so, um yes, we've come a long, long way since when I was a little girl.<n>But we still have a long way to go too.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_O_ConnorChris.txt
So any time we saw people walking down the street that look didn't look familiar, `cause we had a pretty close knit community, so we had people walking around the neighborhood or whatever, you know what I'm saying, that looked funny, everybody would be scared.<n>Everybody'd go run in the house.<n>And we were some bad kids, too!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt
Orr Road, right over there like going to UNCC, to Hampshire Hill through the back way.<n>I had to go through the little, sorry park in our neighborhood.<n>And I remember running the whole way and I wasn't even, I wasn't in shape or nothing.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt
And you know kids, we was playing sports, always out at night being bad, so you know what I'm saying, so anytime the Butt Hole Bandit came up everybody got tense.<n>Everybody was ready to go home.<n>Everybody was ready to go in somebody's house stay in or whatnot.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt
Everybody was ready to go home.<n>Everybody was ready to go in somebody's house stay in or whatnot.<n>You used to purposely spend the night over to people's house cause you scared to walk home.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt

It's still there now, but I remember, and I still do when we, when I go to the family reunions.<n>We go out to the chicken coop and it stink.<n>I don't go in there though, but I always go out to the, uh, where they got the cows and the bulls at, and check them out and go and get up on desk stand and see where they at.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt
We go out to the chicken coop and it stink.<n>I don't go in there though, but I always go out to the, uh, where they got the cows and the bulls at, and check them out and go and get up on desk stand and see where they at.<n>And, um, he even still got some of those old kettles back there they broke and all mess up and stuff, and his kettles were hidden inside the chicken coop.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt
They got to pay though, you know, to come on the property because there're deer stand all throughout.<n>And I think they should make them pay to fish because big ass lake, a big old lake out there, and they, you know, I want to go fishing there, but I'm driving from out of town and it ain't like I'm carrying some fishing rods or nothing.<n>They got, they got, um, I think they should make people pay to fish too, and the people it's his, it's his niece, that's my Aunt Claudia.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt

Mmm, basically, something different.<n>Did you get to go to the library when you were little?<n>Uh-huh, all the time.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PolkMaria.txt
Well, my uncle was always telling stories and, uh, we had this house across the street from where I grew up that was old and he ever finished it.<n>He started it and he told stories that, um, um, men being in it that house at night and stuff and for us not to go outside at night.<n>Would he scare you?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PolkMaria.txt
Yeah.<n>So we, at a certain time, we were scared to go over there because we'd always go outside and look at the house across the street.<n>Um, did he tell stories to big groups of people, or just one-on-one?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PolkMaria.txt
OK I had the worst day ever.<n>OK I go up to this oil change place, right?<n>And, um, I say, "OK the reason," OK I'm going to start from the very beginning.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
So I call when I get home to get their prices to compare to the University Lube where I normally get it done and it's 26 dollars for an oil change with free tire rotation, which was much cheaper than the University.<n>So I'm like, "All right I'm going to go there, get my shit done, I needed a uh a tire rotation."<n>So I go in there, only person there.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
So I'm like, "All right I'm going to go there, get my shit done, I needed a uh a tire rotation."<n>So I go in there, only person there.<n>I pull in, I say, "I need my inspection done," my inspection went out in November, "and an oil change with the free tire rotation," that's what I said.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
I pull in, I say, "I need my inspection done," my inspection went out in November, "and an oil change with the free tire rotation," that's what I said.<n>He goes, "OK we'll take care of you," and so I go sit in the waiting room and read my little book.<n>This is the place you were talking bout?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
Yes it's down by, uh, it's called Pennzoil.<n>Don't ever go there<n>.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
"I might not even pass your inspection.<n>You might need to just need to go ahead and get them today."<n>I said, "Fine how much are they?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
Then I go.<n>All right, go back in, different guy, they're doing the oil change now, comes in, he goes, "Uh you wanted a tire rotation right?"<n>I said, "Yeah."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
.<n>I say, "Well I want you to know that I just drove 15 minutes to get here and didn't go to my normal place, where I know the people because of this huge great deal y'all have going on," you know?<n>And he goes, "Oh no, no, no, no, no.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
he said, "That's why I came here," and dadadadada.<n>He said, "I normally go to this other place."<n>And I said, "Well they're not going to do it."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
And I said, "Fine, fine, fine."<n>So I go back in the waiting room and I'm like, "All right dude.<n>Now they can't rotate my tires," you know?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
I will not do it anymore.<n>I, I tried and I tried and it will not go back in."<n>And I'm like--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
I'm like, "Thank God," you know.<n>So I go over there and he's like, "Your total is 68 something or other."<n>I went, because normally, inspection's what, like 10 dollars?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
She was a voter.<n>Although she was 92 or 93 at the time, she was going to get in her car and go vote one way or the other.<n>And so, I would try to explain to her how it was very important, with all the growth we were experiencing in Cabarrus County, to keep the, uh, the number of kids in the classrooms to less than 30 if we could, and we weren't meeting that with the growth.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt
And, uh, my wife's family is scattered, uh, back in OH and in FL and Denver, CO. But we find that a, a fairly intentional way, every year, of getting together and we enjoy just, uh, doing some fairly mundane things.<n>But when we get together, we, um, that is, we just enjoy eating food, we enjoy putting puzzles together, we sometimes go to the beach and just do as little as we can as possible, and just enjoy, you know, doing things together.<n>So we have a fairly, um, I would say, strong family and important to us, and are fairly intentional about getting together as often as we can.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt
We were used to, um, probably some smaller parks and, and, and larger parks, regional parks and state parks.<n>But we would often go to, to hike, and actually they had cabins and things like that, other activities and, with them that we did.<n>Um, but people-wise, I think we've, we've found people to be probably pretty much the, what you hear about in the South.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt
Um, she was like OH, you guys came for the perfect time, it's um St. Patrick's Day and we're having parties and parties, and all this stuff.<n>So, I couldn't go out, I think I was like 19 years old and you have to be like 21, uh, 18 in some clubs and 21 to drink, and we decided not to go out, considering everything that had happened that day.<n>So, we woke up the next morning, we went down and we drove down to FL.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt
However, Allison wasn't paying attention and she stepped on a fish and it got a barb, which is one of it's defense mechanisms, stuck in her foot, so it was really painful and her foot swelled up and everything.<n>So, we go to this gas station and they tell us we have to go to the hospital, so we go to the hospital in Cape Coral and I think we were there for probably ten hours.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt
Can I talk now?<n>Yeah go ahead and try it.<n>OK, I was four years old, from what my mom tells me I was four years old, and I was walking on the beach with my grandfather and apparently I stepped on a sticker bush and I had like four stickers in my foot<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt
The next time you burn, call Rob and he'll say, "How old are you and what's your birthday?"<n>and then you just hang up and it will go away.<n>He does, he says something; it's very weird.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt
Anyway, so Dad, Dad made this convertible hearse and he used to take all the neighborhood kids, and there was like ten of us.<n>He put us all in the hearse and we would go hooker hunting downtown.<n>Hooker what?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt
!<n>So, we'd go downtown and go, "There's one!"<n>But see, and really it was just to go to Dairy Queen, `cause you had to go downtown to go to Dairy Queen, and he was really taking us all for ice cream<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt
So, we'd go downtown and go, "There's one!"<n>But see, and really it was just to go to Dairy Queen, `cause you had to go downtown to go to Dairy Queen, and he was really taking us all for ice cream<n>.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt
.<n>And so, the kids would come over and go, "Phil can we go hooker hunting?"<n>We'd do that and, um, that's my dad, Jesus!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt
so I was a pretty lazy child when it came down to cleaning up and cooking.<n>So one night my mother asked me to go inside and wash the dishes.<n>Naturally, I start crying, and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me, either my stomach, or that I had a headache, or something was wrong with my leg.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
Once upon a time there was this little girl and her family.<n>And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up, wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table.<n>And her little girl just complained, "I don't want to wash the dishes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
The little girl disappointed her mother so badly, but her mother said, "How in the world am I ever going to get her to wash these dishes?"<n>So she said, "Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you."<n>So the little girl just said, "OK I'll go in there and wash the dishes."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
So she said, "Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you."<n>So the little girl just said, "OK I'll go in there and wash the dishes."<n>And she was in there stomping and crying and mad and taking all her good time.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
That was my dream, to teach school.<n>As I told you, in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this.<n>Uh, while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot and she said, "Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward, on your grant to go to college."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
As I told you, in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this.<n>Uh, while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot and she said, "Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward, on your grant to go to college."<n>So she said, "Go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we, you know, can follow through with applying for a grant, scholarship grant for you."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
So she said, "Go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we, you know, can follow through with applying for a grant, scholarship grant for you."<n>So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said, "Baby, I really want you to go to college.<n>It's always been my dream that my children all go to school.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said, "Baby, I really want you to go to college.<n>It's always been my dream that my children all go to school.<n>But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
It's always been my dream that my children all go to school.<n>But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money."<n>At that time my dad was in prison at the time, so it made it really hard for my mom.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
I sat there and I cried but I tried to be as understanding as possible because I knew my mother struggled really hard to even keep food on the table for us.<n>So I never got a chance to go to school.<n>Did anybody?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
I was really afraid.<n>But he told me to go ahead and try it, so I took the entrance test, and they accepted me into at the school, and I took some courses there.<n>After a while, the principal said, "I would like for you to bring me your, um, transcript so I can see what your grades are like."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
Well I didn't like writing at the time<n>but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper.<n>And I went to, um, one of my staff members and I asked her if she would proofread it, and she thought it was an excellent paper.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
I just got to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never went back.<n>But I love what I do and, uh, anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I go for it so.<n>How many different schools did you teach at?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
And my aunts were all visiting; my uncles, and the cousins were there also.<n>And one of the aunts, or my mother, said, "Let's go see Robin Hood."<n>Well, Robin Hood had been, they moved many years ago from there, uh, so we all piled into the car and went to see Robin Hood.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt
Then suddenly, the thought came.<n>The sights and the sounds of the world could go on forever, But the place of my childhood dreams could never again feel the same inside.<n>It's beautiful.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt
Um, when they were still remodeling the house, it was Christmastime, and we still lived in the city, the phone rang uh, whether it did or it didn't, my father said it did.<n>And we went, uh, he said that we had to go out to the farm because, uh, someone had left the light on in the barn.<n>So we piled into the car, Christmas Eve, and it was snowing, so beautiful.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt
My father was in the hospital at the time, and he died a month later.<n>So my mother then left our home, and, uh, didn't have a home to go to, and built a home in the city, then, uh, was happy there, although she was lonely, I'm sure.<n>And, uh, created another garden, but was never the same thing.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt
We walked down to the creek and the watercress was still growing in the creek as it had as I grew up.<n>Uh, it was interesting that the man was sensitive as we are, and he said that they would go to certain corners of the fields on the property that was sixty-seven acres and, you could still feel Mr. McGovern's presence.<n>And, uh, I liked that<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt
Um.<n>But we would go home and my mother would always reassure us that uh, it's OK to be different.<n>It's what is in your heart that matters.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
Uh, went around with, not so much a chip on my shoulder, just, uh, an inferiority complex and didn't realize until I got older that I was very much proud to be Japanese.<n>And uh, got to visit Japan a couple of times, and realized that's the best thing God could have given me was to be different because I'm able to help other people go through the same situation.<n>Um--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
Hum.<n>Did she ever go back to Japan?<n>She went back twice.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
And we feel like travel is one of the best things you can give your children.<n>Money, clothes and all that can go away but travel is in your memories and that when I'm dead and gone I want them to remember that<n>.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
We would think "Oh yeah, right, you were rich."<n>And then when I did go over to Japan, I did see what she was talking about and really felt guilty that we didn't believe her, totally believe her, that, that she had all this, but um, according to Japanese standards, uh, they are just very wealthy.<n>And then they come here and they look at my house<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
It was.<n>I mean, to go from there to, wow--<n>She was pretty much treated like a princess, pretty much, I mean they catered to her family, they adopted children--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
Huh?<n>So she can go over there and teach English in Japan.<n>And her junior year in college, she is at Furman University, her junior year she plans to go over there and spend the whole year, studying in Japan.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
So she can go over there and teach English in Japan.<n>And her junior year in college, she is at Furman University, her junior year she plans to go over there and spend the whole year, studying in Japan.<n>So I really feel like she's doing everything I wished I could have done<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
And of course one of the things I remember most was going out to the Farmhouse which was our first official, unofficial date.<n>And by our first official, unofficial date, should I go into that, too?<n>Yeah.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
kind of a long distance relationship!<n>And my, um, fraternity was having a cocktail and I, of course, needed someone to go with since I didn't have a, uh, girlfriend at the time.<n>And all my friends said, "Why don't you ask Kristi?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
If you talked to him, it was like pulling teeth sometimes, but he would do anything in the world for you.<n>Um, he would always go the extra mile, he just didn't do it with words, he did it with actions.<n>Did you ever remember him playing, was he a sports guy?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
Not really, hmm, he grew up on a farm and, you know, playing sports was, um, and he was so much older that I was, he wasn't really in the best of health when I was growing up.<n>Um, of course, we would go up there every Sunday for Sunday lunch and, uh, he would get out in the yard with us and watch us climb trees and throw rocks and play, but he never really participated because he was 70 years older, you know, 70 years older than I was.<n>So your grandpa was fairly old when you were born?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
And she used to demonstrate that for me, too.<n>We would go out and we would play horse and she would kick my butt because she had that hook shot that nobody else could do!<n>In her high heel shoes!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
Um, so, uh, but what, but actually, my move was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me, oddly enough, um,<n>because when I moved, um, I met like, you know, close friends that, actually, now I go to college with and who I was a roommate with for a year or so.<n>Um, so even though it was kind of a scary experience being uprooted from everything you knew, um, it gave me the chance to see that change is good and that, um, seeing a different part of, you know, just different parts of the same town, it's still very beneficial because it gave me the chance to realize how to adapt to different situations, into a different environment, relatively quickly.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt
Absolutely!<n>I wouldn't trade that experience for the world because there are too many people that I know who are very sheltered from not only new experiences, from like new ideas and new situations, and so I think it's kind of a blessing that I had the chance to go through this in the kind of, um, be the new kid and see what it was like to be the outsider and to not be in the in crowd, you know.<n>Because, I mean, I think a lot of people who have never been on the outside don't understand what it's like to be kind of the kid that's, you know, not "Mr. Popularity," you know?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt
Not really because I was, I think I was too young when they told me that, I don't exactly remember.<n>But, like my mother's mother, my grandmother she like told us about how when she was very young and her mother die, so she had to go and work and help her family.<n>And from when you were little do you remember somebody telling stories, other stories?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaCaroline.txt
before we went to bed.<n>But if it was, like too late already well, we didn't listen to them, we couldn't, she didn't tell them to us, because we had to go to bed, but whenever she had time she would tell us.<n>Do you remember how your bedroom used to look when you were that, that young?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaCaroline.txt
Well mainly almost everybody does and I think I do read like really good.<n>And like usually, like my sister comes up to me and once I'm done reading a book she'll go like, "How can you read that fast?"<n>you know.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaCaroline.txt
Any family, family member.<n>Uh, about their life, and like my grandmother used to tell me about when she lived in Colombia, South America and she used to go really early in the mornings with a group of people to church, with a group of older girls, and they would go on the bus and they would drink hot chocolate and bread every morning on Sundays.<n>And then my dad told me about a time when he climbed up on the window and my grandmother came out and look at him and scared him and he fell down and rolled down the street because it was steep.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaIvonne.txt
My sister when she was like four, she went into the walk-in closet in my parent's bedroom and she put baby powder all over herself and all over the clothes.<n>And also in that same walk-in closet my sister and I, we would go in there and hide from my dad and when he got home from work and we would wait for him to come in and turn on the light and then when he walked in we'd scare him.<n>Because we'd be hiding on the shoes and behind the clothes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaIvonne.txt
They discovered as they ran by each tree in the woods that all the trees were alive and wanting to attach their branches around them.<n>There was nowhere they could go to free themselves of this nightmare except home.<n>So they finally all decided that this was not the thing and they got back into the house, uh, through their window and felt the safe, warm comfort of their beds and vowed never to do that again.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SmithPatricia.txt
Michaela would say, "How about it?<n>Can you go to the soccer game on Thursday night?"<n>And I had an evening job and I would say, "Well no I can't go Thursday."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
Can you go to the soccer game on Thursday night?"<n>And I had an evening job and I would say, "Well no I can't go Thursday."<n>So then a few more games would go by, um, I could go to the game, but she couldn't go to the game and next time she could go to the game then I couldn't go to the game and she would say, "Well Mr. Speckman wasn't there anyway."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
And I had an evening job and I would say, "Well no I can't go Thursday."<n>So then a few more games would go by, um, I could go to the game, but she couldn't go to the game and next time she could go to the game then I couldn't go to the game and she would say, "Well Mr. Speckman wasn't there anyway."<n>So this fixture in our house became this Mr. Speckman person.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
Ryan came up to me at school and he said, `He called her!<n>I think they're going to go out!<n>' " And apparently another one of the Quail Girls worked at Boston Market and some of the boys who were in Ryan's group crossed the serving line and said, "He called her and he's going to ask her out!"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
So everybody knew before I knew that he called me and was going to ask me out!<n>So Friday came and we were supposed to go out.<n>I came home from work so there was a message and on the voice mail was Shelle, the girl who had this brainstorm to begin with, and she said, "Hi!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
So, um, Michaela was going out and I had instructions to call her as soon as I got home, to beep her as soon as I got home so we could discuss the date.<n>So we went out to dinner at a place where, Mr. Speckman had asked one of his sons' friends where we should go and he said that's where we should go, and so we went there to eat.<n>And the whole evening was talk, the discussion the whole evening was how all the preparation, and all the discussion that was going on with me and the Quail Girls was also going on with John and with all Ryan's friends.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt

But anyway, everybody was quarantined, we could, children had, could not go out of their own yard, they<n>we couldn't go to church, couldn't go to movies, we couldn't go anywhere.<n>We could ride in the car.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
We could ride in the car.<n>I could ride in the car with, with Mother and Daddy, we'd go for a Sunday afternoon drive or something, but, I had nobody to play with.<n>But fortunately, there was a, another only child girl who lived right across the street from us.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
We were just pissed off<n>because we couldn't go play with anybody else or see anybody or anything.<n>That, that's the only time I really, really regretted being an only child.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
What did your parents do during that time, I mean, to make it more fun for you, or--?<n>Oh, bought me lots of coloring books and, uh, Mother made clothes for my baby dolls and uh, we'd, like I said, we'd go for rides, it was a long way out from Fayetteville to Fort Bragg at the point in time, and now there's, you know, they, they're, have the same, uh, boundary, but we'd ride out and listen to, on every Sunday afternoon, the army band had a band concert.<n>Like at South Park.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
What, yeah, what, what would you read?<n>Oh, all the Nancy Drew books, and all the um, I read a lot of sports books about football and baseball, and Mother would go to the library and just bring home a whole stack of them.<n>So I did a lot of reading, and, uh, playing out in the yard, I'd help, when Daddy would come home, I'd help him out in the garden.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
It had, uh, a window in the front, had a front porch, had a window that went up and down in the front, and a window that went up and down in the back.<n>And had shelves and, it was a pretty interesting little playhouse, and I'd go, I kept all my dolls and stuff out there and I'd go out there and play for hours, and all my, friends would come over and we'd have such fun, and we'd had a couple of little rocking chairs and we sat out on the front porch.<n>Oh, that's sweet.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
Uh-huh.<n>--and a bathroom between the sitting room and the kitchen was a bathroom and also the door to the stairs to go down to the basement, because we had a coal-fired furnace.<n>And then upstairs there were two huge rooms, one on either side of the house and a bath at the top of the stairs.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
I discovered boys and I didn't want to play the piano as much any more!<n>Because Daddy had delusions that I would even go to Juilliard or Eastman School of Music.<n>But hormones just kind of--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
And here was Lucille from the big city of Richmond--<n>--Who wore high heels and stocking with the black seams up the back, and hats and had jewelry to go with every outfit and all that sort of thing.<n>So, I mean, she just really swept daddy off his feet!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
Um, I couldn't, um, help like bail the hay, pick up the hay, do anything because I was so small, so my mom and my dad and my older sister could, um, help collect the hay so my job became driving the truck and I could reach the pedals.<n>I was tall enough to reach the pedals but my dad taught me how and I would get in that truck and drive around from point to point while they picked up the hay and put it in the truck and I'd drive the truck around and wherever it needed to go and they'd store the hay.<n>So yeah, I learned how to drive at a very early age and needless to say my first car was a straight drive and no one, um, in that town really waited until they were 15 or 16 to drive.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt
Over there it was another field that was fenced in and I don't think there were any animals over there, but it was a fenced in filed as well.<n>So I parked this tractor at the top of our driveway, and I go in to eat dinner.<n>So we eat and, I don't know, it probably takes about an hour, and I go back out.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt
So I parked this tractor at the top of our driveway, and I go in to eat dinner.<n>So we eat and, I don't know, it probably takes about an hour, and I go back out.<n>I want to ride the tractor.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt
I want to ride the tractor.<n>We go back outside for some reason and it wasn't there.<n>And I don't have a clue as to what happened to it and I yell for my dad and we go out there and we start looking and we see trail marks all the way down the driveway through our field and then there is the tractor on the other side of the road in the fence.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt
We go back outside for some reason and it wasn't there.<n>And I don't have a clue as to what happened to it and I yell for my dad and we go out there and we start looking and we see trail marks all the way down the driveway through our field and then there is the tractor on the other side of the road in the fence.<n>So guess what happened, I being the smart little, what, six year old that I was, decided that I forgot or didn't remember correctly that I had put the tractor in park and or in gear and not in neutral.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt
So he was quite rambunctious, so he used to always tell us stories about things he did as a kid.<n>First of all, even though he was capable of, uh, going to school and doing his schoolwork, he chose not to and he would always, um, what you call play hooky, and on those days when we wouldn't go to school he would always come up with some kind of tricks, and one of the things I remember him saying that he did and actually since the time this time I had other people confirm that, uh, this is true that he would take a pocketbook, one of his mom's pocketbooks, and empty it out and tie it a string to the handle and he'd put it in the middle of the road and he and his buddy would let the string be long enough to where they could hide in the bushes and still have the string attached and then they'd wait for a car to drive by and there would always be a car to come by because, of course, this was in the country.<n>And a car comes by and sees see a pocketbook they think, you know, we're going to pick this up and do one of two things.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt
And a car comes by and sees see a pocketbook they think, you know, we're going to pick this up and do one of two things.<n>Their going to either take it, which what's more likely is that they're going to look because everybody knows everybody so they pick it up, or they get out of their car and they go to pick it up.<n>Of course, as soon as they pick it up my dad and his friend just would jerk that pocketbook.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt
Uh-huh.<n>They would go into separate doors.<n>The men would drop off the women in there from their cars, they would go and park and they would eventually walk together, and, of course, the women would walk behind the man.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_YoussefJoseph.txt
They would go into separate doors.<n>The men would drop off the women in there from their cars, they would go and park and they would eventually walk together, and, of course, the women would walk behind the man.<n>Now when they were to go pick up, you know, at the end of the night, the, uh, women would stand in the corner and the man would go get the cars.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_YoussefJoseph.txt
The men would drop off the women in there from their cars, they would go and park and they would eventually walk together, and, of course, the women would walk behind the man.<n>Now when they were to go pick up, you know, at the end of the night, the, uh, women would stand in the corner and the man would go get the cars.<n>And the men really pretty much had no idea who their wives were because they were covered up.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_YoussefJoseph.txt
Now he came back so he's a little out of touch.<n>Um, now we're going to go onto education.<n>And, of course, my dad was, was very strict on education and education was very important for anybody in the Middle East, and of course nowadays anybody in the United States.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_YoussefJoseph.txt
You had to know your education.<n>You had to go to school.<n>My dad told me a lot of times when he was a TA in college he had to proctor an exam.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_YoussefJoseph.txt
How very different it was in Egypt as opposed to here.<n>One test determines whether what college you got to what profession you go into.<n>There are two exams that you will take in your life in your junior year of high school and then in your senior year.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_YoussefJoseph.txt
And what percentile you get determines what college you can get into because college in Egypt is free.<n>So, uh, last time I heard, if you made a 94 or higher on a 100 point, this 100 point exam, you can go into an engineering school.<n>But you couldn't go anything higher than that, not doctorate.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_YoussefJoseph.txt

yes<n>my mother excuse me go ahead<n>yeah well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthened for our family was rather than have one child make that decision<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2005-ms98-a-trans.txt
from what i've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up and that we won't be polluting the air i'm sure we have to have<n>uh permits you know for that place and that there's you know limits as to what we can uh let you know go into the air<n>yeah it's uh having uh uh well well i work in too i work in environmentals uh projects right now and so the Sherman deal is uh uh uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2006-ms98-a-trans.txt

you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area and um<n>certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the Sherman facility than um just letting it go in the ground because eventually you know it it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area<n>it still only in time starts to leak out<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2006-ms98-a-trans.txt

and<n>yep we did that too and the children where um when in fact when my youngest was about two we decided to get out of the city and go to the country<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2152-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>you know it the city itself is great but i mean you go in the in the uh car for a drive and you could see nothing for miles and miles and miles<n>we came back when they were teenagers<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2152-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah<n>i mean they just go and buy it you know<n>yeah well kids nowadays they want to start out with a<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2152-ms98-a-trans.txt
but there are a few companies here in Dallas that do<n>yeah i think that's great because i mean you know you you it's less guilt you feel knowing that you have to leave them everyday if you can go in and see them for ten or fifteen minutes around a lunch hour or<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2152-ms98-a-trans.txt
i just<n>i have to question how worthwhile it is to go to a school that uh really isn't uh that well known for their academics<n>hey i'm headed there<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
i took a couple of semesters of graduate school there myself<n>well they have the master of liberal arts there and so i thought i would go and do that<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>it's not the i i'm not into the Bohemian thing you know were i waitress during at night and go to school during the day<n>yeah  i was just making making a point that some schools develop certain reputations and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah  i was just making making a point that some schools develop certain reputations and<n>no i i agree  but but it's like oh you offer this degree okay i'll go<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's true<n>going back full-time i think is is the way to go<n>oh it it would be wonderful<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
i'd recommend that if if someone was trying to choose a college that they they get uh as much information on the schools as they can as far as what curriculums they offer and uh how reputable they are and what kind of reputation they have in the country<n>and uh go from there<n>the rest of it's just personal preference whether you like the mascot or not or whether it's close by<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah that was a good thing to look out for<n>i looked into going to Marquette also and had a chance to get a scholarship there but it would have only covered uh about a quarter of the cost of the first uh year which uh wasn't enough of a motivation to uh to go there to commit to to four years<n>well we're still writing checks for the loans for Notre Dame<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>i know a lot of people that did most couldn't afford to to go to a movie<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt
because you know we don't listen to the radio at work at all<n>so i don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything<n>oh i'm with you i have to check T News every everyday<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2154-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>but um i like the choices you have now where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some basically have a independent lifestyle but assisted care<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2155-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and then if things deteriorate they can go to a second level which is<n>you know like where they prepare their meals for them and and they still live somewhat independently but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals and then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level which is full care<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2155-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and i have known you know people close to me that have been in all three and i have seen them like go from where they're in an apartment building they we call it um<n>well we have high rises and it's just for elderly people you know or most of most of one of their spouses has already passed away<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2155-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and it's it's really nice to go and see them you know where they can still get around and everything and they still you know do their own thing<n>but it's it's really nice to see them because i mean sometimes like i had a great aunt she lived with us for um three months and because she's starting to get Alzheimer's disease<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2155-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>like you're saying and the programs that they have where where some of them will have dances once a week and some of them sponsor different crafts and they go to the arboretum to see things and they make sure that if they want to go to church there's a bus there<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2155-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>but i think before i like you i don't think you i don't think it's right to just put someone in it i think they would have to agree to go in it<n>yes unless they're at a point where they're mentally incapacitated<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2155-ms98-a-trans.txt

in fact i think they're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback i haven't uh i haven't kept up with it lately but i remember reading something<n>a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody but it wasn't anybody i'd really heard of<n>but i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that uh Aikman's back in practicing doing real real well um who is it Michael Irvin<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2157-ms98-a-trans.txt

i didn't really think about that i just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper<n>but not that i'll ever go i hadn't been to a Cowboys game last time last time i went to the Cowboys game was during that um NFL strike or the when they had the scab team teams in there and it was the uh Dallas and Washington Redskins game<n>and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because a lot of those doctors have season tickets and they um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2157-ms98-a-trans.txt
if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else so my dad i went with my dad to a game that one time but that wasn't a real you know it was it was the scab teams it was kind of<n>you know it was kind of different i guess and before that it's been quite a few years i've been wanting to go to a game i just never never have gotten around to it<n>so maybe this year<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2157-ms98-a-trans.txt

well see the problem is is that um<n>what happens is as that you're uh you know as you go from the country to a city crime always increases right because in the country people still respect uh the property of other people<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2160-ms98-a-trans.txt
now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities and they wish to get the same thing they say why can't we have the same things that these other people have<n>and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs and what we have to do is we have to go there get some stuff steal it and then you know  resell it<n>it's easy you said the magic word there drugs<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2160-ms98-a-trans.txt
it doesn't have to do i mean the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere<n>right and like let's say you're you you go you know you're driving out and you're driving back home and it's late at night and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2160-ms98-a-trans.txt

sure<n>you know that is another thing that you know we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time we buy a car we're not just going to go to Toyota of Irving you know we're going to go to somebody that we know we're going to take someone with us older and we didn't do any of those things<n>somebody you trust you know there are so many rip-off artists here in this town it's it's uh it's really a sin it really is<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2300-ms98-a-trans.txt

the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know how<n>is this open and shut you know like you were saying or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened you know a jury like that<n>you know we<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2302-ms98-a-trans.txt
instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you need you and if you want to your lawyer or your your opponent<n>need to go face this group of twenty five or a Judge Wapner like you know that they have on TV and let<n>huh yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2302-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah right that<n>right that's that's a good idea i in the Bible it says uh if you have something against somebody to go to them first<n>and if that doesn't work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them and if that doesn't work to take it to the whole church<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2302-ms98-a-trans.txt
right that's that's a good idea i in the Bible it says uh if you have something against somebody to go to them first<n>and if that doesn't work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them and if that doesn't work to take it to the whole church<n>so that's right off that same kind of principle<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2302-ms98-a-trans.txt

um if your vote won't make a difference so for instance in um the last presidential election i'm sure a lot of people thought oh Bush is going to win either way why bother voting<n>why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter<n>that's right i think that's and and the other side of the coin is um people saying well if i really like the underdog candidate i still think they're not going to win so some are saying Dukakis is certainly not going to win why bother voting for him so<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt
um that's true actually i never thought about that that that's a good reason<n>and i i think the you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news and by time say you get off work and go to vote you feel like it doesn't make any difference<n>that's true that's true<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt
tend not to be registered<n>and they don't register and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today they say well i would<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt
yes<n>just go in and say oh i want to be a juror i can spot a guilty person a mile away<n>oh i just right right there are so many other ways but that one just it defeated me i didn't have any answer for that one that one was just beyond my imagination<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>now if things go the way that that that they are there i think that they'll keep voting but i think they'll wind up like us at some point where people sort of<n>only half of them will end up voting and sort of caring enough to really make a statement so<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt
i've had one idea that i think is is is completely undoable but it but i think it but but i suspect it would work and the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate who you never expect to win<n>to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements so that a large population of of of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else<n>so given a choice between you know so so if you have so if if imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes you know anti you know sort of um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh<n>anti women statements anti Semitic statements anti black statements et cetera et cetera well then i suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just just to spite that person<n>but i suspect that that that would actually never work<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh because the average person doesn't get to see enough of the entire floor to see a play get uh develop develop<n>and so uh uh i don't usually watch them i'll listen to baseball and i'll listen to uh like the Indianapolis Five Hundred i would not go and face all those crowds for anything in the world<n>but you watch it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2306-ms98-a-trans.txt

and um her son which is my father<n>is also elderly and this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years now my father's almost eighty my grandmother's almost ninety seven<n>jeez<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt
and then one her last sister died and it was<n>probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was<n>and plus she was driving my father crazy she went through three housekeepers live-in housekeepers so she's kind of cranky to get along with there's nothing physically wrong with her except she's very very old<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt
um first of all that anyone could let someone live like that but if you have to<n>you know how do you make sure i mean i'm sure when you make your appointment and go by everybody puts on a happy face<n>um you know how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is because once you put someone into there<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt
um the one my grandmother's in is very um hospital like there were some really nice ones here all the a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations<n>um this one is more or less for someone who who's poor and can't go there and my father's is he's no by no means wealthy but he's quite well off<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt
so the the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it's a really trying job<n>i mean i go up twice a week to see my grandmother and i know the staff very well so they couldn't they can't hide anything on you or anything like that but i have heard of really awful conditions<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt
that there's good people in the homes but it's just as it doesn't matter if it is like you say the best place<n>they still don't want to go to these homes and my grandmother's real there i mean she cries every day this has been over a year and she tries to make me feel really guilty but i have to you know<n>i have to put my foot down where where my life begins i mean if that was my mother i would really feel i feel a lot more responsible i would probably take care of my mother i don't really um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt
when my father when something if anything happens to him<n>i don't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i don't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home and hopefully that he he can uh get along with uh<n>in-house help so he he's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will uh be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt
in-house help so he he's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will uh be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day<n>because i think that's the best situation is when you're you get that old and you've been independent your whole life you don't want to go into a home because uh<n>like i say my father's eighty and he's really active he still has his driver's license here i mean you wouldn't believe what he does he actually tows cars<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt
and as the years got on the tow trucks got better there easier and he went out and bought himself a flat bed one so he won't have to do very much work and<n>so someone like that they i really don't want to see them go in a home he's got two little dogs that are his constant companions and he always replaces them you know i've had like<n>over the past thirty years i've had you know about seven or eight different dogs all the time and there all<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i'm and i'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place<n>i mean and of course it's institutional food and everybody hates it and it's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight  it it's really it's bad thing<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>but when they go into the homes they lose weight and like because of the institutional food you know i think it's fine but you know<n>my taste um buds are pretty uh flexible and here they are they're always used to these<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt
the judge decides whether or not they should hear it<n>yeah uh it it it's kind of difficult and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in in jail<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2309-ms98-a-trans.txt
and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them and<n>sure they should have them go out and doing stuff cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state since the state is paying for them they should get some kind of kind of work out of them<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2309-ms98-a-trans.txt

the uh<n>we go we had uh one doe that we'd had<n>her<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2346-ms98-a-trans.txt
with the child care and and with uh pleasing you know your boss on the job so you have added stresses from there and then you still have all the things that um<n>that you need to do at home and and that doesn't change you know just because your your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't uh make those other things go away and the other responsibilities are still important um<n>so um have you have you worked outside also and um feel that it that well how do you feel as far as uh what would be a happy medium or or what would you like to see<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt
well what do you think though um um i don't know i the the<n>one problem i guess i have and maybe why so many women younger women now are choosing to go outside is i feel that in general in this society<n>that being at home is not looked upon as um a job in itself whereas you know you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself but i know when i was working<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>they used to look down on women that were home they'd say oh i bet you go home and you know at least you get out of here at three and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas and i used to be infuriated because they really had no idea<n>oh sure<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt
hum<n>um and i think that one reason that so many younger women feel in uh compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected<n>huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt
that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home and yet by the same token i think some of it is jealousy you you once in a while you hear them say things like<n>i wish i had the choice you know i wish i was the one i would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>but uh i don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads and they have to that kind of job uh to go out there and shovel that tar and<n>and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt
um he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility<n>um if that meant you know for me to be able to uh uh advance or go back to work or whatever i'm kind of more  thank you  i'm kind of more middle<n>of the road i think that when children are small i think it's okay for women to work especially there should be some a lot more part time<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt
it you know it's worked pretty well i haven't really gotten into any major problems without having something formal<n>yeah how about how about uh long term do you have anything uh for as far as as far as savings go for long term<n>well yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt
um<n>but this other it's in the credit union and they and they take it out and it goes in there and at the end of the month but if we want to go on a trip or if something looks good or if we want to go away for a weekend<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>or if we go out for dinner say to a nice restaurant<n>um that'll come out of that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt
rather than put it on a credit card<n>oh that's sort of the way we you know do it or at least certainly for some of those bigger things or maybe one of the appliances breaks down you know and we have to go get something new then we've got that little cushion in there that<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah so it you don't have to really dig into long term or or you know well you can't cash in a CD that's kind of ridiculous um<n>yeah no i never go like to go into those things that are<n>like you say long term that have penalties and all sorts of other things they<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt
um yeah we we took out actually my wife<n>she's the one that ran the budget you know i just brought it home and she had to stretch it out wherever it was going to go but she would allocate so much at at at that time when the kids were growing up  so much went for groceries<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt
and<n>we stuck to that pretty much so uh groceries fluctuated um we didn't go out to eat that often<n>but as times went on the children got older you know and naturally salaries increased um we kind of fell away from it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i do that too<n>so we don't really see anything if if i need something i'll go and you know use the teller machine or if she needs something she'll go and she'll use the teller machine<n>so we don't really um have a lot of cash anymore<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>so you just stick your credit card in there and then it pumps whatever it pumps and it adds it all up and it gives you a ticket and off you go<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>so you don't even have to go in to see the teller anymore<n>works pretty good then<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>to go into public service i think<n>yes all all young Americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2349-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's right i'm not even really sure this point in time you know what what programs are out there<n>yeah and that's the other thing is that  you know instead of making it mandatory they maybe maybe need to publicize it a little bit better and and uh you know go to the schools and<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2349-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>do programs and tell them that we need your help and you know uh uh volunteer for such and such a time and you you have a choice of where you wanna go and and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2349-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah in their own community right<n>yeah and not to have to pull up roots and you know and go somewhere half way around the world or something<n>yeah that's true  most of them probably wouldn't do something like that although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2349-ms98-a-trans.txt
yep that's right<n>you go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience you get them all in the auditorium and you you know give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something and<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2349-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and i think that they could get some results from that because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded but they don't know where to go to to to do anything<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2349-ms98-a-trans.txt
we had a<n>got a chance to to go outside and<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2350-ms98-a-trans.txt

it's it's it's so easy anyway for everybody to just kind of become a yes man and get carried up along with the emotions and so if there's somebody who's strong enough to stand up with a specific doubt<n>i would a whole lot rather go through the expense of another trial because of a hung jury than that a justice not be meted out correctly<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2484-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh wanted to find him guilty because he kept saying he did it then we kept saying he did it but the other guy you know yeah we had to convince him that um<n>you know that yes he did it but he wasn't guilty he didn't need to go to jail for doing it that was you know he did it he admitted it that he bit that guys finger but he did it in self defense so you know we just didn't feel that he needed<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2484-ms98-a-trans.txt

oh<n>see that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together than if you all were in your own hotels or something and then every time you wanted to go eat<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2485-ms98-a-trans.txt
and another<n>with somebody you'd probably have to go to out eat or something it would run into a lot of money so<n>yeah but they had that was you know that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2485-ms98-a-trans.txt
that'd be great that'd be really nice<n>yeah but that's uh you know that's the best way i found because whenever you have something where you go and now we had one<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2485-ms98-a-trans.txt

a lot of a lot of people did but it would have to be a good show<n>yeah it's hard to know what the good movies are anymore because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by and<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2499-ms98-a-trans.txt
but you know critically acclaimed oh good grief give me a break<n>that's what i mean there's a lot of reasons why i don't go to movies and primarily i mean i now i'm probably going to going to upset you but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2499-ms98-a-trans.txt
well that's lucky<n>in only a couple of hours usually what we use them for now is to transport between school and and uh the day care center and have them wait there just long enough for me to get off work and go pick them up<n>yeah that's good<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2500-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh once you get over all the other hurdles just the economics of it uh it's not<n>as much of an impact to stay home as it were if you figure in what it would cost you to go back to work and you know the<n>right oh right that's exactly what it was with us it was just it was uh we all we had to do was we pay off a vehicle early<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2500-ms98-a-trans.txt
wow<n>we can go north to two of them or south to three of them or just over west a little bit further and there's two more over there there's just all around us but and we've been to everyone of them over the time<n>well that's lucky<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2500-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and that she does that on Thursdays and then occasional Saturday's and i can take off on those Thursday's and be home in time to for her to go off to work and it's cheaper for me to do that and take my vacation even if i uh<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2500-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and our house is not but it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap and it's just a hassle to go do it so i'm looking for the easy way out and uh<n>yeah i know did is it easy to find painters uh painters to do this for you<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2501-ms98-a-trans.txt
but but see there but i don't agree with that because the Catholic religion as far as through the ages has been the rule so to speak<n>you know they are the ones that set the rules set a lot of the rules and they are the ones that do keep the people down i mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're<n>yet they're expected to bow down to it i think that keeps people in a sort of line you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2502-ms98-a-trans.txt
however getting a little old and things are starting to fail<n>um i i live alone now and she stays in the house all day while i go to work  and uh she's been holding herself pretty well<n>the uh up until uh you know recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is  and uh i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2503-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's my buzzer at the door<n>oh okay i'll let you go<n>okay thank you<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2503-ms98-a-trans.txt
i think it's somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference<n>and they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked you know and so they figure why go out and vote you know they're going to do what they want to do they're corrupt anyway<n>well<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i think one of the good ways of solving that is to like everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party and uh you know like in communities<n>and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something i mean that's the only thing that i can figure out because<n>i've heard so many people say well i'm not going on voting on that one you know i i'm going to go fishing today or it won't make any difference if if i don't vote  and i think it does we vote every time<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt
and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something i mean that's the only thing that i can figure out because<n>i've heard so many people say well i'm not going on voting on that one you know i i'm going to go fishing today or it won't make any difference if if i don't vote  and i think it does we vote every time<n>well it uh there's no question it does make a difference uh so far as having a party and then all voting uh when you have different precincts you would have to have a party in every precinct<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum sure right<n>and that's the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party okay we're going to have a block party everybody's going to get together we're going to discuss the different issues and stuff and then we're going to go and vote you know we're going to go vote like<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and um i know my husband now we go vote every time i don't care how<n>small the ballot is i mean if there's one thing if there's one issue because the way i feel is if i don't vote then i don't have any reason to gripe<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt
to complain about it right right<n>right and i hear so many people saying well i wish this would change i wish that and you know but they didn't go vote<n>that's right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt
right down in the first grade uh and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first second or third grade so that the children<n>develop good learning patterns and have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning uh and not wait until they're in high school and then it's too late to try to change them around at that point<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2504-ms98-a-trans.txt

all right what do you think about it like well you can go first<n>well uh i guess uh i hadn't hadn't had a lot of time to think about voters but uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>really i think that that's a big part of it i think that's probably the root and then also that added with all the pressures on the American family today it's a real it's a real pain for us to go vote i mean<n>huh yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
huh yeah<n>i remember the last time that we had to go vote it was like man just to get up there and do it was major effort you know<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and we ran in there it was like right at seven and my husband had worked late and i was going to go we wanted to go together to do it and take our son but it was like we ran in and whew we were the last people in there<n>and i thought you know Kyle gets off usually about oh by five but we live in Tarrant County and he drives from Dallas so you know it's a drive but he still had a lot more cushion to be able to go vote a lot easier than most people you know what i mean<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
and we ran in there it was like right at seven and my husband had worked late and i was going to go we wanted to go together to do it and take our son but it was like we ran in and whew we were the last people in there<n>and i thought you know Kyle gets off usually about oh by five but we live in Tarrant County and he drives from Dallas so you know it's a drive but he still had a lot more cushion to be able to go vote a lot easier than most people you know what i mean<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
and that it's probably not going to end anytime soon the pressure you know to work and just the pressure it puts on the American family<n>and um i  i thought about that and i said yeah that's funny you hardly have time to go vote for this Congressman because you know women are expected to do so much now and i just kind of laughed and i thought God i never thought of it like that you know<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i think that's that's a good observation and and true yes uh<n>yeah but i agree too with what everything you said but i think the two go and then you put those two things together and you're going to have you know no one going to vote but then um i don't know disillusion what's the solution<n>yeah oh what's the solution huh start over again  you know that's we've the people have talked you know about having about redoing the Constitution completely or changing the government a little you know to some extent<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
you<n>we don't have we don't have a little child but i know that when you go in a restaurant we had some foster twins and<n>it was last year and it wasn't through the state but boy howdy man these kids needed a whipping sometimes not to be beaten not to be abused but to firmly be told you are not going to do that and you are not going to spit in my face i said no<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
and if you do that this is going to be the consequence but it you couldn't do that even through the state even the mother it wasn't through the state but even though um the mother really would given approval but because of the situation we just didn't think it was<n>wisdom you know you go in a restaurant and they start spitting their food out at the table now come on but you know you couldn't do really a lot because of the state's control so that's that's a good idea there too i like that but<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt
but that's exactly the you know the way it was and of course twenty five years ago you could you could uh you could<n>you could go in the bathroom at Luby's and take care of it<n>yeah yeah you could could uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2573-ms98-a-trans.txt

that's true<n>but you know i i i think that i think or at least i hope that they understood that's what was going to happen now you can't go from a a communist economy to a democratic one and expect things to be great overnight<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2574-ms98-a-trans.txt

i don't and i don't understand the reasoning for it i really don't it it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money<n>then they should return something to the public i mean if nothing else go out along an interstate and pick up garbage<n>that's exactly what they were trying to get them to do<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2575-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah<n>and and the Dodgers i guess what surprised me most about the Dodgers was letting uh Valenzuela go<n>yeah i don't know he's getting old i think they got their money their money's worth out of him though<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2606-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh i think that's pretty<n>that looks that was fairly comfortable yeah and it was why and Nolan Ryan pitched the first seven innings today and he gave up three runs in first inning and i said oh my God here we go again you know you know with two outs walk walk home run b ang we're down three to nothing<n>pretty good guess<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2606-ms98-a-trans.txt
um<n>wow often how often do you go out to the baseball park<n>uh well it different times different years because<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2606-ms98-a-trans.txt
because my uh<n>uh my job takes me out of the country a lot and it always seems to be during the summer uh last year we got to go out maybe about a dozen times which is the most we've ever gone out and we had about uh the Rangers<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2606-ms98-a-trans.txt
wow<n>and we happen to go out there on win night and uh uh they and they got hot then and i'm not sure they put the prices up a dollar a ticket this year we may have to go less but<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2606-ms98-a-trans.txt
um<n>and uh the the park holds about forty thousand people and uh i never go on a night when they think there's going to be forty thousand there's just too big crowds i i pick the games where they don't<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2606-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>yeah i love that movie i absolutely love that and i guess the players uh you know the class A salaries are are really uh not anything a guy can live on too much so i guess they've got to go out and find rooming houses and<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2606-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>yeah and uh uh the other thing is that that's really hard but of course you recognize the minor league team exists for the purpose of the major league team and the problem we always had in triple A is you want to see the guys go good but then when they go good you know you're going to lose them<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2606-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and and and you've immediately uh now you got you you go out to the ball park and your favorite player is not there anymore and you say you've got you've got to learn his replacement but do you get any local uh do they broadcast games locally or televise them locally<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2606-ms98-a-trans.txt
so you you've pretty much got to the ball park uh uh to figure out but<n>yeah but it's i mean you could you the game could be at seven thirty at seven fifteen and you could say hey let's go to the game and you'll get a seat<n>yeah but yeah yeah uh uh there's probably that's pretty neat because i don't imagine Raleigh's so big that you have big traffic jams going one way or the other<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2606-ms98-a-trans.txt
okay<n>do you want to go first<n>you can go first or i will<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2608-ms98-a-trans.txt

you can go first or i will<n>well you go ahead<n>okay<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2608-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and in a like a oh what do you call it like Pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2608-ms98-a-trans.txt
i would love to<n>yeah you ought to come down um you don't even have to go all the way to New Orleans you know if you want to really get some good food<n>i<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2608-ms98-a-trans.txt
really<n>i mean you don't have to go that far south<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2608-ms98-a-trans.txt
but uh<n>of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as i'm concerned and fact is we're going to take a vacation this year we're going to go to New Orleans again and uh<n>is that right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2608-ms98-a-trans.txt
we're only going down there for the food though<n>now where where do you go when you go there uh right on Basin Street and those places<n>uh yeah we go to the the French Quarters and stuff like that and uh i have some friends that live down there<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2608-ms98-a-trans.txt
now where where do you go when you go there uh right on Basin Street and those places<n>uh yeah we go to the the French Quarters and stuff like that and uh i have some friends that live down there<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2608-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and so usually we go to we don't go to the tourist ones we go to the ones that they tell us to go to you know<n>oh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2608-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh that's nice<n>and uh usually if you can find somebody of course now when you go down there you know i mean they've got just there's no where you can miss<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2608-ms98-a-trans.txt
or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have i don't know the right to write your<n>maybe it should go with a drivers license<n>yeah that's see that's an example of a right not a not a actually that's considered a privilege not a right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2609-ms98-a-trans.txt
and they give you these measurements like forty two and three eighths inches<n>and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths uh<n>yeah and it's i forget how many millimeters so you used the metric<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2610-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah and it's i forget how many millimeters so you used the metric<n>well no what we did was wind up using and you just go you just go down and and you get out the the so many inches and and we just marked a little bit less than that<n>uh which is somewhat awkward but had it been millimeters you could have done i think what's interesting the way engineering people do is they they in essence have gotten around it by by listing uh decimal inches<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2610-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i've had motorcycles Japanese motorcycles for years and years and the metric system comes easy to me<n>i think it's interesting you went you know when you you go out there and you're looking for a wrench and you want the next size larger i've got i inherited some some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds<n>but my<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2610-ms98-a-trans.txt
well now that one's fairly easy because that's probably slightly under half an inch but some of them like like twenty seven and and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that that uh don't translate<n>yeah yeah transfer yeah to go from from eighths to sixteenths to uh thirty seconds and remember where it falls it<n>yeah and and you've got to go over there and try it and i suppose you know i need a larger one i need a smaller one i mean obviously you can look at it and say well<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2610-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah yeah transfer yeah to go from from eighths to sixteenths to uh thirty seconds and remember where it falls it<n>yeah and and you've got to go over there and try it and i suppose you know i need a larger one i need a smaller one i mean obviously you can look at it and say well<n>anyway i think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't i don't know do you do you drink adult beverages<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2610-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh<n>you go from the uh water pump up to the<n>radiator and on the<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2610-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and you go to look at it and you don't know which set to reach in American or metric<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2610-ms98-a-trans.txt
it it can be annoying and my other concern concern is<n>is the American government going to force us to go<n>oh i think i don't think so i i think that that uh i think they've now just taken the attitude that well if it happens if it because it there a lot of things that that uh um like sports you know it's a hundred meter<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2610-ms98-a-trans.txt
it's all metric all ready<n>yeah and and so um but but when you go to order a drink um you know well you say they they i don't know it's uh<n>and what will a shot be will a shot be an ounce<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2610-ms98-a-trans.txt
and what will a shot be will a shot be an ounce<n>i don't know and and but you know when you go to the store and and you're trying to figure you know well this box is is uh is is twelve ounces and and this one's uh uh three pounds um and you<n>and the other one's<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2610-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>yeah and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke smoke area and you don't smoke you almost strangle<n>oh really do you smoke<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2611-ms98-a-trans.txt
because there is so much smoke in the air<n>yeah areas the smoking area you know it's closed in and if you don't if you don't smoke and you go in there that everybody that goes in there smokes so it's full of smoke when when you go in there<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2611-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah it's it's marked up<n>just a little shell to go under a suit you know<n>it is it is really outrageous but uh i mean like whenever i i was growing up and all my mom i never understood this then but i do now but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars or<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2611-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh on the head<n>every every time they go one way the wind is always blowing the other which is<n>well that's true but i suppose it's hard to judge from the eighties because um Reagan was just so overwhelming to them i think they're seeing some of that unraveling these days but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2612-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah uh out of Massachusetts i think<n>yeah i wouldn't mind him too much he's a pretty good guy he's been around and he's he keeps a low profile and doesn't go after the the headlines and stuff<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2612-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>yeah i i would be interested to see if Sam Nunn decides to go this time i i<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2612-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>oh i i guess i didn't hear that i didn't go over it really<n>well i mean that that's what you can infer from it because it it's amazing that it started about two years before the the the run<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2612-ms98-a-trans.txt
i mean obviously it's gotten a lot worse<n>but you know just like you say you go through there and you watch all these trucks and they're just coughing out all kinds of stuff some of them spitting it out so thick you can't even see past it<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2613-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh<n>you know by the plants and the trees and all that good stuff and here we are losing it and now the now it doesn't have any where to go<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2613-ms98-a-trans.txt
i don't know whether i have any real profound thoughts about that i actually was was planning a trip to Latin America and i got warned off by<n>some people they say Peru can't be traveled to and the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth<n>oh really<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2614-ms98-a-trans.txt
i don't know why that is a problem down there and i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too and uh<n>and some people say go to New York but i don't i don't have an answer to the crime rate it's sad that is a sad situation i i'd like to go down to Mexico you know and i keep hearing that you know the government and and the crime rates pretty high too that that is sad<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2614-ms98-a-trans.txt
but uh i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way<n>uh go ahead you you comment on it yeah i'm glad that you're in the business that i know TI's gotten it with their Speak and Spell and everything i've told my wife that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer you wouldn't have to have a keyboard<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2614-ms98-a-trans.txt
i don't know what the the last thing i've done as far as car repairs go is is change oil and filter an and that kind of stuff i haven't gotten really involved in anything<n>uh extensive in car repairs in oh oh probably a year or so i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the water pump on an Oldsmobile<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2615-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i had a similar thing that i've worked on cars ever since i was uh a kid  and that was some time ago but i've gotten to the point where uh the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that uh<n>oh most of the cars i buy i try to buy as simple a car as possible so you know changing the oil changing the spark plugs and most of them now you know you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or<n>yeah i know what you mean<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2615-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh yeah yeah basically that's it<n>the guys average guys can't really go out in the in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs uh<n>yeah i've got uh an eighty four Chevy van that's uh a one ton van with a camper conversion on it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2615-ms98-a-trans.txt
the two little cars i've got now<n>bought a Mitsubishi Mirage here a couple years ago and and it was normally carbureted and it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong and you know changing the plugs and stuff<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2615-ms98-a-trans.txt
finding a taker<n>people or either not or maybe they're burned out or they're through with it anyway let you go thanks for talking<n>yeah well<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2615-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>right then the United States says okay our our oil prices are going to go up and like for example see okay like Lithuania Lithuania right they declared themselves uh an independent country with a president right<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2616-ms98-a-trans.txt
Russia goes in there well the main government in Moscow goes in there and they kick everybody's ass<n>and the United States doesn't go in there and say listen they were uh you know named an independent you know state with a president and everything but we're not going to go into your country<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2616-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>right like their immediate boundaries like you're not going to go you know it's like the Army's not going to go straight into Russia because there you're you're invading their border right but all the other countries you can fight about<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2616-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know and they're not going to do that directly<n>but the thing is is that they they didn't go into into Iraq and say you know because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country you know you can seek  seek asylum here and you can go there but no way are you going to rule ever again<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2616-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>seems like the prices never go down to where they were originally though before the before the increase started<n>well the it it's an advantage you know it's like you're saying okay i can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2616-ms98-a-trans.txt
because well you know it's like other the other independent companies the gas stations you know and they did<n>and uh then the taxes go up and then everybody else loses<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2616-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>we decided the only way we could afford vacations is to go camping<n>oh yeah isn't it great<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2618-ms98-a-trans.txt
so we weren't concerned about it and we just sat and watched it and we explained you know how it did well that night she had a nightmare and she has been terrified of spiders since<n>but we still go up there and we still have a great time<n>well good i'm glad to hear that about the only thing uh i might suggest is<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2618-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh yeah i can appreciate that<n>it's it's uh it's you know getting up to Turner Falls or uh up to Lake Murray is about as far as we've really tried to go in a car we have gone down and uh<n>uh gone down to the New Braunfels uh San well we were headed down to Sea World in San Antonio<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2618-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i<n>well the next time you go across the state line or when you come back in be sure and stop at one of the Texas<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2618-ms98-a-trans.txt
so i i i i i think it's essential that it's done and i think the real trick is to avoid the<n>you know a little more attention to human psychology and whereas people want round numbers and after all the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers so they don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch and so what the exact<n>exactly exactly<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2619-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>well uh uh your you said your family was grown uh all grown up now how about when they were younger did you go camping take them camping<n>that's when we camped the most when i thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2620-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>because uh i it seems like i would go through a period of time where i just uh was really overworked you know and and getting out into nature and relaxing<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2620-ms98-a-trans.txt
or is it always kind of hot<n>well yes uh yes and no i mean um yes in the winter time yes it's it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly but uh there's really no time of the year that you can't go<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2620-ms98-a-trans.txt
okay uh we have not camped a great deal here because uh a good share of the time in the Summer time it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping<n>well it just depends on where you go for instance if you went down to the sea shore it would be wonderful a nice breeze blowing in from the water<n>i guess<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2620-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp and it was so you know pick your own uh blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast  uh also go ahead<n>oh yes yes yes i come i come from up in that area i'm a New Yorker myself<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2620-ms98-a-trans.txt
because<n>yeah it is neat though because there are lots of lakes fairly near by you don't have to go very far<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2620-ms98-a-trans.txt
nothing like the fresh outdoors<n>right i'd always come home just relaxed and uh comfortable and ready to go at it again so it was a neat activity<n>good to talk to you tell me your name again<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2620-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>but uh i think they still have a little i think they're still such a a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential  that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2621-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know especially i would say the receivers when they're in the air and they get tackled<n>uh-huh go ahead<n>they take such a beating<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2621-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah they they're always branded you know as a bunch of outlaws and if their if their<n>you know arrest record won't let able won't let them play anywhere else they seem to go to they seem to go to the Raiders but that just may be you know perceived<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2621-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits<n>right i i think that i i mean i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place<n>you know you you don't see it going to any place where it belongs<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2622-ms98-a-trans.txt
um<n>you know how Congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas<n>when clearly their constituency does doesn't back them up on anything you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2622-ms98-a-trans.txt

oh yes it certainly does and familiarity with the area there's sometimes advantages to moving way off and going to a unknown area but uh there's as many<n>right well for example yeah yeah i i think that's very true because for example uh i'm going to graduate school after i finish here and uh i'm going to go to California<n>to stay in the same area<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2644-ms98-a-trans.txt

um-hum um-hum<n>and just kind of go with the punches<n>sure<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2645-ms98-a-trans.txt
i never found the one that was worth it for me to leave<n>uh-huh well the best thing about it is that you can uh try something if you don't like it shoot move on to something else that's the way i've uh looked at the whole thing here i'll take a chance if i don't like it i'll go someplace else do something different<n>and that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2645-ms98-a-trans.txt
an adventure<n>right there you go<n>that's the way to do it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2645-ms98-a-trans.txt
and maybe i'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i don't get laid off between now and then<n>there you go that's the thing to do<n>that's much funner than doing any kind of job<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2645-ms98-a-trans.txt
dining out seems to be a uh uh something we do off and on<n>through our lives i guess as economics and as kids come and go and uh situations change uh we used to do<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>now even the atmosphere that that we would seek uh when we go out is often more quiet and uh<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
that uh those type of qualities have uh moved into the picture and then there's there's some economic concern but usually it's if if it's going to be a night out it's going to be a a decent meal and<n>and uh fortunately for us there's not a whole lot of places in the immediate area that's totally really expensive you have to go a ways to get to a really<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
places that you went before spur of the moment that might be nice but casual um<n>sometimes it's not worth it to go through the trouble of digging the sitters and everything just to go and so what i have found now that um<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>when we do go out uh as you said you out on the town now when we go out it's it's you want it to be more special<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>you don't want to just uh necessarily run out for you know a one hour and come back i noticed with us it's more when we do go out then we do try to make it something nice maybe a dinner theater or nice restaurant with friends<n>um sometimes lunches when we can do that that's okay too but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
um sometimes lunches when we can do that that's okay too but<n>um it definitely you know it definitely changes is changed we maybe eat in somewhat nicer places now but that's because when we do go<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
um and what i'm finding now is they're finally getting to the age where we're venturing into going again with them<n>and of course when you take them though you're going to go to something like a McDonald's level or maybe a little bit of a family style restaurant<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
i i i tend to agree with you too we look for more um<n>uh quiet type more of a subdued atmosphere now and i think part of that is after you have kids you're you're not as interested in going to uh Georgetown type places where you know you go in every place and there's a lot of uh noise<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
yelling and uh you know you look for different things and that crowd seems to change and you know you're not as much part of it<n>um and you don't there are more decent restaurants moving out to the suburbs you know and that type of thing uh you don't necessarily have to go downtown DC to to find decent restaurants and uh<n>there's a lot that are moderately priced also whether you're in the suburbs or go downtown so there's there's quite a selection in this area<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
um and you don't there are more decent restaurants moving out to the suburbs you know and that type of thing uh you don't necessarily have to go downtown DC to to find decent restaurants and uh<n>there's a lot that are moderately priced also whether you're in the suburbs or go downtown so there's there's quite a selection in this area<n>there's a uh one place that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt

and um not all of them do take reservations either so so you sometimes have to allot yourself uh enough time<n>um you know to go out uh you can't figure on going out and being back in two hours you know<n>um the other thing that's changing here is because of the um the age set here uh a lot mostly people in they're i'd say late twenties to early forties in these neighborhoods that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's one thing to definitely consider<n>uh-huh uh-huh i think uh a lot of a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college a lot of the students that i talked to even here in Waco they go to Baylor um<n>they or they're considering going to Baylor they're also considering going to UT Austin but one of the big<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt

hum<n>people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want<n>yeah i think that is an excellent program i really do i like that and it's it's beneficial to the small towns too because they really really<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt
the Peace Corps itself is really uh uh dying out isn't it<n>i really don't know that much about it you know i i i think of the Peace Corps you know more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when but yeah and don't they go into other countries and stuff<n>it's still in existence<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt
it's still in existence<n>i want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt
i'm wondering if there's another issue here and maybe this is why this has died out<n>can you go into and this wasn't the question but it's it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults<n>can they go in there and can anyone<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt
can you go into and this wasn't the question but it's it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults<n>can they go in there and can anyone<n>go into<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt
can they go in there and can anyone<n>go into<n>well out of the Kurdish community is a little bit of extreme at this time but say i think Bangladesh would have been a good example<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt
and they're just kind of<n>more like a side show than anything else and that's sad but i don't think there's any way you could go uh the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people and i that don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either<n>yeah really<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt
i wonder now in and i've been out of school too long to answer this but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses<n>there probably are you know for but i'm sure that's probably like people that do that are social are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn't really be<n>half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize that it's everybody's responsibility<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt
what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give um<n>more money to these people i mean and that's not really the answer i mean because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that but<n>yeah that's exactly it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah that's exactly it<n>they're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it now come on let's be realistic that's just not realistic<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt
i guess we're getting kind of off the subject here but yeah i mean it's<n>no we're not i don't think i think that's more realistic than going making them go in the Peace Corps<n>true yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah<n>and it kind of has to start from the top and and go clear or from the bottom maybe and go clear up people<n>well i i think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship the people just don't care about what they're doing you know the whole nobody cares nobody's nobody's really paying<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2658-ms98-a-trans.txt

that that's probably one of those ones that you know<n>it's it's on video now i think and it's probably probably worth seeing on video um actually we really enjoyed it but it was it was it was also right along the same lines i mean they they would go ahead and kill themselves for a few three or four minutes to see what happens and<n>yeah it is<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2662-ms98-a-trans.txt

you know so there's and and the moms that work a lot of times just can't help at all and yeah<n>right well i i i believe that the school puts a big demand on the students on the teachers and the students for for the fact that they expect the parents to go out and<n>a lot of times chauffeur or lot of times you know buy a lot of things that might seem unnecessary but i it's unreal on the cost of sending a kid to school because of you know you spend your time voluntary and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh my word<n>and it's an automatic transmission and it's just a regular old everyday go back and forth to work car<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2811-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>the choices i mean you know you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that that's kind of um the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies it was sort of just to um go protest and uh<n>right uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
and restructuring stuff families yeah<n>you know go out and do what they want to do but i think that um society's going to really have to get used to it and they're not quite used to it yet and that's i<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh  yeah<n>what's it like to be twenty three as a woman today i mean when i was twenty three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married um those were the general issues<n>speaking of getting married i was talking to someone yesterday on this on the project and uh uh we were talking about child care and he asked me if i had any kids he was about forty or fifty years old and i said no i'm just twenty and i said no i'm just twenty three<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt

um-hum<n>finally to a point where i mean i don't know why i didn't didn't do it sooner but this is probably typical of the women's movement too the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway if you want to go back to school i'm seriously considering going back to school for law<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah yeah<n>they have to do everything you know sort of i call kind of i call it a chewing syndrome they have to eat real fast they have they have to rapidity of speech they have to just go through everything<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
um but what i was going to say about mothers is uh your mother probably just won't say it but i mean my mother and her sisters are always saying uh to my cousins and i my female cousins<n>you girls are so lucky because quote unquote you have all these choices you know you went to school you can do this you can do that we couldn't do that then and my cousins and i go well why couldn't you  and they<n>right um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
and yeah and i feel<n>and i'm lucky though because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee i don't know what to do i have so much you know not a lot of people but it's depressing too what do you what do you do that you're uh-huh<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
what<n>here's what you should do this is off the topic and these people probably won't  did you go to Baylor by any chance<n>okay<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2812-ms98-a-trans.txt
it was yeah it was uh just to fill a page<n>yeah i mean i just got the feeling that he sort of has a coterie of of students and he says okay go write three chapters on this and he and he kind of he might write some stuff i don't think he writes all his stuff every word i may be wrong<n>yeah you're probably right um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2813-ms98-a-trans.txt
huh<n>but they're very good except i couldn't i just got on their list somehow because at one time i did some research for them and i'm not really sure how one would go about getting this but it's it's excellent<n>uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2813-ms98-a-trans.txt
the color is what you're yeah sometimes after<n>and if you can stand the additional expense which you you'll recoup after a while because it will last forever is the redwood if you'll go with the redwood<n>that's that's what we're doing is just the redwood and we're doing it where they use the screws that are um  they're not nails they're the screws have<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>before he starts doing the construction to go ahead and do the water seal<n>oh and do the water seal floor<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh and do the water seal floor<n>on those and then when he cuts them and puts them together then that'll already be treated and a fast way of doing that if you'll go get a piece of guttering material like a little trough<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt
you would never be able to know it so<n>well that's definitely interesting so here we go with another home project<n>well it it's kind of fun though things like that especially something like that where where you're outside you're not worrying about something inside the house that you can mess up outside you can learn a lot by doing that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt
paper<n>uh paper can go now we bundle that on top of our  and set it out beside our green<n>okay<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2815-ms98-a-trans.txt

well all of our um grocery stores are going to um<n>they have each of one i shop at i go to a Skaggs and Albertson's and a Kroger and they will let you bring in<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2815-ms98-a-trans.txt
with a cloth diaper<n>to use instead of a hanky or or tissue you you know they can could just flat go through three dollars worth of tissue you in a morning you know<n>oh yeah she's just<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2815-ms98-a-trans.txt
no i don't<n>well if you ever get to come here you must put on your list of place to go  is a place called<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2815-ms98-a-trans.txt
so there's a lot of factors involved<n>what is the point at which you would go from home care to institutional care<n>well i think i would in some ways have to decide how much personally you know i was able and willing to handle and how much it would affect you know the rest of my family because i have two small children<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt
and um we don't have a real large house if you had a lot of money and you were able to<n>you know have like a little separate wing or something where i wouldn't have to constantly be having my children you know be quiet and go away and that kind of thing to accommodate an elderly person<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt
um the only people i've seen is my husband's grandmother has been in a nursing home for several years i know that uh there's been a lot of questions from other family members as to whether she's getting enough attention and<n>whether they just kind of let her sit there and roll her over once in a while it it's really tragic to go in those places<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt
the things i brought up you know that i thought were important for my family member<n>it it would really be hard because when we go to visit i'm sure places have you know their best<n>foot forward kind of thing unless you drop in frequently and kind of get the since of what's going on behind the scenes it would really be hard to know it's kind of similar in away to some of the things you look for in going to try and find day care for your kids<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt
so i think that would be great if if you know if i had to choose a place for myself that's definitely why i think that kind of atmosphere would be wonderful even i recall where i was living in the college dormitory as a graduate student<n>i thought how how neat you know that you can have a place where you can you know go down together and have dinner with other people because if your living alone the isolation and the depression and all those other factors should be taken into consideration too<n>so i thought you know they should have dorms for older people they had activities going on all the time and you know it was really a much more comfortable lifestyle i could imagine for an older person so yeah i think that would be great if they had places like that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt
setting you know from what i've seen with my grandmother grandmother who passed i don't know maybe ten or twelve years ago they had her in a setting like that where she was responsible to<n>go to they had dinner in the cafeteria and she had her own little room it wasn't like she didn't have a stove or anything in her own apartment<n>yeah they had their own privacy yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh she was paid very well because they the parents trusted them and they you know had done such a good job<n>so um i can see where someone you know in a position like that in a live in capacity would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the finances to be able to do that<n>well that's true and that's something that we're struggling with now as<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2818-ms98-a-trans.txt
right right right right<n>but you know it's it's funny i did i i had a friend that said you know before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other and she got older she said but you know we never do those things anyway so<n>why  why am i waiting you know it's just the it's just the way your attitude changes and you mature i suppose but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2818-ms98-a-trans.txt
so<n>go ahead i'm on the phone all right<n>okay<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2819-ms98-a-trans.txt
but uh  i haven't talked to him in a while but um<n>yeah he he misses it he used to go back twice or three times a year you know because he missed it sounds like you haven't been back there in a while<n>no i haven't been back in fifteen ten fifteen years<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2819-ms98-a-trans.txt
i don't know i think we ran out of social social changes to talk about so<n>yeah well my my kids are probably needing me to go so<n>okay<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2819-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah yeah um-hum<n>so the only thing i would hate is if i were to go and uh i mean it's kind of the same thing with the lie detector  the lie detector test<n>if you don't have anything to hide you're not going to mind it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2820-ms98-a-trans.txt
then don't<n>then then this'll probably be i mean this isn't really excellent Italian food that sounds terrible to tell you go go somewhere where it's not that great but it's um<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2821-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh yes uh-huh<n>okay well when my husband and i go out we have four children so that makes a difference for us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best<n>oh you're kidding<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2821-ms98-a-trans.txt

well i love them they're good kids<n>that's the way to yeah well we're getting ready to i shouldn't say this on this conversation but it's just on my mind we're getting ready to go overseas to adopt<n>so<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2821-ms98-a-trans.txt
how are they when you have children let alone three or four children<n>you have to be careful if you go to a a restaurant that that really is more adult you know with the atmosphere and everything they if you're like we could probably take our oldest son and our oldest daughter<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2821-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and they know how to act i don't i don't think i'd chance it with my younger ones because they're just too much of a distraction and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing and<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2821-ms98-a-trans.txt
um boy but other than that i don't know we we do our share of pizza eating too<n>but it's more like uh go get it and carry it in because we're too cheap to pay the delivery  and i don't like strange people coming to my door um<n>oh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2821-ms98-a-trans.txt
places<n>uh yeah you have to watch it if you go out to eat that's true<n>yeah that's true but you can always blame it on having children no<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2821-ms98-a-trans.txt

huh<n>but there wasn't a uh real for people such as myself that knew they wanted to go to school and knew they wanted to um go to a fairly competitive undergraduate program it wasn't what i would call a uh a career a academic<n>path preparatory path for college prep um as opposed to suburban schools like Evanston Illinois which has one of the largest  you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2869-ms98-a-trans.txt

so uh<n>they actually they call them externships but they actually the child's um uh they go by forms they don't go by grades and i guess i guess<n>what would be the equivalent of our early high school nine tenth grade they call it the tenth of eleventh form um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2869-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>they actually are forced to take time off and pick an area of study it's proctored it's you know regulated and all that sort of thing um but they actually are supposed to go to the library and do their own thing on a particul ar subject and it doesn't matter what it is<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2869-ms98-a-trans.txt

but it's well respected in this area it's private it's very expensive and just talking to people that go there it is uh<n>you know you you know the professors on a first name basis you go over their house quite often and eat and spend time with them and at the major universities you just don't do that<n>yeah that's<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2899-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know there's thirty thousand people there and there's couple hundred people in each of your class and<n>and i remember one professor wanted to have people over but people were you know just kind of scared to go over and are they going to be called brownnoser when uh so it's just sort of unaccepted you just kind<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2899-ms98-a-trans.txt

can't you put it on a disk and then just edit it<n>if if you need to when you go back<n>right but in some in some cases the with the formatting what i'm talking about is that they would set up they set up a certain um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2991-ms98-a-trans.txt
and and and um<n>and um then when they have to make a change say they want to insert a paragraph they've got to go through the document and reset all the page breaks manually<n>rewrite the whole thing<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2991-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah<n>i think the in the insurance area one of the things that we also got that we didn't have before what we haven't had in about eight years is the card for prescriptions where you go in and just pay a minimal amount for prescriptions<n>and uh we have some that are fairly expensive sixty seventy dollars well now we pay eight dollars for them<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3008-ms98-a-trans.txt

that that extended<n>so did you go there like straight out of high school<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3047-ms98-a-trans.txt

well let's see  i have not you know there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools you know just like you said<n>uh depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford different things like that so i i have not really made up my mind you know whether to encourage them to go different places or<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3047-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i mean i would like to uh you know the uh i i like the school where i went i mean and i would not<n>hesitate at all to uh to encourage her to go there if she wanted to or the school where i got my masters at which which was a different school and uh<n>right right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3047-ms98-a-trans.txt

just the whole idea though of of what we were over there for and uh the very unpopular<n>problems that occurred here the riots and the protests and uh it just didn't seem to go over well with the general public like the last one did uh it it raised it to the forefront of of a lot of our thinking back then so<n>uh i i would tend to say that it was not worth it but then it's easier looking back at at the fact that we virtually lost if you want to call it that it's easy to say well yeah it was not worth it considering the results now had we won and it had been quick<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3048-ms98-a-trans.txt

well see that's the house that we got is small enough so my husband and i because there's just the two of us and the two cats um can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard and we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know<n>see when you have kids you like to be able to send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them but i have been watching these houses go up and i i<n>yeah that's true<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3051-ms98-a-trans.txt

i i really i think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care<n>you know you'd do your research and you would go visit<n>visit right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3052-ms98-a-trans.txt
visit right<n>and uh hopefully they would have they would have it so that you could go there anytime<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3052-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>because if you could not go there anytime then that would make you a little bit right<n>uh suspicious<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3052-ms98-a-trans.txt
so we recycle everything but the<n>paper of the magazines go back to the library and they resell them which i can't imagine who would want like back issue of Newsweek but<n>well<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3053-ms98-a-trans.txt

i think they would generate probably uh one of them would probably generate enough for three cars<n>but that's not and i think it can be resolved if uh if they really let go with the technology that they have at uh at their hand and they haven't released it yet<n>just a minute i'm on the phone<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3063-ms98-a-trans.txt

i think that a lot of it is uh i know that my late husband was simply indifferent he didn't feel like he had any say there was too many people too many  other votes for example uh<n>you know he'd say well look you and i see different sides of the fence if i go vote you'll cancel my vote<n>i said i sure will he said so i just won't vote i said then mine counts because you could cancel mine too<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3076-ms98-a-trans.txt
right uh-huh<n>if i do not feel very strongly about an issue then i see no reason to go vote<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3076-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah it's probably true<n>well of course of course listening to government the instructors you'll find out that everything matters but then you could go crazy worrying about everything<n>well you know they also say that most people vote their local politics that that local is far much more important than uh national issues<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3076-ms98-a-trans.txt
i know i know that in my own uh<n>area of people whom i knew and how they were going to vote they didn't go to vote against uh a politician as they did<n>a little bit later when Nixon was running they went to vote against the less of lesser of the two evils in certain cases<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3076-ms98-a-trans.txt
are you prepared to talk  let me push<n>oh i guess so go by ear<n>let me push one here<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3077-ms98-a-trans.txt

and i there just i don't know i guess as you say you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are and<n>uh-huh i think they should go back i i realize you know that we have uh graduated tax brackets<n>but i think they should still go back and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3077-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh i think they should go back i i realize you know that we have uh graduated tax brackets<n>but i think they should still go back and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy<n>oh yes absolutely yeah because uh it seems like you they still come out okay um you know uh they<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3077-ms98-a-trans.txt
but uh<n>how you want to go ahead and say what you do<n>yeah sure what we uh what we try to do is of course you have to pay your your necessities first right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3079-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>uh that let's say i would save a hundred dollars a month or something that's what would go into savings for instance<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3079-ms98-a-trans.txt
well what we do is we take that ledger and we take that hundred dollars and we break it down into different categories<n>so for instance uh let's say twenty dollars would go to to the cars you know car repair maintenance or whatever another<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3079-ms98-a-trans.txt
so you've already got it there when you've got the<n>right and another twenty dollars would go to our clothes another twenty dollars would go to uh you know kids toys or something you know<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3079-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and uh so that then when we want to spend money on clothes or have the car you know serviced or something like that then we just go to that<n>you know that page on the ledger and say okay you know we have whatever saved like a hundred and twenty dollars for clothes so we can go spend you know whatever how you know up to a hundred twenty dollars<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3079-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh so that then when we want to spend money on clothes or have the car you know serviced or something like that then we just go to that<n>you know that page on the ledger and say okay you know we have whatever saved like a hundred and twenty dollars for clothes so we can go spend you know whatever how you know up to a hundred twenty dollars<n>that's a good idea<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3079-ms98-a-trans.txt
and and it seems to work<n>you don't just go overboard spending too much of the savings on one particular thing<n>right right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3079-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and we try to you know make sure where we go and uh try to catch something on sale or or something like that<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3079-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>so that i've got it ahead of time and i don't have to go out and buy it something not on sale because i've already gotten it on sale<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3079-ms98-a-trans.txt
then when the sale comes around again<n>go ahead and stock up again<n>well that's a good idea yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3079-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>or more you know people people will go beyond what they have no matter what they have if they use credit cards that's one thing we're trying<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3079-ms98-a-trans.txt

do you think that would be<n>i think that i think it would be fair i think if if the company could not provide it all on their own for the for the people that would be using it you know a certain amount of their salary would go to it but it would still probably be cheaper<n>acceptable<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3092-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's right<n>with the company than than having to go<n>with the company helping our if everybody you know pulled their own weight in it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3092-ms98-a-trans.txt

oh<n>but uh it's a pretty nice place you'll need to try to go and and stay there sometime but<n>well we've just<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3093-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>i tend to go more to the educational channels if there's uh something that seems interesting there i just uh as i say don't find the modern sitcom very uh<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3094-ms98-a-trans.txt
i don't know what i do with my time but i certainly don't spend it watching uh TV in the evenings<n>right right well same here usually it's already by the time we get everything done it's uh time to go to bed<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3094-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>well another side of the coin that with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court there are a lot of things that could be settled out of court<n>yes that's true<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3095-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah it's well<n>even even raising boys today is different though because they are expected to do so much more than they used to you know used to be they would just go off to work and come home and you know everything was done and it it's a different world<n>oh sure<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3097-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i used to uh used to have a neighbor in one apartment complex i lived in and she had  at the time her kids were like eleven and nine and five<n>and i used to spend a lot of time with her and her kids we used to go to the pool all the time it was an apartment complex so we used to the pool and<n>you know just kind of play around and do uh water games and you know uh have picnics out there that kind of stuff that was our normal thing we also uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3098-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>it's really good my husband and i rented it and as a matter of fact we kind of like shows like Bambi and everything sometimes we will go to this theater and we are the only adults you know and we spend money  but Milo and Otis is good and i think any<n>the whole family would enjoy that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3098-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know<n>there uh her kids i remember one summer cried all summer long they wanted to go to Six Flags<n>you know and they see these ads on TV uh Six Flags looks wonderful and we took them there and then they were too scared to get on the rides<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3098-ms98-a-trans.txt
they wouldn't get on any of the rides even if they were you know tall enough they did not want to get on any rides<n>and they cried all summer long when are you going to take us to Six Flags i want to go to Six Flags you know they kind of chickened out<n>well i was noticing i have  my husband has a nephew<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3098-ms98-a-trans.txt
who<n>yeah plus when they are that old you know it's not as though they are going to go out and rough and tumble with the kids like a younger parent would<n>right right although i mean we are we are in our late thirties now my husband and i and we are still considering it and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3098-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>but uh i might start to go crazy with it too it is a little i i miss the intellectual stimulation<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3099-ms98-a-trans.txt
maybe if if i needed to work part time like four hours a day i might do that because like you should get enough stimulation from me the rest of the time but uh i just think that you know when there's two year olds running around<n>the whoever is taking care of them the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds and only when the infant screams are they going to go there and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with<n>that's right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3099-ms98-a-trans.txt
but but i think it<n>yeah we're just going to have to see how things work out uh but i'm trying to you know leave her a fair amount even at this young age with her grandparents just to go to a movie and things like that so that she's used to other people taking care of her<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3099-ms98-a-trans.txt
right right that's nice when uh i my i have three grandchildren another one coming in September and i it would if they were<n>where i couldn't get my hands on them i'm afraid i would probably go crazy i you know i i like that but if it you do not have to put them in child care that's<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3099-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>but right and you need to look at when you if you do decide to go with child care you really need to to<n>well if i work part time that might be doable<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3099-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh<n>and you know maybe do some freelance type work from home and so if i go back to work on a part time basis i'm hoping i can leave my daughter with her because her daughter you know again will be a couple<n>oh that would be wonderful<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3099-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh<n>she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day and we could might even be able to do it on a trade off basis that i watch their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever or if she wants an afternoon off even if she wants an afternoon just to work<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3099-ms98-a-trans.txt
i do too<n>really well trained people right and have have some kind of real good program set up so that you when you go you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows CPR or first aid or<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3099-ms98-a-trans.txt
maybe you think ahead somewhat but you don't uh book those facilities yeah<n>right and it depends on their health too i know some people say they never want to go to a nursing home you know where others say well you know put me there if i get that bad you know<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3100-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh they live in a small town uh a hundred and twenty miles northeast of Dallas and uh<n>and so the nursing home there if if they had to go there there would be some of their old friends there you know and it's and rather than in a city where you probably wouldn't know anyone so that would be to their<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3100-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah that is one of the options but uh that is so related to the family situation of the children and<n>uh you know i guess not that it's happened in our case in my family because it well i have seen it in their generation it what you do is first see your parents go through it with their parents<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3100-ms98-a-trans.txt
i've almost been surprised the last three or four years with my friends in the neighborhood as many<n>mothers it's always been mothers have come to live in the home but then maybe they'll have a stroke or something and and then then they'll go to the nursing home but they go to the home first<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3100-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>we didn't i think i'd go nuts<n>oh i know i know i don't have that luxury yet<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3101-ms98-a-trans.txt
for awhile<n>but i'd i mean i'd have to get away from him eventually but another friend of mine has said that he and his wife are going to do that and he said that they're just planning to take their bikes and then go into port every once in a while and<n>say see you later and take off and he said that they thought they could keep their sanity that way<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3101-ms98-a-trans.txt
it's pretty nice it's nice to have it's a good way to get away Kyle is afraid that he doesn't want me to to pull it by myself yet but the way our drive way is there's like a forty five degree turn so i do not think i could get it out even if i wanted to<n>um where do you all where do you all go skiing<n>we go to Lewisville and but it's really nice i mean we've talked about getting the the slip so that if after work if i wanted to go out and play around in the boat i would have plenty of time because now it does not get dark until nine o'clock but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3101-ms98-a-trans.txt
um where do you all where do you all go skiing<n>we go to Lewisville and but it's really nice i mean we've talked about getting the the slip so that if after work if i wanted to go out and play around in the boat i would have plenty of time because now it does not get dark until nine o'clock but<n>oh i know it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3101-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh i know it<n>it's really nice having it in the garage because then if we want to go to Whitney or you know Grapevine or any other place it's just there and we can load up and go<n>yeah that's true<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3101-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh i know it or that time off one of the two<n>yeah really yeah you kind of need need them to go hand in hand i guess<n>yeah it helps it helps<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3101-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah it helps it helps<n>yeah because i mean i there's times you know even our weekends where we don't have time to go and it's sad because you think God you are paying all that money for the boat and it's just sitting there<n>oh i know it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3101-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh i know it<n>so but it's well worth it when we do get to go and hopefully it will be good weather this weekend so we can go<n>man it's supposed to be<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3101-ms98-a-trans.txt
no i just graduated from college yes<n>oh did you where did you go<n>i went to Clarion<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
huh uh<n>would you i mean if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place or<n>um i would want them to make that decision and i would you know uh i pretty much made my decision on my own and my brother older brother likewise<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
is that why you picked the school you did or<n>well i picked it for a couple of reasons it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home so it was far enough away that i was away but yet close enough if i ever wanted to go home i could<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh and that was for tuition and<n>yeah that was for everything and now i did not go out a lot and i did not order out a lot and i you know i did not spend money on myself<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh<n>and then another reason was i was not sure you know i always wanted to go to school for nursing and then at the last minute i changed my mind<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
so<n>but you know i think i think that's most of it personally but that's why i you know with my kids i think that you know i am just going to encourage them to go and i am going to try to help them financially but uh i think you know<n>financially i am there's only so much i can do for them and i will say here's what you have got you can either you know go a couple of years locally and you know then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
but you know i think i think that's most of it personally but that's why i you know with my kids i think that you know i am just going to encourage them to go and i am going to try to help them financially but uh i think you know<n>financially i am there's only so much i can do for them and i will say here's what you have got you can either you know go a couple of years locally and you know then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it but<n>exactly<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>otherwise you can just go for four years you know somewhere and i will try to try to help you<n>but uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and then lets me go and i mean i did not do poorly i finished with a two five that's not that wonderful either<n>uh-huh yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah well see i think<n>you know i have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it and and i guess it depends on the way you are raised too but if you if you grow to expect that you know you kind of go there as sort of a vacation<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>yeah see well i screwed myself up also there was a point in time that i decided that i did not want to in school and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do and i said well i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life you know<n>yeah you are right exactly<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>but i would have really liked to go on uh secondary ed with math education but it was just the fact i was paying for it myself i was not going to put myself behind another year<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>right well my my wife was sort of in the same situation she was she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go for<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3102-ms98-a-trans.txt
sure<n>the one's that uh go along with that they are sure of themselves<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3103-ms98-a-trans.txt
i think it's just i think it's just difficult for men to uh to accept women equally even if they want to they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss  uh dictator dictatorships are real efficient<n>well i guess we would have to go back to the way that the Lord made us and uh<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3103-ms98-a-trans.txt
well that's great<n>no our last daughter she didn't want to go to school she's uh but she's married now they built a home just a couple miles from us and<n>well how did you go about selecting a college then<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
no our last daughter she didn't want to go to school she's uh but she's married now they built a home just a couple miles from us and<n>well how did you go about selecting a college then<n>well we didn't do it right all the time with our first boy we persuaded him to start here and i do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home i think the main thing is to uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
no not necessarily<n>and but like our oldest boy i think he would have he wanted to go to Embrey Ray Riddle and we talked him into going local here first<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>uh it has to do with airplanes and everything which is what his whole life is  and i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally<n>and he would probably be flying is what he would be doing uh but but right now of course he's he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut and they build and rebuild uh jet engines<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
how about the other four other three who went<n>uh the other ones uh the second one she chose we let her go where she wanted to uh we didn't want her to go but she went to Erie to Gannan University uh or Gannan College i'm not sure which it is college i guess<n>uh she went there two years and it was more expensive and she soon realized you know even though she didn't like Clarion she came back and finished at Clarion<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh<n>when they were like in junior high and high school i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>uh yeah they kind of had that they just expected to go Daphne never went she always said she would never go to college<n>she said i i always thought she'd change her mind you know but she didn't and there's nothing wrong with that you know if college isn't for everybody<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
because if they get an education<n>and are willing to go where the jobs are<n>they can make a you know a much better income<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh uh-huh<n>okay did you go to college<n>yes i went uh four years undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln because Lincoln is where where my parents lived and there really<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>there really wasn't a choice i mean the finances uh dictated that you had to go there<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a uh<n>scholarship to go anyplace else i think that i<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>would definitely you know have gone now when i finished there then i got a scholarship to go to the Harvard University in Boston and that was uh i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened i mean i was<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>now my kids i keep saying that uh you know i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3104-ms98-a-trans.txt
there've been several things that have happened where i felt like if i had been involved in it i would have had to<n>to go along with with that being the punishment given to to the people<n>um-hum um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3105-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i i guess my concern is what we're reading especially in Texas right now with them letting out<n>the people out of jail as soon as they're out of prison when they do and then having them go right back and the day they get out they're back in crime and and especially when they're assaulting people and then killing people i mean the man that killed those three sheriff<n>yeah i think that that that that's a really<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3105-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>you know they stay in jail they get of f time for good behavior and stuff and they get released and they go right back and do it again<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3105-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i'd forgotten<n>yeah they're i've i've bought it a couple of times that or one of the other ones like that one you know after reading the front page there will be something that just catches my eye and i'll go ahead and buy it<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3106-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and it's going to be pretty darn expensive and and it was saying you know what to you know how you could go about putting<n>starting to save now<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3106-ms98-a-trans.txt
there we go uh so uh what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary<n>boy i i i don't know that's a that's a a tough one uh uh and it's uh i suppose it's it's<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3107-ms98-a-trans.txt
right i mean uh and and and it turns out that actually uh the benefits they you know that that hundred dollars<n>sort of would would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and and use them and it turns out that i do think they're very they're excellent physicians there so through my wife's HMO we've registered for them as our primary care physicians<n>so we go there anyway so they're they're so if they were to bill which which i believe they don't but if they were to bill the HMO for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing but they're not thank God um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3107-ms98-a-trans.txt

just routine visits uh they will<n>compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors which which uh my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since uh he keeps real busy without having to to uh yeah<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3107-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-huh<n>but because you could go sixty five miles an hour on the<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3190-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and i think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly if they didn't have to you know go into a kitchen<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3191-ms98-a-trans.txt
yes sir<n>so that if she you know if she wants to fix herself something light she can do that but if she wants to go to a meal she can go down the hallway<n>uh to a room where there's a cafeteria and there's other people there and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3191-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>then mother was able to go with people and and enjoy it<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3191-ms98-a-trans.txt
go ahead what do you have to say on the subject<n>well i am a tax preparer myself so i do about five hundred income taxes a year in fact i even do television and radio shows here in the<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3192-ms98-a-trans.txt
and well easily just as you said and i sat down and thought about it and i should be in a pretty good position because i don't have little kids any more that i need<n>sitters for or anything like that if i go to work it would be for our fun money and we realized that how it would distrupt disrupt our<n>travel routine and things like that and my husband gets five weeks vacation and we said it's not worth it i'm not working any more<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3192-ms98-a-trans.txt
so complicated i can do ours in a normal year i have always done our income tax and i've done it with transfers and sale of property<n>but this last time it was so involved that i just threw it all up and said forget it let's go see a CPA well<n>and yet if you went to visit five different CPA's you'd get five different answers<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3192-ms98-a-trans.txt
and yet if you went to visit five different CPA's you'd get five different answers<n>that's what i understand uh this one seemed to do well and uh she did go over our last three or four years and she said i have to compliment you you have excelled she said i cannot find one<n>thing to pull out that you haven't already pulled and i said well i do keep records<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3192-ms98-a-trans.txt
thing to pull out that you haven't already pulled and i said well i do keep records<n>all year long as i go one on twice a month one on<n>i think uh you sound like one of the type of clients i'd love to have<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3192-ms98-a-trans.txt
well that's what she said i went in there and i had all my books and i said now what do you want to know and i keep every single thing as i write the checks twice a month i enter it<n>uh in either donations wherever it goes i do keep good records and so therefore this time i did not like having to go to someone else because i said well i've got all everything<n>but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3192-ms98-a-trans.txt
okay well basically my habits are totally gone i used to exercise quite a bit and now i have a child and and um trying to do go to school back to college again so it's<n>okay<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3193-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>exactly so the exercise we can pretty much uh get from her uh she always wants to go outside and do things so i'm kind of uh she's an only child too so it's it's not like you can say go out and play with other kids so it's<n>oh  right and so many people work nowadays there you know there's not that many kids in a neighborhood necessarily anymore either<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3193-ms98-a-trans.txt
but anything else uh<n>well we have a lake house and down there when we go down there some on weekends we get a different type of exercise you know just  doing a lot of work and things down there<n>but that and uh and walking is about it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3193-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>that you can go to and do that<n>um one of the ways i don't know uh if this would be helpful it said on the<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3194-ms98-a-trans.txt
colored can to put them in or or something in the city to put like either glass or newspapers or whatever<n>yeah i think they already do that out east um they have to it's a little bit more difficult because people have to remember okay today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic and all that but i think that's the way we need to go it's uh it's pretty bad all these years we've been<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3194-ms98-a-trans.txt
i i don't know what it would take to to get my children to start working on it i<n>i have two older ones that probably would go along with the if i had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project you know<n>it's yeah it's not a big deal you get used to it one let me tell you one interesting thing when i went back to the store and uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3194-ms98-a-trans.txt
okay<n>and i said hey um i understand y'all are taking these bags back uh you know what do you do with them and they had told me  they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then you know go and recycle the rest and i said what do you mean the ones that don't belong there<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3194-ms98-a-trans.txt
i don't mind the spending it's just that i trying to trying to get what you need out of out of what you have that seems to be our challenge so<n>well i don't work outside of the home and he always threatens that when i spend more than what's coming in i have to go back to work so i i manage<n>i see well i'm i'm at home also so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary but uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3195-ms98-a-trans.txt
we do for us very much so in fact we<n>are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just don't go to a new car you know whatever and i said<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3195-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>i know they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and your car<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3196-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh so i don't know if i if i i just feel kind of i my big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our Visa card and i just thought<n>you know if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something you know and we had to had to buy one and we would really need that and<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3196-ms98-a-trans.txt
okay<n>did you want me to go ahead<n>i'll let you go ahead and start yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3198-ms98-a-trans.txt
did you want me to go ahead<n>i'll let you go ahead and start yeah<n>okay well one thing i i i guess both of us have very much aware of the equality<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3198-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>as long as you uh go to school for it and get the education so<n>yeah well i feel like um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3198-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>sex if you wanna stay home and take care of the kids honey that's fine i will go out and make the uh take care of the uh money making and it it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that<n>one of the frustrations that i have with the way things have developed is that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3198-ms98-a-trans.txt
you go ahead and start tell me how you'd you'd organize<n>well why don't you start because you've had more time to think about it if you don't mind<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3199-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries and et cetera and then for some reason<n>taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3200-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's that's kind of hard<n>but do you sort of self budget even though i mean you wouldn't like on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that you kind of think this is got to straight you kind of divide it in fourths in a way don't you<n>no no because if you charge things and uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid or you get paid the last day or next to the last day you pay all your bills then there isn't anything left to spend anyway<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3200-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month<n>well yeah we we tried to to<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3200-ms98-a-trans.txt
then i think if we could really budget we tried one time i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadn't had a car payment in five years<n>we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was gonna be left and that was a real eye opener<n>um-hum yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3200-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum it it is when you do it that way<n>uh-huh but to to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes i'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out<n>so it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're gonna spend going out for fun this is how much you're gonna spend it's kind of hard do you<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3200-ms98-a-trans.txt
so it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're gonna spend going out for fun this is how much you're gonna spend it's kind of hard do you<n>well we we eat out a a good deal at this point i i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money so because i knew that you couldn't you know spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever we were gonna go for ten weeks<n>yeah yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3200-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i never worried about saving money because we just we're in the savings plan at work and they took it out so<n>same here same here and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get  you know yeah<n>i uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3200-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh yeah<n>but that's as far as we go because i take them to a girl at work and she goes and cashes them in because you know i just<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3201-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>i can do that for her and and i don't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3201-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it but uh they actually have the door to door pickup um and it's uh i think it started out to be um<n>just kind of a test a pilot project and it went over so well that they just extended it and it's almost uh i don't know if it's done by a private company or not it may be<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3201-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>but uh they just go around to each uh door and pick it up<n>wow that's excellent that's good<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3201-ms98-a-trans.txt
how would you go about organizing a family reunion<n>well  i from i grew up in the Deep South like south Alabama so whenever i think of family reunions my family like got together almost every week<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3202-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh my<n>for for their family reunion and i  so i mean how i would go about doing it is i would just call all my  relatives<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3202-ms98-a-trans.txt
and we always were we always got together just always<n>now it's different because i live here and i've you know when i go home i try to see the families as much of the family as i can but it's real different and i grew up in a real not  i think not normal setting<n>yes<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3202-ms98-a-trans.txt

um however i do believe that uh guns ought to be maintained and and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people<n>that are angry or have concerns or want to get seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns and in the heat of the moment they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people so<n>on a scale of one to ten i i think i would rate myself as a in the six or seven or eight<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3518-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate uh that uh<n>that might cool down some tempers i think a a one day would be sufficient the reason i say that is there's an awful lot of people who go to gun shows<n>and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun if that five day waiting period were in effect that you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3518-ms98-a-trans.txt

and we've had a uh we save foil which i think a lot of people don't realize they could sell along with the aluminum i mean aluminum cans<n>i think it's true yeah and and there are some areas where i believe they limit it they want you to just strictly go with the cans because of the different content but i think you're right the more often you can<n>well Reynold's aluminum has this big balls of foil competition thing going and i don't know where we're supposed to turn it in another science teacher at school is in charge of that and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3672-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>we just started it this year and it's really nice to be able to have that convenience as opposed to having to go to a local<n>dump and you know take your recyclables i know that i am much more motivated  when i know that they'll come pick it up because there can be so much that you load in your car as to as to when i had to get<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3672-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh it is and it's dirty and<n>yeah and uh sometimes you go to those recycling places and like with cans often times there's a long line<n>uh you know if it's one of those where you get change for your cans<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3672-ms98-a-trans.txt

right it seems like it would be better all the way around if there were more curbside recycling<n>i think so too i i am uh in hopes that that will be successful and that they will decide to go ahead and and spread it to our neighborhood as well<n>the one thing that they don't recycle uh pick up they actually don't care if we mix together the aluminum and the bottles we put those all in one big bag and then put the paper goods separately but the one thing they don't pick up are the plastic goods you know um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3672-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i think<n>i was talking to someone who lives really almost on the other side of town said she knew of one place where you could go and so once a month they made this trek with all their recyclables but they also have a pickup<n>uh and and they would take everything but that is it used to be such a pain and it's so far away from us and that's the only one she knew of<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3672-ms98-a-trans.txt
you have to be motivated to do that when you're that far away after a point<n>so i i guess what we've decided is that we're doing our part by recycling three and going out of our area way but to have to go clear across town for plastic because<n>yeah well the fact that you're doing it at school with the with the kids is a great idea too because then they're also encouraged to learn about how to do that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3672-ms98-a-trans.txt

i really enjoyed uh mountain climbing i really enjoyed skiing um<n>and a lot of outdoor activities and uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in in Texas i can go skiing with that right now but hopefully i'll be able to get back to the slopes someday so<n>that's right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3903-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's right<n>yeah i i've not had the opportunity to to go skiing but<n>i grew up in Arizona which had some mountains around it but uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3903-ms98-a-trans.txt
you didn't<n>no i never did didn't have the i guess i didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing and of course i was at that you know stage of my life where i had to be taken places places i couldn't go by myself but<n>yeah that's true that's true<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3903-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh yeah<n>and so we we went quite often and uh in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing and when i lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago and we would we would go skiing and enjoy that<n>um-hum um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3903-ms98-a-trans.txt
so<n>yeah i i find that if i i make i have to make myself to realize that it's important to get out there and not you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me<n>oh yes oh yes oh yes<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3903-ms98-a-trans.txt
have you participated participated in that in the past<n>well i did with my older daughter and she was in it for a few years but she's got so many interests herself that we had to start eliminating and  that was first one to go she still likes her piano<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3903-ms98-a-trans.txt
different uh locals as far as wet and dry uh climates and uh<n>uh i was kind of like you i'm i didn't want to go back to Colorado because of the different because of the tremendous weather we had<n>gosh i think you're the first person from Colorado i have ever heard that didn't say oh it's wonderful it's so dry here<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3904-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and we go out and tune up the systems<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3904-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's what my i don't know those are some of my feelings i think free enterprise does it for a better price<n>i think you're right there uh it might be a little more ruthless uh to go with the free enterprise system the government has a sort sort of a habit of investing in things that don't pay much return<n>and into getting into projects that uh there is no yield on the investment so it's all money down the rat hole<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3906-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and we got a good living out of it but i know just from talking with him there were it was like you said there are a lot of things that go on that just just make you wonder<n>that they don't really even get the best out of the people that are working for them so it makes me wonder where we're where we're going with that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3906-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and then i think we starting to see now some tendency of women at  mid thirties and so i was saying you know this career thing isn't all it's cracked up to be and i wanna go back and do something else so i think we'll probably see this swind pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3908-ms98-a-trans.txt
i agree<n>it puts them in a very bad situation i i i really don't go for that<n>well i think one of the other things that concern has concerned me a little bit and i think i see some change in attitudes there my wife happens to be a wife who's chosen to stay at home<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3908-ms98-a-trans.txt
doing some of those jobs that she's been handling and you're gonna learn there's a lot of responsibility in just keeping a home going<n>and i hope we reach the point where whatever women women chose to do that's acceptable if they chose to go into the work force that's okay if they choose not to that's acceptable<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3908-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and if they go in the work force they should be treated as nicely as as well as a man or any other person and uh not<n>as equals<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3908-ms98-a-trans.txt
well uh i i was just talking to my dad about that just a couple of weeks ago and i think i think it'd be great that we went to it<n>and uh the the one thing though that i think we should do if we go to the metric system then we should do away with the other system and and have only the metric system<n>well<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3910-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>cause it it's hard to imagine you know i well i think the problem with us our generation is that nobody even if we did go all the way to the metric system that we're still going to think in terms of how it relates to the other system you know<n>well well sure it'd take a new generation it would take a new generation to be just you know completely metric<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3910-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i understand that it's that's true that's very true that's very true<n>so i you know  and and that that and i i think i don't know then all these other old English stories that go back you know that with our uh with our system of measurement<n>yeah that's right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3910-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>that i go out and uh i play ball with them<n>you know it's because like this one that lives right next door her mother does some work at home on computers and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for them<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3911-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>so the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them so i will go out and play catch with them or you know we have let the dogs outside and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs<n>but uh actually i do think that the parents should have you know a little bit more time to spend with their kids<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3911-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum um-hum<n>and then we go back for four years but my husband and i will do the same job and we'll be living in in Africa and we'll be working together<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3911-ms98-a-trans.txt

right<n>and whereas in England where they come up they come up to a kid and they say uh you look like you've got a problem and he says i don't no i don't and then they say well uh let's go they can even go to your apartment and uh<n>force you to open your apartment and anything they find in there is used as evidence so the result is that uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4501-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah<n>um well i can i can vouch for the fact that the uh the appeals will go through and go through and go through<n>and yeah it drags on for about forever you know i guess i'm about your your opinion of it i have nothing against it philosophically<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4502-ms98-a-trans.txt
it's<n>so i you know i don't where it's going to go to in the end i just think that um<n>i i i agree with you i'm not really that terribly against it as long as it looks like it's going to work and reduce the court load and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4502-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh i didn't know<n>so the money from the taxes from the oil go to pay go towards the schools and running of the schools so they're supposed to have a really good program but uh<n>i don't know i just feel like my daughters are in college now and the last three years their life they went to public school and they made straight As and they're really struggling in college now<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4503-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah i think the most important thing that a public school can do to help the problem is to<n>to maybe go backwards in some ways um i find the teachers trying to be like the kids uh telling their kids i teach art and they'll go yeah that's cool well<n>maybe they should talk like grown-ups and the kids should learn to act like grown-ups instead of the grown-ups trying to act like the kids to get their acceptance i find the teachers are very concerned about being liked<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4503-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah i'd heard something as a matter of fact uh kind of along those lines with i think it was the New York school system<n>where they suddenly instituted a sort of market system where um basically the kids were allowed to take whatever classes they wanted to and go to whatever school they wanted to and it was up to the schools to attract the kids<n>um and offer stuff the kids wanted and what turned out happening this was like area of the country with the highest drop out rate and all this kind of stuff  and what ended up happening is people didn't just take fun classes or anything like that uh it ended up that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4526-ms98-a-trans.txt

um<n>well i guess i'll go ahead and start off uh i'm from Kansas originally and uh in growing up you know basically<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4540-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know if you could get some proper training and education it's<n>you know i think you'd you'd find that all the the accidents would definitely go down and i you know i remember taking hunter safety and i was like eleven or twelve years old<n>um-hum yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4540-ms98-a-trans.txt

and and handguns are just fine and i just think you know there's some middle ground there to where<n>that they maybe go overboard and do too much they i guess they do have a lot of lobbying power power and you know their big thing is well if you you stop banning one type then it's going to lead to the next and so on and<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4540-ms98-a-trans.txt

okay i<n>oh okay here we go<n>okay<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4555-ms98-a-trans.txt
right is this something you do on your lunch hour<n>uh no i generally go down there um midafternoon um the time that seems to be best for me is around two o'clock two thirty but<n>oh they allow you that free time to do that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4555-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh they allow you that free time to do that<n>but  yeah and that's you know there are people down there all the time you could almost hold meetings sometimes because people tend to set up a regular schedule and go down there uh but the the etiquette of the place is that you don't really talk too much business<n>oh i really wouldn't have thought they'd give you that much free time this is part of your day<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4555-ms98-a-trans.txt
and it's not like i'm taking time away from the company i probably put in extra hours because i'm now physically fit and<n>reenergized i mean that  my routine around two two thirty to go down there for an hour<n>probably makes the last three hours of the day then more productive than i would if i  you know just sort of went on through so<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4555-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and and it's kind of upsetting because if you go once a week it hurts every single time<n>yes yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4555-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>so it's been uh hectic it takes me a lot more time now to go through my mail<n>oh my Lord here in uh Framingham they just started recycling and we have to mostly they're doing the plastic bottles which we have to soak the labels off of<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4559-ms98-a-trans.txt
and you know milk containers orange juice containers and uh they're doing the newspapers and we have to sort out the ad pages<n>and just you know the regular newspapers go in<n>huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4559-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>and you really have to wing it you know as you go<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4570-ms98-a-trans.txt
how long does that last how long does your meeting last<n>well it it changes it could be a quiet week it could be the kind of thing where kids want to go do something else so it goes pretty quick at the end is allowance so they have to make it through you know collect<n>that sounds like a good theory or a good way to do it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4570-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and um it's it's not something that's impossible i mean the kids will usually want to go to a game park or something you know we can't do that you know we try to keep it real<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4570-ms98-a-trans.txt
so<n>yeah my husband wants to go on a family vacation we're on the east coast like you and he wants to go out to uh the Grand Canyon and do that sort of thing when Helen gets a little older but<n>it's hard to tell i at twenty months old he's he wants take her to the zoo and that sort of thing but i'm not sure if she's ready for any of that if she's you know if it could hold her interest<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4570-ms98-a-trans.txt
hm<n>what help yeah go ahead<n>probably<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4570-ms98-a-trans.txt
well<n>yeah that's kind of a difficult one to go into i mean that that particular case<n>now it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4572-ms98-a-trans.txt
yep<n>and uh the physiological test  tests that go on um really i think you know we are seeing more and more of privacy taken away<n>um courtesy of the federal government as time goes on because of the almighty rights of the employer to know every possible thing about their employees<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4576-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>on the other hand maybe he is i mean  the newspaper men tell us all the politics anyway so maybe he can just go ahead and keep doing it<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4588-ms98-a-trans.txt
no i really don't they need to do more with uh you know the police forces they need to make sure you have more people out on the street i think<n>you know to try to keep track of what's going on and be harder on criminals when they go to court you know make sure they go to jail and they serve all their term<n>it seems<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i i find that attitudes at home are such i mean the kids will curse right in front of my face and<n>they won't even go oops you know they they just have no regard and i'm not saying they're gonna turn into criminals but i think it's a general trend toward<n>people just relaxing their standards so much and i think that's why we have more crime because parents and schools are not stopping this when the kids are young<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum well i think that's like the problem with you know drunk drivers that people don't they're not cracking down they let them back out on the street they don't really take away their license they don't really make sure they can't drive anymore<n>so people don't think it's any big deal and they just go out and do it again nothing's gonna happen to them<n>well we had a yeah we had a big incident at the local high school a teacher who happened to be a parent and four girls were um in a horrible head on accident a drunk driver hit them<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah and i<n>adequate counseling then they just go out and do it again because you haven't really fixed their problem at all<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>so and that's probably the problem too because do you bother counseling these people or you make them go to jail will it really do any good to counsel them or is it just gonna waste taxpayers' money<n>well you know i think counseling is kind of like dieting until you decide you really want it to work you know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4590-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah go ahead<n>okay well um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt
right well i don't have to worry i mean i don't have to think ahead as much like you know but i haven't really saved anything i'm still trying to uh i've i have school debts i'm still paying back and stuff<n>yeah i have three children and a house so uh it's a serious it's a serious matter but uh my wife's just starting to go back to work maybe that'll take the<n>oh okay so you have to budget<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>but also it i think it's bad to have like you know say you have these debts and you you know you're paying a lot of interest on one and you wanna go ahead and get it you know paid off sometimes<n>i've looked at it that way and really just you know pinched myself in other places so that i could do that you know uh pay it off and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4594-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>i don't think should go to jail i think the punishment should fit the crime i think that the jail should be filled with real criminals that are dangerous and i don't think they should get out on parole in three years<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4595-ms98-a-trans.txt
okay<n>go ahead<n>uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4603-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i uh<n>yeah it it for for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative uh public service for uh young people to go into uh after high school um it<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4603-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh who you know are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise wanna<n>uh be in the military you know say okay well you can go into the military or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and and<n>learn about things and it's it's it's interesting because i i'm not a particular fan of the military<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4603-ms98-a-trans.txt
learn about things and it's it's it's interesting because i i'm not a particular fan of the military<n>but i have seen a lot of people a lot of young guys go in that don't have<n>really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined you know even even just personal discipline about what they want to do and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4603-ms98-a-trans.txt

oh you<n>and then if you don't like it why then you know you'll have to go look for a job someplace else<n>uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4605-ms98-a-trans.txt
the Bill of Rights doesn't exit for those guys if you are standing at a corner and somebody and the Bobby walks up to you and he says you've been standing here four buses have gone by uh you're a pickpocket empty your pockets<n>if he finds some things in in there then they will proceed to your house perhaps and uh say open your door up and go in and search your house and after that they can enter at any time<n>hm<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4607-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-huh<n>there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or uh particularly interested in buying something as a you know as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4611-ms98-a-trans.txt
and and that's a that's is a reasonable start and for awhile i didn't read a newspaper when i came out here because i didn't find one that i liked<n>um and if something important happened it was covered on TV and i could then go and and pick up newspapers if if it were important enough to read about<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4611-ms98-a-trans.txt
um why don't you go ahead first<n>okay um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4615-ms98-a-trans.txt

exactly right now yeah it's a bad time you know<n>yeah the interest is so low i mean it it's nice for people buying homes but for older people who have money in CDs or whatever it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4615-ms98-a-trans.txt
the percentage or whatever so or some kind of profit sharing so<n>yeah i'm i'm with a small company now and i hope that uh if we're successful that they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing that'll be very nice<n>sure<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4615-ms98-a-trans.txt

but yet they accept it<n>well the thing of it is if i wanted to just uh you know permanently become a book reader i guess i could just uh you know uh go on public assistance uh<n>you know  look look look for uh look for people to uh take care of me and uh probably a good woman right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4725-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and they they're building old peoples homes uh you know at tax expense sell i think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper<n>at thirty three hundred dollars at or thirty five hundred dollars i'm paying in taxes why i i i could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a rent a house for that right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4725-ms98-a-trans.txt
and they they're building old peoples homes uh you know at tax expense sell i think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper<n>at thirty three hundred dollars at or thirty five hundred dollars i'm paying in taxes why i i i could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a rent a house for that right<n>yeah that's right for<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4725-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah that's right for<n>you know instead instead it's it's the taxes here so course i don't know whether i wanna go to Bulverde or not<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4725-ms98-a-trans.txt
after you retire yeah yeah<n>yeah i'm gonna have go out in and you know in  you know East Fork someplace and and do my thing you know<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4725-ms98-a-trans.txt
because they couldn't pay the taxes and they have no children in school or<n>you know anything now they don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards<n>right they they redecorated in nineteen seventy five you know and they're not doing it again again you know so well it's certainly uh uh you must be a TI employee<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4725-ms98-a-trans.txt
you must be a TI employee<n>no i'm not  no i i don't work i'm a student i go to school i'm in nursing school<n>you're not a TI employee who do you work for<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4725-ms98-a-trans.txt
okay um where uh where do you stand uh<n>well i think that people should be allowed to have them especially if they go hunting which my son goes hunting he goes deer hunting he goes duck hunting<n>on<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and i just think that uh as far as that's concerned he should be able to have them to go hunting with you know as far as just having handguns around to<n>right right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and there's i mean there's nothing you can just go buy one and take it home and you know it's easier than getting uh like a video membership card at you know a video store<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt
i i see now i know they were having a gun show uh about a month ago and i was just wondering how that did work if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show<n>uh yeah yeah you just go and uh buy the gun and uh<n>there's no restriction though you don't have to wait or nothing then huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt
no well except for the the pistols and i i'm not sure how they do that i know they used<n>yeah i was just curious you know because uh i know at at the regular gun show you know gun shop that you that you do have to wait for pistols like a couple of weeks and then they check you out then they call you up and you have go pick it up<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah yeah i'm not sure i'm not really sure but what uh the the gun laws in uh Pennsylvania Pennsylvania are like<n>um-hum  no  we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that but like i say my son he's<n>no<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>but he's always he went to the to the school to learn how to shoot it he goes to the pistol range and uh and the rifle range to shoot them he likes to go to that uh shotgun thing where you shoot at those um<n>oh yeah the skeets you mean<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah right right<n>and so you know they they would just all the profits would go to you know<n>now i do believe though like in California if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has i think they're liable now for it<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt
and so they just fit in there when they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work but right now i can right now i can throw them all in the back when we have room and uh<n>there you go<n>and since i do a lot of projects i throw things in the back and i kind of like having a pickup truck actually i think of it as a  as a car that'll last<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4728-ms98-a-trans.txt
let somebody else break it in right<n>right and uh the van we're sort sort of we might go again on a on a van uh we we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time i'm not sure<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4728-ms98-a-trans.txt
i'm sure he does yeah<n>yeah so you know you how when was the last time you took out took your truck out just to just to go driving<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4728-ms98-a-trans.txt
no<n>and i go out twice a week on the bike so at least just for the enjoyment<n>yeah it's like<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4728-ms98-a-trans.txt
um i don't know about you but uh i work outside the home and uh<n>in fact uh i'll be leaving very shortly to go to work and i work different shifts so are pretty much a<n>a later shift to where i don't have the family time uh when my husband gets home it's usually he's home with my daughter alone and then uh couple of hours later i'm home<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4745-ms98-a-trans.txt
sure exactly<n>and i also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to day care every day<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4745-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i'm finding as i volunteer up at the school<n>i just a being um i'm not educated at all in um really detecting this but i can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty good basis after i've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to day care and which kids stay home<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4745-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>not that the kids that go out aren't getting that it's just a different they're they are more used to being with their own age kids they're not use to being with adults and to responding to adults<n>yeah yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4745-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties uh were staying at home with their kids<n>and then made the decision well jeez you know i'll go out and get a part time job got a part time job and then financially they got themselves into well i'll have the boat i'll have the car and it's nice<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4745-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and you have to make that decision to go back to work part time or go back to work full time and you have to make that decision and it's a tough one and i<n>right i think one of the things that people look at too though is um spending how they spend their time with their children<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4745-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh really<n>so probably i'll go ahead and break down and<n>you know i guess i guess from the school  this is just not professional you know  so i'm kind of a hold out<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4746-ms98-a-trans.txt
and the dashboard just looked good to me it was just no nonsense had the the speedometer uh speedometer and the tach and the couple of other little gauges like engine heat but none of the you know big flashy electronic stuff<n>yeah i i've continually i've come to learn in having this car that it was fully loaded when we got it and the problem is it's the fully loaded gives the car more chances for things to go wrong<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4749-ms98-a-trans.txt
apparently was a problem year for them because<n>they you know what's happened is most people have just gotten rid of them as soon as you know they pass the three year mark and things start going they go and buy a new car<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4749-ms98-a-trans.txt
and that's what kills cars up here is you know the salt rusts them out and then they die years before you you know a car from California might be undrivable<n>right or or they they die of rust years before their major systems would otherwise go out<n>yeah that's that's what happened basically to our last car i mean it just this rust took over and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4749-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i think i think uh it's uh seems to be that<n>i don't know some people they tend they do something you know they shoot somebody or whatever they go to jail<n>sentenced to jail for like thirty years they're out in five and they're back on the street and then they shoot someone else and just cyclical cyclical cyclical and it seems seems as though the the system doesn't  tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4752-ms98-a-trans.txt
it's just that too many people argue about how to fix it<n>yeah i know when i lived in Oakland it was just that uh like i definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of of the city by myself<n>oh sure<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4752-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh sure<n>and uh and then then again some areas i wouldn't go by myself after dark<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4752-ms98-a-trans.txt
but down here in Patterson<n>well like i say it's so small that you can go anywhere<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4752-ms98-a-trans.txt
think is wrong with the public school system is that i think we've lately in the last twenty years or so kind of lost focus with the basics<n>uh in order to go into this sort of specialized curriculum where uh we're teaching kids<n>not a broad base of subjects but rather trying to concentrate them on particular subject areas that they think they might be interested in going into a career<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4756-ms98-a-trans.txt
and i think you know it's those kinds of things that<n>i i'm not sure how we go about fixing something like that other than maybe devoting some more uh<n>uh resources into first of all getting uh the uh teachers reasonable salaries and uh expecting in return some sort of standard<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4756-ms98-a-trans.txt
which i've never liked very much but she seems to<n>yeah i don't i if i you know if if i happen to find it i'll go ahead and read it someplace you know if i'm in a doctor's office or something like that but other than that i never i never liked that really<n>do you read a newspaper<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4758-ms98-a-trans.txt
it gives you a different perspective on what people do<n>um-hum um-hum well those travel magazines are that more or less show you different countries that you could go to or<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4758-ms98-a-trans.txt
why don't you go ahead with the fishing part<n>well uh i mostly do i fish for uh bass<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt
i'd rather have the blue gills the sunnies the crappies the perch<n>um to me they're better tasting so i always seem to go fishing for the smaller um<n>smaller fish versus the big fish<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt
but um when i was growing up my father kind of introduced me to fly fishing<n>and that was kind of a very interesting uh experience that i had and i'm sure that part of me would like to go back and do that it's kind of like for trout fishing<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt
the most<n>if i go fishing it's basically with the worm at the end of the hook and i you know try to catch the small fish it's it's not for the big try to try to get the biggie so<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>i use a fly  quite a bit uh when i go bass fishing<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>i had a chance to go to uh Alaska for six weeks last summer and did some salmon fishing up there and that was really uh<n>oh gosh yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>but it seems like if you go fishing like in the middle of the summer when it's hot and humid uh the fish tastes  tastes fishy<n>versus um when the water it's just opened up from the ice and the water temperature is extremely cold<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>it's almost the better tasting fish are either ice fishing uh when you go ice fishing or<n>when uh you know you go right towards the early spring part uh before summer hits because after summer whether the ponds here aren't that deep or the water just changes and it gets busier and more people are out on the lakes<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt
it's almost the better tasting fish are either ice fishing uh when you go ice fishing or<n>when uh you know you go right towards the early spring part uh before summer hits because after summer whether the ponds here aren't that deep or the water just changes and it gets busier and more people are out on the lakes<n>and less maybe water like in the spring we have lots of rain coming in<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt
and and i i feel as though uh that uh uh you know that if you you are a drug user you have a hidden agenda<n>that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background of course we're  being involved in my organization uh we we have deep background checks and<n>sure sure<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4765-ms98-a-trans.txt
um but i guess i feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business<n>um and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that uh things like drug laws seem to come and go<n>you know we had prohibition for awhile and then we didn't have prohibition<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4765-ms98-a-trans.txt
well but you got to look at prohibition though you had the same problems there right<n>uh that that people go into to to support drug habit<n>yeah you know they they support drug habits with uh with uh you you know with things like uh you know burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that yeah yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4765-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i i do believe there are people that are truly concerned about um<n>society and making a better a better world and go in it<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4769-ms98-a-trans.txt
it really<n>if you go to to uh to solve root problems they take a while<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4769-ms98-a-trans.txt
absolutely<n>and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go i mean yeah that's what's in you know Los Angeles is i think that's biggest problem<n>because when i was in Los Angeles for a time it's all you know from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4771-ms98-a-trans.txt
so it's just like i don't know i<n>i guess i guess i'd have to go with uh i i i'd be for it<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4774-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know i i i don't know it's just kind of a<n>kind of a delicate subject i guess but i i i would i would probably go for for going ahead and doing it you know if it's got to be done for everyone<n>right i think if it's got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing it should be for everybody<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4774-ms98-a-trans.txt
but uh<n>i voted with my feet and uh my kids go to parochial school<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4784-ms98-a-trans.txt

um no we've had them out in uh kind of wilderness uh areas before we go camping<n>so you go camping do you i see well that's kind of good<n>and we've had them at resorts uh you know smaller resort places uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4787-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah<n>yeah that's true and in fact they're even letting some go i'm i'm originally i'm originally from Florida and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just because they don't have room for them<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4792-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>uh i suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off uh very exciting<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4796-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh i'm not you know there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as uh you know with the space shuttle and all<n>although plans to uh go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to uh the sixties<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4796-ms98-a-trans.txt
the process itself gets so drug out and so<n>you know i understand you need to prove without a shadow of a doubt that the guilt and whatnot but the appeal process of it i think is what really bugs me if you're gonna make it go so long you know what's the use of it<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4798-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh<n>and then she had to go back in a couple of times<n>but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4799-ms98-a-trans.txt

fact i<n>because i i remember her in her letters telling me she she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat so i'm assuming it's something like that too so<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4799-ms98-a-trans.txt
so<n>we haven't had to do anything but then again she has a lot of support so i mean she's got her mother in town too and things like that so hopefully we won't need to go that route<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4799-ms98-a-trans.txt
well i i think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary you know a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's it's almost like that you know they say putting them out to pasture<n>and some some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active they they wanted to do things they didn't you know they didn't wanna go down and play bingo or um<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4799-ms98-a-trans.txt

did the drug testing thing after that<n>so uh it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests and and then they essentially give you the offer<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4812-ms98-a-trans.txt
uh-huh<n>and then at that point they'll they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that<n>oh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4812-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and then maybe give you another chance to go through it<n>but uh you know once again those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know but um what are you working right now anywhere or<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4812-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh<n>they basically uh did the same exact thing um we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug tresting at the same time so one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process but uh<n>do do they test you at right now at work too<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4812-ms98-a-trans.txt
