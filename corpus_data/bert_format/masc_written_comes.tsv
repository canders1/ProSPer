 huge difference, for example, between playing a game like "Quake" and listening to a radio broadcast that tells you that your family will be killed unless you take action to kill others now. [SEP] The latter is the kind of media propaganda that was used to unleash a genocide in Rwanda in 1994, which killed 800,000 people. [SEP] Similarly, the main motivation for the crusades (beyond the promise of wealth) was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved. [SEP] Obviously, media propaganda can incite people to kill. [SEP] Interactive fiction like video games, on the other hand, presents violence in a narrative context, which may very well desensitize participants to said violence, but no causative link has ever been proven. [SEP] Moore's hypothesis (which apparently	comes	at least in part from the book "Culture of Fear" by Barry Glassner, also advertised on Moore's website) is that the constant bombardment with messages of fear can incite paranoia, which itself can lead to violent acts. [SEP] This is consistent with the kind of media-incited violence described above, and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music incited violence. [SEP] It is no surprise, however, that US (and European) media do not question their own propaganda of fear. [SEP] Moore's second hypothesis is that America's foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts, a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists.

ver attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence. [SEP] The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions, which is unfortunate, but Moore's critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly. [SEP] Had they done so, Moore himself would probably have apologized for the gaffe. [SEP] In any case, at no point does Moore make a false statement, in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is "full of lies". [SEP] 5) You write: "Having created the desired impression, Moore follows with his Heston interview." [SEP] No, he doesn't. [SEP] You accuse Moore so often of changing the chronology, yet you have no problems changing it yourself. [SEP] The Heston interview is at the very end of the movie. [SEP] After the Flint rally	comes	a brief TV interview with Heston, where he is asked about Kayla Rolland (again, clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRA's presence), then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch, entirely ignored by critics of the film, who also mentions Heston's presence as notable, and refers to the immediate reactions of "people from all over America", gun owners/groups who, according to him, reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children, much like spanking advocates react aggressively when anti-spankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating. [SEP] These people do not feel the need to express sympathy, or to think about ways to avoid such incidents, but they feel the need to assert their "rights" and 	#essays#	essays_A_defense_of_Michael_Moore.txt	come	written	masc_written	4
Conclusion You write: "Bowling for Columbine is dishonest. It is fraudulent. To trash Heston, it even uses the audio/video editor to assemble a Heston speech that Heston did not give, and sequences images and carefully highlighted text to spin the viewer's mind to a wrong conclusion." [SEP] None of this is true. [SEP] What is true is that Bowling for Columbine is a diamond in the small world of big screen documentaries, one that shines brightly and illuminates an often misunderstood aspect of American culture. [SEP] It is not a flawless diamond -- the "48 hours" scene in particular suffers from bad editing, the statistics are suboptimal, and Heston gets a bit more bashing than he deserves. [SEP] Other than towards the NRA, the movie tries hard to avoid simplistic conclusions, and	comes	up with some thoughtful answers. [SEP] The most shameful part of the ongoing attacks against Moore is that these answers have been all but ignored by his critics. [SEP] Had Moore wanted to make a propaganda film, he would have used other material: photos from America's Emergency Rooms. [SEP] Certainly, Moore is one of the most talented filmmakers in the United States today, and his film fully deserved its Oscar. [SEP] The shrill (and remarkably unsuccessful) Internet campaign to "revoke" his award seems to be motivated more by jealousy than by real concerns about the film's accuracy. [SEP] It is not only the highest grossing non-music documentary of all time, among the users of the largest Internet film database, IMDB, it is also the highest rated one.

The Rediscovery of Language and Identity Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others. [SEP] This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture: a group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs	comes	to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity, discernible from that of those “outside” them, those who do not belong. [SEP] Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing, food, lifestyle choices. [SEP] One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language. [SEP] The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it, is often the key to gaining entry. [SEP] In turn communal identity can be formed around a language; it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers. [SEP] Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key.

re long and narrow and wider on the foothill side than on the craton side. [SEP] Punga Lake is superimposed over the structure of the Santa Elena uplift (Dumont and Garcia, 1991), which is interpreted as a crystalline horst surrounded by Paleozoic sedimentary strata (Laurent, 1985). [SEP] The NE elongation of the lake is parallel to a few of the structural features mentioned by Laurent (1985). [SEP] Both lakes are also parallel to the strike of normal faulting with a NNW–SSE extension in the upland border (Dumont et al., 1988). [SEP] As a result, the lakes are interpreted as the surface expression of tensional stress superimposed over reactivated basement structures due to the onset of Andean tectonics (Dumont and Garcia, 1991). [SEP] More precise morphological evidence of active tectonics	comes	from the Punga Lake.

[SEP] In this very flat area the water level rises about 2 m during floods, suggesting a minimum subsidence of 4 m over about 70 years.
