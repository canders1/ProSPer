tex and other brain structures is necessary before children can store experiences in ways that permit them to be retrieved many years later.62 [SEP] Similarly, several psychological explanations focus on changes in the nature of memory during the preschool years—from an unconscious, automatic, and nonverbal system to one that is conscious, deliberate, and verbal.63 [SEP] Perhaps the second system cannot access events stored by the ﬁrst, making the earliest events of our lives forever irretrievable. [SEP] Yet the idea of vastly dierent approaches to remembering at young and older ages has been questioned. [SEP] Children 1 1/2 to 3 years old can describe their memories verbally.64 [SEP] And sometimes they even recall events that happened to them as preverbal infants! [SEP] For example, while	walking	past a distinctive house with a fenced-in front yard, 22-month-old Lisa said to her mother, “Scary doggy!” [SEP] Nine months earlier (before the child could talk), the family had taken the same walk. [SEP] On that occasion, Lisa had seen a ferocious dog barking behind the chain-linked fence. [SEP] Over time, neither the family walk nor the scary dog will be part of Lisa’s personally relevant memory. [SEP] Yet the train trip across the country she will take at age 3 1/2 and her ﬁrst day of kindergarten at age 5 may still be memorable when she is 80. [SEP] A growing number of researchers believe that rather than a radical change in the way experience is coded into memory, two other milestones lead infantile amnesia to give way to memory for personally signiﬁcant experiences:	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
Adivinanzas (Riddles) Adivinanzas are riddles. [SEP] Many Chicano children remember being entertained with riddles narrated by parents and grandparents. [SEP] A riddle is an intellectual brainteaser, in Spanish called a quebracabeza; facts are framed in the form of a question in such a way that the respondent cannot possibly know the answer. [SEP] An example in Spanish is, “Qué camina de cuatro patas por la mañana, dos patas en el medio día, y tres patas en la noche?” (What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night?) The answer is man, who as a child, in the “morning” of life, crawls on four legs; as an adult walks on two legs; and as an old man uses a cane for support, thus	walking	on three legs. [SEP] Another example is a “true riddle,” which is a comparison of something to the unknown answer, and that something is described in the question. [SEP] For example, “Tengo ojos y no miro; boca pero no hablo; qué soy?” (I have eyes and cannot see; a mouth, but cannot speak; What am I?) The answer is a photograph. [SEP] Another type of riddle is the conundrum, where the answer is contained in the riddle itself, such as “Agua pasa por mi casa cate de mi corazon” (Water passes by my house pain of my heart). [SEP] The answer is “agua-cate” (avocado). [SEP] Or, “Lana sube, lana baja” (Wool goes up and wool goes down). [SEP] The answer is “la navaja,” la-na-baja (the knife). [SEP] Conundrums contain wordplay and in Chicano culture are sometimes bilingual, playing with words in bo	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
 way to commemorate many holidays such as Halloween, Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), Cinco de Mayo (Fifth of May), and even the Fourth of July. [SEP] A yard shrine may be a permanent display in the form of a small chapel, a nicho (niche), or a gruta (grotto or shrine), set up in the front yard of a home. [SEP] It may contain one or more holy images, of saints or the Virgin Mary, especially La Virgen de Guadalupe, flowers or potted plants, colorful garlands, and votive candles. [SEP] These shrines are often just called nichos, and the word shrine is not even mentioned. [SEP] During special holidays such as Christmas or on a saint’s feast day, a shrine may be lighted up for the community to share. [SEP] It is a common practice to make the sign of the cross or recite a short prayer when	walking	past a religious yard shrine. [SEP] In many families the shrine is erected as the result of a promesa or manda (promise or vow) made to a particular saint, or in memory of a family member who has died. [SEP] A yard shrine, whether called a nicho or a gruta, can be decorated in various ways. [SEP] There are always plants and flowers, sometimes seashells decorate the outside if it is constructed of cement, and the decorations will reflect the holiday season of the year. [SEP] At Christmas, there may be lights, tinsel, and poinsettias. [SEP] During Lent there may be lilies and pastel paper chains. [SEP] Yard shrines demonstrate that religion is integrated into the life of a family, and they are considered to be sacred sites for prayer and devotion. [SEP] There is no division between the public	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chY.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
The word zoot was known within the urban jazz culture of Harlem, and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style. [SEP] Many African Americans wore an extravagant style of clothing, the baggy pegged pants and jackets with padded shoulders, that later became known as the zoot suit. [SEP] In the novel Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison, he describes the zoot--suiters’ style, “	walking	slowly, their shoulders swaying, their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles; their coats long and hip-tight with shoulders far too broad to be those of natural western men” (1947, 380). [SEP] In the late-night jazz scenes of Harlem this style was “a killer-diller coat with a drape-shape, reat-pleats and shoulders padded like a lunatic’s cell” (380). [SEP] Tyler makes the point that the zoot suit was an extremely symbolic costume, which gave the wearer the look of a child in adult clothing. [SEP] The broad square shoulders gave a macho look to the youth, and the finger-tipped coat was made for fun and leisure. [SEP] The long baggy pants were made for dancing, especially the jitterbug, and the wide Panama hats were another 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chZ.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2

In the meantime, Caldas de Monchique is a good place for a picnic and a stroll in the woods. [SEP] The local waters are bottled and for sale across the Algarve. [SEP] North of Caldas, the road weaves uphill quickly, rising 300 m (1,000 ft) in 5 km (3 miles) past terraced farmlands and forests of eucalyptus, oak, and cork. [SEP] Monchique is a small market town, known for its handicrafts and the famous Manueline portico of its 16th-century Igreja Matriz. [SEP] The beautiful, uncommon church has Romanesque arches, stone columns, blue-and-yellow azulejos, and a handsome wood ceiling. [SEP] If you poke around town, you’ll probably see artisans crafting shoes and pounding out	walking	sticks in closet-sized workshops. [SEP] High above the town, the ruins of a 17th-century convent, Nossa Senhora do Desterro, loom like a ghostly gray eminence. [SEP] Closed to the public, it has apparently been seized by squatters, who’ve done little towards its upkeep other than festoon it with “Private–Family” and “Family Dog” signs.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
t are two other reminders of the once-thriving Jewish community. [SEP] In a stark, exposed position near the road in Jonas Daniël Meijerplein, is the Dokwerker Statue by Mari Andriessen. [SEP] This figure of a true working man commemorates the day in February 1941 when the dock workers rose up in protest against the Nazi deportation of the Jews. [SEP] Behind the statue is the Portugese-Israëlitische Synagoge (Portuguese Synagogue) which was inaugurated in 1675 for the Spanish and Portuguese Sephardic Jews who settled in the city. [SEP] Its design is said to be based on that of King Solomon’s Temple. [SEP] From Jonas Daniël Meijerplein look southeast to the glass houses of the Hortus Botanicus (Botanical Gardens) easily seen just across the Nieuwe Herengracht canal. [SEP] Cross the canal by	walking	left along its banks to the nearby bridge. [SEP] Once across, you have entered the Plantage area of the city, once an area of parkland but which developed from the mid-19th century into one of the first city suburbs. [SEP] The Botanical Gardens have a long and illustrious history. [SEP] They began as a small medicinal garden in 1682, but soon became the depository for many of the new plant species brought from Dutch colonies in the Golden Age and were responsible for developing each genus for cultivation, propagation and commercial exploitation. [SEP] The distinctive glass houses were added in 1912, and today the gardens have one of the largest collections in the world.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
Many of the old and confined Victorian enclosures where the animals were kept have been redeveloped in the 1990s to create more fitting environments for their majestic and healthy-looking animals. [SEP] The Planetarium and other areas of Artis offer fun ways to learn about the world around us and are entertaining for adults and children alike. [SEP] Southeast of Artis, across two canals and busy roads, is Oosterpark, an open green area with a lake and play areas (we would suggest taking a tram — numbers 9 and 14 — rather than	walking	here from the city center). [SEP] In the northern corner of the park is the Tropenmuseum, once the home of the Dutch Colonial Institute. [SEP] The building itself was built in 1926 and built especially to house the institute’s collection of artifacts from the tropics.Today the aim of the museum is to improve our knowledge of the world’s tropical areas, and promotes an understanding of the peoples in these developing parts of the world. [SEP] A vast collection of artifacts from the former Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) was the starting point for the displays, which range from tribal masks to tools and utensils in daily use. [SEP] Recreations of a Bombay street and Arab souk, among other locales, bring home the reality of life in these very different societies.

ance for concrete can give it a drab and shabby look even on the brightest of days. [SEP] In the latter years of the 20th century very little was done to improve matters. [SEP] The population grew but the infrastructure was not developed, resulting in gridlock of the urban traffic system, smog, and noise pollution. [SEP] Today, at first glance nothing seems to have changed. [SEP] A brown layer of pollution hangs over the city in both hot and cold weather; the seemingly endless hooting of horns down the wide boulevards and the drone of vehicles making painfully slow progress through the narrow streets raises noise levels; and in a city with so many apartments and so little parking it’s no surprise that sidewalks become places to leave your vehicle, and pedestrians must risk life and limb by	walking	on the roads. [SEP] Perhaps this picture seems a little bleak, but there is one positive factor that eases the concern about visiting Athens. [SEP] It’s so easy to escape the city completely that one needn’t feel trapped by the urban environment. [SEP] Within an hour of being at Syntagma Square outside the National Parliament building (the symbolic heart of the city), you could easily be sitting at the quayside of some small Greek island having a cooling drink, or enjoying the pine forest of the countryside of Attica — the region that surrounds the capital.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-Intro.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
Where to Go V iewed from the air — or from the high ground of the Acropolis or Mount Lycabettus — Athens is a sprawling city; a maze of apartment blocks and office buildings stretching as far as the eye can see. [SEP] Yet the downtown area is remarkably compact. [SEP] Most of the major sites are within	walking	distance of one another, but the inexpensive and reliable Metro system links many museums and attractions for those who get a little foot weary. [SEP] Ancient remains are scattered across the central downtown area and Athens has grown almost organically throughout its history, resulting in numerous districts, each with its own particular character. [SEP] This guide divides the city into a number of sections, covering the ancient center of the city first and then moving clockwise through the other important districts. [SEP] Attractions featured will include major squares, gardens, ruins, monuments, and museums.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
so met here late in its history. [SEP] The whole auditorium held 17,000 people, but most interesting are the carved front row thrones for VIPs, including one with lion’s-claw feet that was reserved for the priest Dionysus Eleutherios. [SEP] The particularly fine bema of Phaedros (carved stage) depicting scenes from the life Dionysus — god of wine and merriment — is of Roman origin. [SEP] Surrounding the theater are remains of several other buildings including an Asclepieion (place of healing) and Odeon of Pericles. [SEP] These are currently being worked on by archaeologists. [SEP] To the west of the Acropolis stands another small range of hills now cut by footpaths and covered in trees offering cooling shade in the heat of summer. [SEP] This area, reached by crossing Odós Rovertou Gali and	walking	up behind the Dionysus restaurant, offers splendid views across to the Acropolis (it’s the best place for afternoon overviews), and the Sound and Light Show auditorium is located here for this reason. [SEP] Several archaeological sites can be seen and the area is much less crowded than the Acropolis itself. [SEP] You’ll also see the 16th century church, Ayios Dimítrios Loumbardhi, nestling under the woodland canopy. [SEP] In the northeastern area, you’ll come to the Hill of the Pnyx, meeting place of the Assembly of Athens. [SEP] Loosely translated, pnyx means “crowded or tightly packed place,” and in ancient times this was a highly populated area. [SEP] You’ll see the outlines of walls, including the defensive Themistoklean Wall, between the bushes or under the turf as you stroll.

Leading directly east from Syntagma Square is Avenue Vas. [SEP] Sofias. [SEP] This main thoroughfare, with a number of major embassies, leads to several important museums all within strolling distance or close to the Evangelismos Metro station. [SEP] Closest to Syntagma is the Benáki Museum, a collection donated to the state by Andónis Benáki on his death in 1954. [SEP] Benáki was born in a Greek community in Egypt, and many of the artifacts on display originate from this other ancient land, though there is a good range of Classical and Roman statuary, and collections from the Early Christian and Byzantine eras including two paintings by El Greco. [SEP] On the same side of the street	walking	away from Syntagma is the Museum of Cycladic and Ancient Art run under the auspices of the Goulandrís Foundation. [SEP] This museum celebrates the art dating from before the development of Athens city-state — discovered in the Cyclades islands of the Aegean (c2000–3000 b.c.) A wonderful collection of naïve figurines carved in marble was discovered in graves on the islands. [SEP] Most of the figures are female, suggesting the worship of fertility or an earth-mother religion. [SEP] Maps and drawings help visitors better understand this mysterious ancient people. [SEP] In addition, the museum shows around 300 objects dating from Classical, Hellenic, and Roman Greece including a collection of finely preserved bronze vessels.

[SEP] Many tour companies run day trips, sometimes combining visits to Besakih (see page 60) and Penelokan (see page 58). [SEP] This is an easy way to see the views, but you will arrive at the same time as hundreds of others. [SEP] With more and more accommodations opening, think about overnighting at a mountain resort, or an inexpensive guest house.

ntjuïc hill, or the waterfront; or you can create a greatest-hits tour of Gaudí and his fellow Modernista architects. [SEP] It’s tempting to try to sandwich everything into just a couple of days, but be sure to leave time in your schedule to get sidetracked in a colorful food market or an alley of antiques shops, or to peek in a quiet courtyard. [SEP] Take a breather, as Barcelonans do, sinking into a chair at a sidewalk table to linger over a drink and snack, read a newspaper, and people-watch. [SEP] In the old town, where many streets are too narrow for cars and a slow pace is amply rewarded with the discovery of hidden treasures, the best way to travel is on foot. [SEP] Each district of the old quarter — Barri Gòtic, La Ribera, Las Ramblas — and the Eixample district can be covered as a	walking	tour. [SEP] For sights farther afield, including Montjuïc, Barceloneta and the waterfront, Tibidabo, and two of the top Gaudí attractions, La Sagrada Familia and Parque Guëll, it’s best to make use of Barcelona’s excellent public transportation network — clean and efficient metro trains (subway), modern buses, funiculars, and cable cars — as well as plenty of inexpensive taxis (see Public Transportation, p. 121). [SEP] A good map is essential, but it’s easy to be fooled by how near things look on paper. [SEP] La Rambla	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
st unusual collection. [SEP] The Gothic wing is excellent, too. [SEP] Many of the paintings are retablos, many-paneled screens with Gothic-arched frames that stood behind chapel altars. [SEP] Among the treasures are Lluís Dalmau’s Virgin of the Councillors, with its portraits, full of character, of the politicos who commissioned the work for the City Hall chapel in 1445; Jaume Ferrer II’s stylishly hatted St. Jerome; and a very fine retable of St. John the Baptist with saints Sebastian and Nicholas. [SEP] Up the hill and across the street is the Museu Arqueològic (Archaeological Museum). [SEP] Among the many interesting exhibits drawn mainly from prehistoric, Iberian, Greek, and Roman sites in Catalonia are reconstructions of tombs and life-like dioramas. [SEP] Around another curve, within	walking	distance up the hill, is the Museu Etnològic (Ethnological Museum). [SEP] This well-presented collection usually has a special rotating program highlighting the native arts of Latin America and other lands. [SEP] Farther up Montjuïc, turn left where the Avinguda de l’Estadi (the Olympic Ring boulevard) becomes the Avinguda de Miramar, to see the simple and elegant Fundació Joan Miró. [SEP] The museum was designed in 1975 by the architect Josep Lluís Sert to house a large collection of paintings, drawings, tapestries, and sculpture by the Catalan surrealist. [SEP] Miró died in 1983 at the age of 90. [SEP] The exhibits follow Miró’s artistic development from 1914 onwards.

Bailey’s Bay Bailey’s Bay is the northern section of Hamilton Parish, which you’ll find just before reaching the Causeway that crosses Castle Harbour to the airport and St. George’s. [SEP] Bailey’s Bay has a number of attractions within	walking	distance of each other. [SEP] If traveling by bus, get off at the Swizzle Inn, famed across the island for its “Rum Swizzle” drinks (made from a secret recipe); it’s also a great place for lunch. [SEP] Only a short walk west from the Inn, you will find the Bermuda Perfumery and Gardens. [SEP] This small family business was established in 1929 by Madeleine and Herbert Scott in a garden shed. [SEP] They moved to their present site in 1939 and proceeded to plant the acres of flowers that serve as raw materials to produce their small range of signature fragrances. [SEP] The business has now been passed on to their son.

[SEP] Farther along, South Road moves closer to the coast, and Spittal Pond Nature Reserve soon appears to the right. [SEP] Its 14 hectares (34 acres) comprise Bermuda’s largest wildlife sanctuary, a home for migratory and native bird species alike. [SEP] Two ponds provide a marshy wetland, complemented by a coastal cliff environment beloved by terns and visiting longtails. [SEP] Owls and the obligatory kiskadee inhabit the woodlands. [SEP] Spittal Pond is well known for providing rest and recuperation for birds blown off course on long migratory routes: it is possible to spot unusual species that have drifted off their normal routes. [SEP] Well-worn	walking	trails at the park are easy to follow, but be aware that there are two car parks at the sanctuary (east and west). [SEP] Don’t forget which one you parked in! [SEP] The main road leads east along the coast to John Smith’s Bay, a small but much-photographed beach for swimming and snorkeling. [SEP] Just beyond the bay, there is a left turn leading to Devil’s Hole Aquarium, at the very southern tip of Harrington Sound. [SEP] One of the oldest tourist attractions in Bermuda, it has been welcoming visitors since 1834. [SEP] The hole is in fact a collapsed cave, producing a natural seawater aquarium that has become home to a number of voracious fish, sharks, and turtles waiting at the surface to be fed.

[SEP] Choose a clear day, then catch any one of several trams or buses which go past the cog-railway terminus (just west of Moszkva tér, opposite the Hotel Budapest). [SEP] There is room on the train for mountain bikes if you are feeling particularly active. [SEP] The train passes smart residential houses on its way to the terminus and park of Sváb-hegy. [SEP] A short walk across the park (just follow the crowds) is the stop for the Children’s Railway (Széchenyi-hegyi Gyermekvasút), thus named because it is operated almost entirely by school-children; only the engine drivers are adults. [SEP] This is an old narrow-gauge line which traverses seemingly unspoiled forests — but for the numerous	walking	trails — and climbs, slowly, ever-upwards. [SEP] At the ﬁrst stop, Normafa, you’ll find a ski-run, but unless it’s snowing stay on the train until János-hegy. [SEP] It is a 10–15 minute walk from here to the János-hegy lookout tower, at 529 metres (1,735 feet) the highest point in the city. [SEP] If the horizon is not blurred by mist, there’s a splendid 360-degree view for mile upon mile; you can also eat here. [SEP] On the way to the lookout tower you will have passed a chair-lift that goes down to a camping site. [SEP] The views from the chair-lift are also spectacular, and the peace and quiet as you soar up and down the mountainside is quite extraordinary.

San Francisco San Franciscans are quite unashamedly in love with their town. [SEP] Its natural setting, nestled in the hills around the bay, makes the city uncommonly cozy; the zip in the air is invigorating, and even the fog that rolls in off the ocean seems more romantic than chilling. [SEP] If you have a car, one way to begin your visit is to travel along 49-Mile Drive, which provides a comprehensive tour of the main sights. [SEP] You’ll need to use a good map, as the blue signposts with a white seagull in the center can be difficult to locate. [SEP] Stop off at Twin Peaks (the road to get there starts near the southern end of Market Street) for an excellent panoramic view of the city and the bay, then park the car, put on a pair of comfortable	walking	shoes, and take to the city’s first-class public transport system (see page 120). [SEP] Start at the bridge. [SEP] The city has more than one, but the one is, of course, the Golden Gate Bridge. [SEP] The name Golden Gate was given to the city’s harbor entrance in 1846 by Captain John Frémont, but the mile-wide channel lay unspanned until the bridge, a masterpiece of engineering by Joseph Strauss, was completed in 1937. [SEP] At 4,200 ft (1,280 m), it was the world’s longest single span until New York’s Verrazano Narrows Bridge surpassed it in 1964, but few would deny that it remains the most beautiful suspension bridge in the world. [SEP] It took four years and $35 million to build; more than 40 million vehicles now cross over the span every year.

[SEP] A tour of Nob Hill (from California Street or by Powell-Hyde cable car), Telegraph Hill (bus), and Russian Hill (Powell-Hyde cable car) will give you a good sense of the past and present splendors of San Francisco’s more wealthy residents. [SEP] The cable cars were installed in 1873 by British-born engineer Andrew Hallidie; one of the originals can still be seen in the fascinating Cable Car Barn and Museum at Washington and Mason streets, which is also the system’s working powerhouse. [SEP] The hand-made cars are the city’s best-loved attraction, and the system was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2

[SEP] In addition to your light summer wear, be sure to bring a sweater for the occasional chilly evenings. [SEP] Rather than weighing down your luggage with anything cumbersome, take a leaf out of the Canadians’ book and keep warm by wearing several layers.

Between rue St-Antoine and the port and flanked by rue McGill and rue Berri, this is the site of Maisonneuve’s original settlement of Ville-Marie (Métro Champ-de-Mars). [SEP] All but a few stones of the 18th-century city ramparts have gone, but many historic houses have been restored to evoke some of the flavor of New France. [SEP] The colorful, tree-lined Place Jacques-Cartier makes a good point from which to start a	walking	tour (or a riding tour in a horse-drawn calèche available here for hire). [SEP] An itinerary can be mapped out over coffee at one of the many pleasant sidewalk cafés. [SEP] Once a fruit and vegetable market, the cobblestone square remains a favorite venue for flower-vendors and itinerant artists. [SEP] The old stone buildings were designed to beat the harsh winters with distintive, tall, steep-sloping roofs to keep the weighty snow and ice from accumulating. [SEP] Across the rue Notre-Dame, the 19th-century Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) is built in the imposing style of the French Renaissance.

[SEP] Originally an Anglo stronghold, part of it is still known even among French speakers as Upper-Outremont, family home of that splendidly ambiguous French-Canadian, prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. [SEP] The “lower” part of this independent township has a breezy street-life, especially among the sidewalk cafés on rue Bernard. [SEP] And where have all the Anglos gone? [SEP] Many of the upper-middle-class variety are holding out in Westmount. [SEP] This bastion of the old Montréal élite of British origin became a prime target for the more violent members of the separatist Front de libération du Québec, who in the 1960s set off bombs in Westmount’s mailboxes. [SEP] Those not put off by this can still be seen in tweeds and cavalry twill,	walking	their dogs around Summit Park, where the Belvedere affords a fine view of the city. [SEP] Head for the tree-lined Summit Road, Summit Crescent, and Summit Circle and you’ll spot their ivy-covered mansions and grey-stone turreted châteaux half-concealed behind trees and shrubbery at the top of a grassy slope.

[SEP] Modern shipping and the advent of the railways crippled its port activities, and the city now lives from the service industries of tourism and provincial government administration. [SEP] For the best view of the city’s spectacular location, cross over to the St. Lawrence River’s south bank and take the ferry (traversier) from the suburb of Lévis. [SEP] Otherwise head through the airy but unexceptional modern city to the historic center of Old Québec, where the fortified Upper and Lower Town stand at the top and bottom of Cap Diamant, linked by a steep road and funicular railway. [SEP] Apart from the Citadel and Battlefields Park, every sight worth seeing is within easy	walking	distance, though you may like to try a 45-minute ride in a horse-drawn calèche (from the Parc de l’Esplanade).

Lake Louise The fairytale setting of this blue, blue lake with its monumental railway hotel, Château Lake Louise, has made it the mecca of thousands of sightseers every year. [SEP] The village (3 km/2 miles east) is very much a tourist-trap, but the lake (named after a daughter of Queen Victoria) and its surroundings retain their magic. [SEP] From the hotel terrace, before breakfast and the first crowds, look out onto the pine trees and snowy peaks of Fairview mountain to the south and the Beehive to the north, with the dazzling white Victoria glacier producing startling reflections on the shimmering surface of the lake. [SEP] Give the mob the slip by	walking	along clearly marked paths to the far end of the lake, with some pleasant teahouses on the way. [SEP] The path continues to the Plain of Six Glaciers, requiring more stamina. [SEP] Take the mountain road 14 km (81/2 miles) south to Moraine Lake — nice drive, wonderful all-day hike — to view the sawtooth skyline of the Valley of the Ten Peaks and the exhilarating climax of the lake’s clear turquoise waters.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
Antiques. [SEP] From fossils to ancient coins, Chinese customs regulations prohibit the export of any cultural relics except those marked with special wax seals; and only fairly recent objects are given the seal. [SEP] Even so, browsing is fascinating. [SEP] Remember that many knowledgeable buyers will have preceded you. [SEP] The authorities here peg prices to international levels. [SEP] Bamboo products. [SEP] In the southern regions where bamboo grows, cottage industries turn out bamboo tea boxes, fans, flutes, chopsticks,	walking	sticks, and furniture. [SEP] Brocades and silk. [SEP] Since the Han Dynasty, China has been exporting delicate silk fabrics in brilliant colors. [SEP] These days you can buy inexpensive raw silk by the meter or exquisite brocades, as well as silk scarves, ties, and blouses.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhatToDo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
If possible, familiarize yourself with the plot in advance. [SEP] Ideologically uplifting operas were the only ones permitted during the Cultural Revolution; classical stories were banned. [SEP] But today both classical and modern works are presented. [SEP] If you have an interpreter at hand, you’ll understand why some scenes animate the audience and others don’t. [SEP] The words of the songs are projected onto screens alongside the proscenium arch to clarify the nuances of a tonal language set to music. [SEP] Apart from the set pieces, most of the music is percussive and serves to support and reflect the action and mood. [SEP] Props are minimal and the action is subtle: an actor closes an invisible door with a mime gesture, and anyone	walking	with a riding crop must be understood to be mounted on a horse. [SEP] But the heroic characters couldn’t ever be mistaken for the snarling villains.

Some of Beijing’s few walkable areas are its chief shopping streets and markets. [SEP] Wangfujing, running north a few blocks east of the Forbidden City, is the capital’s primary shopping street, lined with upscale boutiques and glittering shopping plazas, although a few venerable arts and crafts shops, small galleries, and old department stores still survive. [SEP] South of Tiananmen Square, Liulichang Street has been restored to its Ming Dynasty appearance and is a shopper’s delight. [SEP] Liulichang, Beijing’s premier antiques market, extends eastward into Dazhalan Street, a pedestrian mall famous for silk and jewelry shops. [SEP] Outdoor markets, where visitors must bargain at length, are another	walking	adventure. [SEP] Silk Alley, the most famous and most overpriced, specializes in designer fashions. [SEP] More clothes and furs are found at Yabao Market, near Ritan Park (popularly known as the Russian Market). [SEP] The Hongxiao Market, near the Temple of Heaven, features clothing, crafts, and freshwater pearls. [SEP] The most colorful market is Panjiayuan (know as the Dirt Market), starting at sunrise every Sunday, with its stalls of collectibles, antiques, family treasures, tomb art, Tibetan rugs, furniture, and Mao memorabilia.

Most of the desert is grey and menacing, a sea of gravel out of which stark rocky mountains occasionally appear. [SEP] But everybody’s dream desert can be seen a few kilometers south of Dunhuang. [SEP] With oases in sight, awesome dunes rise in waves to 250-m (800-ft) crests. [SEP] As the sun and clouds move, the colors and textures of the sand hills change. [SEP] Hidden between the hills is a small, clear lake — Crescent Moon Lake (Yueyahu). [SEP] It’s not a mirage. [SEP] Reeds grow at the edge of this cool blue spring and tiny fish swim in it. [SEP] You can reach the lake from the edge of the desert on the back of a camel or (if you like	walking	in sand) on foot. [SEP] Twenty minutes each way should do it. [SEP] Beside the pool is a magnificent pavilion tower with a teahouse. [SEP] For a rare desert experience, climb to the top of a dune and listen to the musical — or thunderous — sound as the sand slides down. [SEP] This is the same sound Marco Polo heard when he passed this way on his own camel caravan 700 years ago.

Hangzhou is also renowned for its silks. [SEP] The Hangzhou Silk and Satin Printing and Dyeing Complex is the largest in China. [SEP] Tours follow the production process from the sorting of cocoons, which arrive by barge in 20-kg (44-pound) sacks, to the silk-screen printing stage. [SEP] At the end of the line is a shop where foreign visitors, exploiting their newly gained expertise, browse through the bolts of silk. [SEP] Other museums with tours and shops are devoted to traditional Chinese medicines and pottery. [SEP] The lakeside promenade also provides plenty of shopping and small restaurants. [SEP] But the essence of Hangzhou is its scenery. [SEP] The lake and hills afford some of the most scenic	walking	and bicycling of any city in China.

The mighty Songhua River, running through Harbin from west to east, inevitably attracts tourists. [SEP] In summer months there are sightseeing launches and, for the brave, swimming. [SEP] On the south bank, Stalin Park (Jiangpan Gongyuan) is a wide, inviting promenade, with its Flood Control Monument the chief focal point for visitors and vendors. [SEP] Visible from shore is Sun Island (Tai Yangdao), in the middle of the river, a mixture of health resorts, beach installations, and gardens. [SEP] It now boasts Siberia Tiger Park, a large animal preserve where endangered tigers, dodging tourist buses, train to hunt live prey before their release into the wild. [SEP] The main	walking	district, the cobblestone Daoli Old Town, bordered by Stalin Park, retains much of Harbin’s Russian heritage in its onion-domed architecture. [SEP] Other attractions include the inactive but spectacular Santa Sophia Church and two active temples. [SEP] Sixth-century stone tablets grace Wenmiao, Harbin’s temple to Confucius, while Jilesi, the Temple of Bliss (the largest in the province) hosts an active community of monks and nuns and opens onto a large, lively street market. [SEP] One of the darker attractions is the Exhibition Hall for the Ruins of the Japanese Troops Invading China, site of a secret biological warfare center set up by the occupying Japanese forces in 1939. [SEP] Its existence was hidden until the 1980s.

Walking and Hiking This is an ideal island to put on your	walking	boots and take to the countryside. [SEP] You will be well-rewarded, with small remote villages, hidden churches, and a rural lifestyle to explore. [SEP] Though Cretans are bemused as to why anyone would want to hike without any purpose but the pleasure of it, they have a genuine welcome for travelers on foot. [SEP] Itineraries can range from easy flat short walks to steep mountain hikes, though it’s not advisable to head into the high peaks without a guide. [SEP] Gorge walks are particularly popular; the Samariá is the busiest and the longest. [SEP] Other gorge walks include Imbros near Samariá, and the Valley of the Dead at Zákros on the eastern coast. [SEP] The peninsulas off the northwest coast present dramatic and interesting walks.

Lake Voulisméni is connected to the sea by an artificial channel. [SEP] Across the road bridge at its mouth is the main tourist office, and beyond are the harbor and port. [SEP] Sea breezes here often make this stroll cooler than around the lake. [SEP] From the port you can take caïque (small colorful wooden boats) trips to nearby attractions, most notably Spinalónga Island. [SEP] You won’t be able to explore Ágios Nikólaos without	walking	up a few hills. [SEP] There are shops selling up-market goods such as leather and fur coats around the harborside and along Odós Skafianáki, to the west of the harborfront. [SEP] Or take Odós Koundoúrou to Plateía Venizélos for more typical Cretan souvenirs like honey and ceramics. [SEP] The Archaeological Museum found at the top of Odós K. Paleólogou is worth a visit. [SEP] It has a good collection of Minoan artifacts presented in chronological order. [SEP] You will be able to view a sarcophagus with skeleton still in place, and the Goddess of Mírtos, a libation vessel dating from the 2nd millennium b.c. in the shape of a woman with a long neck and squat body. [SEP] A later Roman find is the skull of Potamós, decorated with a crown of gold olive leaves.

Chaniá was capital of Crete from 1845 until 1971 and it remains the island’s second largest settlement, with a great deal of urban development. [SEP] However, at its heart is a delightful old town replete with Venetian and Ottoman buildings and full of cosmopolitan atmosphere, considered to be one of the most beautiful towns in the whole of Greece. [SEP] The old town was once enclosed by high curtain walls; though today only the western curtain and Shiavo-Lando Bastion survive. [SEP] It’s well worth	walking	down Odós Pireós to examine the wall from beyond the protective ditch, to gain an impression of how the city used to look. [SEP] The Venetian harbor draws visitors and locals alike. [SEP] It is huge by comparison with Réthymnon and has an outer and inner section. [SEP] The harborfront is lined with beautiful medieval buildings and numerous cafés and tavernas making it the place for the evening volta or stroll. [SEP] The faded stucco of the harbor buildings takes on a delicate rosy hue as night falls, contrasting with the deep blue sky. [SEP] On the northwest corner of the outer harbor is Firkás Tower, a restored section of the Venetian ramparts, which now houses the Naval Museum (Naftikó Mousío) displaying fine model ships, maps, and naval paraphernalia.

[SEP] Luckily, throughout old Kathmandu, there are now signposts to let you know what neighborhood or square you are in, so with the help of a good map you can orient yourself by a few major landmarks. [SEP] Finding hidden gems down narrow lanes and dark alleys is one of the great rewards of exploring Kathmandu on foot. [SEP] Organized tours rarely penetrate these corners.

KathmanduValley Just minutes away from the heart of Kathmandu, life goes on as it has for centuries in the rural communities of the valley. [SEP] Most of the network of driveable roads is less than 40 years old. [SEP] Before that there were few cars in Nepal. [SEP] In the valley, at least the main street of principal villages is paved and accessible by taxi and bus, though the slower pace of	walking	or cycling is the most pleasant way to enter this world where time seems to have stopped. [SEP] Farmland begins at the very edge of the cities, and the fields are full of activity whatever the season. [SEP] Rice needs lots of water, so the paddy (the shoots are grown from seed) is transplanted when the June rains flood the fields. [SEP] This is a job for the women, who work in lines to space the young plants in neat rows. [SEP] In summer the rice forms a green velvety blanket, then turns golden in autumn when it ripens and is harvested. [SEP] This brings out the whole valley in force, everyone bending low with small sickles to cut the stalks, then stacking these in sheaves for fuel or thatch after the rice is threshed.

so flights from Kathmandu to Bhairawa, the nearest airfield, with a bus service to Lumbini.) [SEP] The story goes that Buddha’s mother gave birth to him under a tree in a garden at Lumbini, unable to get back in time to the palace, some 20 km (12 miles) away. [SEP] Marking the spot is a pillar commemorating the visit in 250 b.c. of the Indian emperor Ashoka, a zealous convert to Buddhism. [SEP] Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world come to Lumbini, and in recent years the site has been developed into an international cultural and religious park with several hotels and numerous Buddhist temples built by the world’s various Buddhist countries. [SEP] Although few tourists stray from the Kathmandu-Pokhara-Chitwan focal points, it is possible to see something of the undeveloped west without	walking	three weeks to get there. [SEP] There are now several lodges at Royal Bardia National Park on the Karnali River. [SEP] This park was created specifically as a preserve for tigers, which, with a little luck, can be seen here more easily than at Chitwan National Park. [SEP] Elephant rides, jungle walks and drives, river rafting, and bird-watching keep visitors busy. [SEP] The Karnali gorge above Chisopani is especially beautiful and is noted for the size of the fighting mahseer carp taken by sport fishermen.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
Golf. [SEP] If you’ve just got to play golf on your business trip to Warsaw, head for the First Warsaw Golf and Country Club (Rajszew 70; Tel. 782 45 55; <golfclub@it.com.pl>), an 18-hole course about 30 km (19 miles) outside of the capital. [SEP] Perhaps the best golfing is near the Baltic Sea, at the Gdansk Golf and Country Club in Postolów (Tel. 682 83 71). [SEP] Hiking and Walking. [SEP] The vast countryside of Poland is ideal for leisurely	walking	and more athletic hiking. [SEP] One of the best areas for both, and especially for serious hikers, are the High Tatra mountains around Zakopane. [SEP] Horseback-riding. [SEP] Equestrian holidays are increasingly popular in Poland; ask your travel agent about Orbis horseback-riding vacations. [SEP] If you just want to get in the saddle a time or two, contact: Pa-ta-Taj Horse-Riding School (Szkola Jazdy Konnej) (ul. Krótka 9, Tel. 758 58 35) or Sport and Recreation (Limanki, 26 Luze, Tel. 792 08 42) in Warsaw.

Tennis. [SEP] Major hotels tend to have their own tennis courts, but there are tennis clubs and public courts as well. [SEP] Many golf clubs also have their own courts.

[SEP] Another famous center is run by David Lloyd at Clube de Ténis Rocha Brava near Carvoeiro. [SEP] The Estoril Tennis Club is another excellent center. [SEP] Walking.

mid 1700s to allow pedestrian access to the town below. [SEP] The 99 Steps are the longest in town, but whoever named the flight must have become tired toward the end and miscounted — there are in fact 103. [SEP] Before climbing the steps, make a small detour farther along Kongens Gade, past the Lutheran Parsonage (1725), to reach Government House, an archetypal colonial mansion. [SEP] Now the office for the Governor of the USVIs, this 1867 structure was originally used for meetings of the Danish Colonial Council; it was totally renovated in 1974. [SEP] Nearby is Seven Arches House Museum, once the home of a Danish master craftsman. [SEP] The house has a “welcoming arms” staircase — fashionable in the 18th century — leading to the entrance. [SEP] Renovated and filled with period furniture,	walking	through it is a step back in time. [SEP] Retrace your route to the 99 Steps and climb to the summit of Government Hill. [SEP] At the top, just when you may feel in need of a rest, you’ll find Haagensen House, another renovated period property. [SEP] Its original owner, Hans Haagensen, was a Danish banker. [SEP] Those who don’t want to climb the steps can take a shuttle to Haagensen House from the Pampered Pirate gift shop on Norre Gade. [SEP] The remains of Blackbeard’s Castle — said to be the home of the famous pirate, whose real name was Edward Teach — can also be seen here.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
Any place built on pleasing vacationers is bound to have its share of nocturnal attractions. [SEP] Along Pacific Mexico, the options are as varied as the towns themselves, ranging from the dazzling discos of Acapulco to the quaint weekly “dances” on dirt floors in Barra de Navidad. [SEP] Puerto Vallarta is making a name for itself with its vast selection of live music. [SEP] One stretch of street — Ignacio L. Vallarta, just across the southbound bridge — is known as Rockin’ Row, for its eclectic collection of clubs. [SEP] Within easy	walking	distance from one another, you’ll find a blues club, a Harley-Davidson-theme rock n’ roll club, a salsa dance club, live mariachi music, a glitzy gay club (with nightly leather ranch-hands’ show), an alternative dance club, and a sports bar. [SEP] Still, the malecón rules when it comes to sheer rowdy nighttime fun. [SEP] Along with the longstanding Carlos O’Brians, several open-air bars and dance clubs stay open until 5am, and a new Cuban restaurant-bar pleases patrons with authentic food and live music nightly until 3am. [SEP] Just a few blocks in back of the malecón are a growing collection of unique clubs with a more urban edge. [SEP] Among them is La Cantina, a hipper version of a Mexican classic.

Yelapa and the Southern Beaches A boat ride away from Vallarta, Yelapa offers a Robinson Crusoe–style getaway for day trips or overnight stays. [SEP] No electricity and no roads keep it a secluded, funky beach community, populated in part by ex-pats and artists. [SEP] The other south shore beaches are Las Animas and Quimixto, appropriate for day trips only. [SEP] These two offer palapa beach dining, and as tropical a setting as you can dream up. [SEP] Las Animas has the better beach for swimming and sunning, but Quimixto has a beautiful waterfall that you can reach by	walking	about 30 minutes inland along a well-marked trail. [SEP] The coves surrounding Quimixto are also noted by divers and snorkelers for their excellent underwater vistas.

Also near the zócalo are the most authentic shopping experiences — the Mercado de Artesanías (Crafts Market) and the Mercado Municipal, which sells fresh and prepared food. [SEP] Just up the hill behind the zócalo, about ten minutes	walking	time, is La Quebrada, home of the famed cliff-divers. [SEP] Although the midday and sunset shows are impressive, the most popular exhibitions take place after dark, when the cliff divers plunge from this 130-foot cliff while holding flaming torches. [SEP] Just around the bend from La Quebrada is Playa La Angosta, a sheltered and often deserted cove. [SEP] However, Caleta and Caletilla, coves located south of the zócolo on the Peninsula de las Playas, are the most popular public beaches in Acapulco. [SEP] They are colorful sites, with palapa-topped beach restaurants, bright-hued passenger boats, water sports–equipment rental stands, and fishermen selling their fresh catch to beachgoers.

Playa Marinero extends from the central beach to the rocky outcropping, Rocas del Morro, that marks the beginning of Zicatela and its impressive waves. [SEP] Along Marinero, several rustic restaurants offer beach chairs and a place to pass the day while enjoying cool drinks and fresh seafood. [SEP] Puerto Angelito and Playa Manzanillo share the same sheltered cove, but are separated by a rocky outcropping. [SEP] Located just west of town, they are accessible by	walking	from town along a dirt road, or by a launch taxi boat from the main beach. [SEP] Here, the surf subsides enough for comfortable swimming, and hammock and palapa shade rentals are available. [SEP] This is Puerto Escondido’s best spot for snorkeling. [SEP] The main street for dining and nightlife is the one fronting Zicatela beach, Avenida del Morro. [SEP] Increasingly, attention is turning to this area, where there are clean, inexpensive bungalow-style hotels, cafés that feature cheap, surfer-size breakfasts, cyber-stations for checking e-mail, and abundant beach bars with extended happy hours.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	2
