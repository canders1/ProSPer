Alice had never been happy being the daughter of two of the Days. She regarded them- her parents, and all the days, in fact- with a semblance of disdain. The night was the only thing that interested her. She was secretive. Two days before her 13th birthday, her parents, Dawn and Morning Tea, as she called her mother, took her to the Wayward Diviner, as was customary for children of the Days. The Wayward Diviner had no doubt in his mind. He told Alice’s parents who she was to be the heir of as soon as they walked through the door. But they didn’t believe him. They told him to spin the Bone Wheel, so they could see for themselves. They thought he had made a mistake. The Diviner makes no mistakes.

The penguin ran to the shore and dove into the water. Grabbing me by the fin, he swam me to the shore and plopped me down onto the ground. I couldn’t breathe.

I went online and first checked if my favorite ficlet author wrote a sequel to his story. I read and commented it, then checked my Myspace and had a ton of new friend requests from people in school. I accepted them all, and organized them on my ‘top’. Jared was online and I decided to check his profile, and saw that I was already on his top..his first. I didnt think it was a big deal, so I ignored it, leaving him where he was on mine. He later messaged me asking if I had fun and all that day. I answered him, laughing in delight, when he suddenly replied “Hey, why arent i first on your top?” Well, i did have other friends I thought. Plus, I just met him right? He was the one putting me on his top so quickly, so I didnt answer, baffled by what to say. He messaged me again, asking to hang out with me again.

Strange things have always happened to my family. It came in through my mother's blood; my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories, bylichkas, of ancestors with the "second sight", stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks, and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times. When I asked her if she'd ever seen them – before I was old enough to stop believing, I mean – she would always look sad and tell me, "No, not since the family came to America has anything happened to us. But if you ever should see a faerie, tell him that you are of the blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly." As I got older, I shook the tales off with a nod and a "Yes, Nana."<n>I got older and went to school, then to college, and I replaced the dreams my Nana gave me with the music DJs mixed for crowds in clubs, webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything.

She raised an eyebrow. “Are you? Well, we don’t get many customers asking about that item.

After this, we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside.<n>“Excuse me,” I said, ignoring Nepthys’ warning look, “but may I ask what is kept in these rooms?”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
He thought about it, then handed me the pouch. I undid the strings and let the pouch sit on my palm so that I could see the stone inside. It looked like a normal river stone, a gray oval with a white stripe through it. As long as I looked at it, it didn’t reveal any magic sparkle or glow.<n>Suddenly, what looked like a little kid darted out of an alley and almost ran into me. I almost tripped over him, and the stone went flying out of the pouch. Nepthys tried to grab it, but, by reflex, I caught it first.<n>Immediately, I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid. “Nathan,” said Nepthys, “I think that you just did something very stupid.”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
The dark glow began to flicker, and Isis’ frown of concentration became one of worry. The pools in her hands grew deeper. She didn’t shed a bead of sweat, and I didn’t even see her draw a breath, but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame. Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake. The blood in her palms, still filling up, began to ripple. Shivers swept through her body, and Nepthys reached out to touch her but I stopped him. He glanced at me with honest concern, probably the first honest moment he’d shown me: ‘Is she all right?’ I didn’t know.<n>Her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out, splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs. She gasped and the dark glow went out, taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam. Isis collapsed on the fur, strings cut.<n>Now Nepthys lunged forward, took her by the arms. “Isis, what happened? Are you hurt?”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
A black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral. The vault rose into obscurity above me, and a massive rose window stood ahead of me. The panes looked dyed black, and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter. Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber, and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere. I couldn’t tell how many people were running, much less where they were. On the steps in front of the altar, I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and two other women. Then I heard Nepthys shout, “Nathan! Behind you!” I whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head, leaping like a panther. He smashed into the pews behind me and I heard him leap across the rest of the row. There was Nepthys, on the other side of the pews, holding the wooden box in his hand. He tossed it to me, and I just barely had it open before I saw the vampire again, turning to face me.<n>I pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes. He leapt over the pews, soaring like a grasshopper, and drew a gleaming knife in midair. I dodged, but he tossed it, and I held the box in front of my face. The blade lodged in the wood, its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin. My arms shook from the force of his throw. Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand. His first move pulled out the dagger, almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box, and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards. I dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer, ready to drive the ash spike into his heart. Behind him, I saw Nepthys running between the pews. I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me. I raised the stake; he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine. The stake went down, there was a blur, and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw.<n>Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant, then all went numb. Taste, hearing and touch became a single blur, and I do not know if my eyes were open. My mind began to dissipate, but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said, “This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking.” Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt

He then quickly wrote out a prescription, handed it to her and said, "There you are. Of course, if that doesn't work, then we'll just have to have you put to sleep."<n>	#jokes#	jokes_jokes11.txt

This 85 year old couple, having been married almost 60 years, had died in a car crash. They had been in good health the last ten years, mainly due to her interest in health food and exercise. When they reached the pearly gates, St. Peter took them to their mansion which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen and master bath suite and Jacuzzi. As they "oohed and aahed" the old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost. "It's free," Peter replied, "this is Heaven."<n>Next they went out back to survey the championship golf course that the home backed up to. They would have golfing privileges everyday and each week the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. The old man asked, "What are the green fees?" Peter's reply, "This is heaven, you play for free."<n>Next they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine's of the world laid out. "How much to eat?" asked the old man. "Don't you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!" Peter replied with some exasperation.<n>	#jokes#	jokes_jokes14.txt

He searched all over Paris seeking a suitable place to raise his rabbits.

am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-storey building. When I completed my work, I found I had some bricks left over, which, when weighed later, were found to be slightly in excess of 500lbs.<n>Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor. Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, I swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks.<n>You will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135lbs. Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed. This explains the fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3 of the accident report form. Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley.<n>	#jokes#	jokes_jokes1.txt

If the workforce at large can learn, what are the social arrangements that best sustain new learning? Leaving the determination of what is to be learned to a few senior managers? Knowing what is best for people or trusting that they might know, or at least contribute to knowing, what is best for themselves? Having people trapped by deferred rewards (Williamson, 1975), or acknowledging that those rewards systems are grounded in distrust?<n>A colleague recently visited the Czech republic, and explored that country’s relatively rapid adjustment to a market economy. She asked what was the single best thing a Czech worker could do to learn the underlying principles of the market. ‘Work for McDonalds,’ went the surprising reply, ‘but only for six months.’ It was explained that six months was quite long enough for the uninitiated worker to appreciate the importance of customers and customer service. After six months, the worker had learned what he or she could and it was time, from a career perspective, to move on.<n>The contrast between working for McDonalds for six months or working for McDonalds for a lifetime is, writ large, the contrast between boundaryless careers and their traditional bounded counterparts. Today’s work is increasingly ‘intelligent’ work (Quinn, 1992), that calls on workers’ learning capacities, and – as our examples suggest – provides an organising structure rich in project opportunities through which learning episodes can unfold. If that organising structure is lacking, the worker can heed the advice of our Czech informant and design a project for herself or himself.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_CUP2.txt
