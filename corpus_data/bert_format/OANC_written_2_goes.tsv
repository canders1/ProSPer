sumer base of the retailer, the larger the number of individual products typically measured in stockkeeping units (SKUs).2 [SEP] This variety is portrayed in Table 3.1, which shows the number of SKUs provided annually by different types of retailers over the course of a year. [SEP] The number of SKUs can range from just 10,000 for a discount food store like Costco, which offers a limited number of products sold in large quantities, to more than two million different items in an upscale department store. [SEP] Today retailers must manage this profusion of products. [SEP] At an operational level, this means deciding what types and how many of any one good it should stock to maximize sales per square foot of available space—one of the most critical measures of retail performance. [SEP] If all	goes	well, retailers allocate space to different goods efficiently, responding to shifts in consumer tastes (stocking the hits and discontinuing flops); setting pricing policies (markups and markdowns) to deal with both the direct cost of goods and the nature of consumer demand; and controlling inventory to reduce exposure to risk.

tilization of 89.66 percent. [SEP] The equivalent production marker made by the manufacturer’s highly skilled operator, using a computer but without HCTAR’s software, achieved a utilization of 89.54 percent, or just a little less than the fully automatic software system. [SEP] Sometimes a human operator can beat the automatic system by a small amount, but the following example is typical. [SEP] The production marker for the intimate apparel item in Figure 8.2 was initially laid out by a trained operator with 79.96 percent utilization; the HCTAR software compacted the marker and achieved cloth utilization of 81.54 percent, an improvement of 1.47 percent. [SEP] One-third of the wholesale price of apparel is typically fabric cost. [SEP] A 1 percent savings in fabric over the entire production	goes	directly to the bottom line. [SEP] Such savings can add up to many millions of dollars for large manufacturers. [SEP] Based on our survey results, about two-thirds of the business units in 1992 generated markers by trained operators with computer assistance; when the survey response is weighted by dollars of yearly sales, however, 99.5 percent of the business units’ production came from computer-generated markers. [SEP] In contrast, apparel operations in developing nations generally do not use computerized layout systems. [SEP] Markers are made by hand, tracing pattern pieces onto sheets of paper from thick, pre-cut cardboard pattern elements. [SEP] The primary alignment tool is the meter stick for measuring distances from the edge.

[SEP] Regardless of which individual sewing operations are required, the operator must be trained and given practice time to achieve a quality product, at least at the standard production rates. [SEP] The time required for a new worker to achieve production standards, while maintaining quality, can range from days for the simplest operation to nearly a year for joining the sleeve to the body of a suit coat. [SEP] A few sewing operations are so demanding that some operators are never able to achieve the minimum acceptable production rate for them. [SEP] With different skill levels required for different operations, it is not surprising that piece rates vary with the difficulty of the operation.

The Lockstitch Machine Almost all home machines are lockstitch machines. [SEP] The top thread comes from a spool or cone of thread above the machine and	goes	through many thread guides, a thread tensioner, a take-up arm, and, finally, the needle. [SEP] The bottom thread is wound on a bobbin, a small spool, that is below the needle and the sewing surface. [SEP] To make a stitch, the needle with the top thread is plunged through the plies of fabric, and a loop of the top thread is formed below the surface of the stitch plate (often called a “throat plate”).5 [SEP] The loop of top thread is passed over the bobbin and around its thread. [SEP] The take-up arm then pulls up the top thread to set a stitch. [SEP] The top and bottom threads are locked together by passing the loop of the top thread around the bobbin.

[SEP] Delays in product flow can result from machine problems, worker absence, or if priority is given to special orders. [SEP] In some plants, the carts may contain up to a day’s worth of work. [SEP] Although this may appear to be a crude way of keeping track of the work flow, it is simple and generally effective. [SEP] Still, work almost never progresses in perfect lockstep through a factory. [SEP] Finding the correct parts for a shirt can often involve a hunt through the plant. [SEP] For example, a worker might accidentally leave a bundle of unfinished work in the cart when it	goes	back to be loaded again. [SEP] Because a worker may have a day’s work in the carts in front of her, it is easy to see how individual bundles of parts can be misplaced—which, in turn, will hold up the assembly of some SKUs. [SEP] Partially finished shirts and shirt subassemblies will then be in a number of places in the factory. [SEP] This shirt factory employs 250 workers.

r inﬂuences—and is inﬂuenced by—the others. [SEP] Therefore, the roles of heredity and environment, of the child and important people in his or her life, so closely interconnect that according to some experts, their inﬂuence is inseparable.56 [SEP] To illustrate, let’s take two vibrant, contemporary research topics relevant to young children’s learning: (1) the dramatic growth of the brain during the ﬁrst 6 years, and (2) young children’s temperaments, or genetically inﬂuenced styles of relating to their physical and social worlds. [SEP] brain development. [SEP] Many people think of infancy and early childhood as a time when the human brain is especially sensitive to experience. [SEP] In line with this view, although genes provide the code for basic brain structures and functions, heredity	goes	only so far in aecting the organization of the child’s brain and the rate at which it develops. [SEP] The environment has a crucial, profound impact. [SEP] How does early experience join with biology to aect brain development?

[SEP] Appropriate stimulation “wires” the brain, prompting it to form new connections and its regions to specialize. [SEP] As this process	goes	forward, the brain gradually becomes receptive to increasingly complex and varied stimulation. [SEP] This fosters further elaboration and specialization of brain structures and ever more advanced knowledge and skills. [SEP] temperament.   [SEP] From the earliest ages, children vary greatly in preferences, interests, talents—and in temperament, or style of emotional responding, the most thoroughly studied of these sources of individual variation. [SEP] Temperament encompasses activity level, ability to attend to stimuli, and capacity to adjust the intensity of emotions to a comfortable level so the child can remain adaptively engaged with his or her physical and social surroundings.64	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
 three legs at night?) The answer is man, who as a child, in the “morning” of life, crawls on four legs; as an adult walks on two legs; and as an old man uses a cane for support, thus walking on three legs. [SEP] Another example is a “true riddle,” which is a comparison of something to the unknown answer, and that something is described in the question. [SEP] For example, “Tengo ojos y no miro; boca pero no hablo; qué soy?” (I have eyes and cannot see; a mouth, but cannot speak; What am I?) The answer is a photograph. [SEP] Another type of riddle is the conundrum, where the answer is contained in the riddle itself, such as “Agua pasa por mi casa cate de mi corazon” (Water passes by my house pain of my heart).

Altars An altar is a religious shrine (depending on its size, sometimes called an altarcito, a little altar) established in the home for the personal worship by the family. [SEP] Home altars are common in many Mexican and Chicano homes. [SEP] The word altar is derived from the Latin word altare, a combination of altus, high, and ara, altar, referring to a raised structure for worship, one that	goes	upward toward the sky or heaven. [SEP] It provides a space where religious people can communicate with God, the saints, or other spiritual beings. [SEP] Home altars vary in size, from a small shelf with one votive candle and one saint or statue, to a large table altar, with many religious images, La Virgen de Guadalupe, flowers, pictures of saints, candles; a structure that can fill up half a room. [SEP] Permanent altars can be in a small nicho (niche) in the bedroom, the living room, or even the dining room. [SEP] Daily devout prayer, such as reciting the rosary or praying to a patron or favorite saint, is a normal occurrence in many families, with the prayers often led by the mother or grandmother.

[SEP] This song was collected in southern California and according to Hague, the “words date from 1848 or about that time” (109). [SEP] It is an example of a folk custom the Mexicans used to convey their antipathy toward the Anglo culture.

[SEP] Called the “devil at the dance” legend or “devil haunts the dance hall” in folklore literature, it is considered to be an urban belief tale that has been adapted to contemporary situations. [SEP] The devil makes his appearance elegantly dressed, usually in a suit; he is strikingly handsome, muy suave (smooth and poised), tall, and refined. [SEP] Consequently, he stands out from among the rest of the men. [SEP] Besides his stunning appearance, he is always an amazing dancer, knows the latest dance steps, and selects the prettiest girl to dance.

“La Bamba” [SEP] The title of a song, as well as the title of a movie directed by Luis Valdez in 1987. [SEP] The film is about the life of the Chicano singer Ritchie Valens, who recorded the song and made it very popular in 1958. [SEP] The song actually	goes	back to early Mexican colonial history; it has been traced to 1790 when it was performed at the Coliseo Theatre in Mexico City. [SEP] There are printed sources that cite the song being sung and danced in Veracruz during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. [SEP] By the 1830s it was also a popular dance in Mexican California. [SEP] “La Bamba” is considered to be a son jarocho (country folks’ dancing music), an example of the mestizo (mixed-race) musical tradition, with strong African influences, from the state of Veracruz. [SEP] The instrumentation of the traditional son jarocho included a small harp, a small eight-string guitar (jarana), and a small four-string guitar (requinto). [SEP] The dance that went with son jarocho was a zapateado, a foot-stomping dance. [SEP] There are two 	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
mon. [SEP] Colorful plastic wreaths are sometimes attached to the wooden or cement cross. [SEP] Another dis-tinguishing feature in Chicano camposantos is the wide range of materials used in decorating a grave. [SEP] As with home yard shrines and home altars, everyday objects are used as personal and artistic statements. [SEP] It is often in the performance of highly charged personal rituals that people create folklore, folk art, and folk music. [SEP] Many grave markers are brightly painted, and some even have religious scenes painted on them. [SEP] This tradition has been linked to Mexico’s indigenous heritage, for, as Terry Jordan states, “Such use of color in a sacred context has ample pre-Columbian precedent in Mexico, where even the huge pyramids once bore bright paints” (80). [SEP] He	goes	on to say, “Hispanic graveyards are places of color, where paints, flowers, and tiles combine to comfort the bereaved and startle the gringo” (88).

[SEP] La Llorona, meaning “the weeping woman” or “the howling woman,” may be represented as an Indian woman, an ugly old witch, or a beautiful woman in white with long flowing hair. [SEP] She always appears late at night, and her crying and weeping can be vividly heard as she shrieks, “Ayyy, mis hijos!” (Oh, my children!). [SEP] According to the tragic legend, there once was a woman who was abandoned by her husband, or lover, and left with two or three children. [SEP] Angry and seeking revenge, she kills her children by throwing them into a river, or sometimes by other means. [SEP] When she realizes what she’s done, she	goes	insane. [SEP] She is condemned to spend eternity searching for her lost and dead children. [SEP] Consequently she is often heard in the night calling her children. [SEP] She frequents rivers and other bodies of water, and is sometimes seen floating above the water looking, searching for her children. [SEP] Her legend has been recited for over 300 years, and in contemporary times she is still believed to be wandering the streets in large cities, as well as in the small towns of the Southwest where numerous people report encounters with her. [SEP] At times she is seen as a beautiful woman, wearing a white dress, roaming back streets and country roads, crying and weeping.

[SEP] For instance accessories from different-year models are interchanged, such as side panels from a 1957 model may be cut and welded to a 1952 car, or “’57 Cadillac tail lamps on a ’62 Chevy Impala” (Bright, 196). [SEP] Low riders are usually young urban Chicanos, between the ages of eighteen and thirty, and there can be two and three generations of low riders in one family. [SEP] The cost of fixing and maintaining a low-rider car is fairly high, so the owner typically is a working person. [SEP] Since finding older cars, say from the 1950s, is becoming difficult, some low riders now customize small trucks, motorcycles, and bicycles as well. [SEP] The movie Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life) depicts the work that	goes	into customizing a pickup truck. [SEP] Cruising involves driving very slowly up and down city streets, such as Mission Street in San Francisco, Whittier Boulevard in Los Angeles, and King and Story Roads in San Jose, California. [SEP] The objective of cruising is to socialize, to see and be seen, to give others the opportunity to admire one’s car and to admire the other cars; consequently the driving must be very slow, muy despacito. [SEP] Driving a great customized car, beautifully painted, is a unique experience for the low rider.

such vows may be called promesas or mandas and can be fulfilled by prayers, pilgrimages, and promised visits to a saint’s shrine if the wish or favor is granted. [SEP] This is an important folk religious tradition common among Latinos and Chicanos in the Southwest, Mexico, and throughout Latin America. [SEP] A mother may make a promesa to La Virgen de Guadalupe, to visit her shrine in Guadalajara, if her daughter is cured of breast cancer. [SEP] When the promesa is fulfilled this mother may leave a tiny silver breast, a milagro, to symbolize the realization of the promesa. [SEP] Milagros are made out of wood, wax, or bone, but the most common material is silver or a silverlike metal, and they are usually very tiny objects, about one inch in diameter. [SEP] The custom of offerings to saints	goes	back hundreds of years and can be traced to the Mediterranean among pre-Christian Greeks, Romans, and Iberians. [SEP] The tradition as it has evolved in the New World is an amalgamation of African, Native American, and Spanish beliefs. [SEP] Saints are very important among Chicano Catholics, influencing every aspect of daily life and acting as mediators between man and God. [SEP] Promesas made to saints and the milagros presented are a reflection of their strong predominance in daily life. [SEP] In the Southwest, this custom has been documented since the colonial period and was undoubtedly introduced by the Spanish missionaries. [SEP] It is known that Hernán Cortés, the conqueror of Mexico, had a milagro made in the shape of a gold scorpion, which he offered to the patroness of his home, Ou	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
 not because a vow was made. [SEP] A retablo ex-voto is a work of art, a religious painting, and also a historical document. [SEP] The painting depicts the favor or miracle that occurred, the holy image or saint responsible for the miracle, and a short text that describes what occurred, including the location and date of the event. [SEP] The text describing the event may begin with “Doy Gracias” (I give thanks) and express a need to state the miraculous event and tell how at the moment of crisis “me encomendó a la Virgen” (I entrusted myself to the Virgin). [SEP] The text usually ends “por eso dedico este retablo” (this is why I dedicate this retablo). [SEP] The retablo is then placed in a church or a shrine devoted to that particular saint. [SEP] The tradition of creating votive paintings	goes	back hundreds of years in Mexico, and can be found along the U.S.-Mexican border region and in the cities of the Southwest. [SEP] Many people immigrating from Mexico, for instance, have painted or commissioned a retablo in gratitude for surviving a disaster or an illness. [SEP] Art exhibits in the United States have shown retablos ex-votos that depict the treacherous experience of immigrating to the United States.

layers are la mamá and “Saint Inez,” who may also be called La Vieja Inés (Old Lady Inés) or La Virgen Inés (Old Maid Inés). [SEP] All of the other players are given a color by the mamá: red, yellow, green, blue, or they may choose their own color. [SEP] La Vieja Inés comes and pretends to knock on the door, Tan, tan. [SEP] The mother asks, “Quién es?” [SEP] (Who is it?) [SEP] and the answer is “La Vieja Inés.” [SEP] The mother asks, “Que quieres?” [SEP] (What do you want?). [SEP] “Quiero colores” is the answer. [SEP] “Que color quieres?” [SEP] (What color do you want?) [SEP] “Quiero verde” (I want green), or any color is mentioned. [SEP] The little girl whose color is mentioned runs away and La Vieja Inés tries to catch her before she reaches a spot designated as home base. [SEP] The game	goes	on until all of the colors have been chosen and all of the girls are caught. [SEP] In some versions the girls carry ribbons, each of a different color. [SEP] Scholars who have analyzed the game point to the socialization of gender roles for little girls, and the game serves as a lesson in the inevitable eventual separation from the safety of home. [SEP] This was one of the games collected by the Federal Writers’ Program in New Mexico during the 1930s. [SEP] Although there were many games played by Hispano and Mexican children, this one appears to be one with a long historical tradition. [SEP] Jose Limón has written about a version found in Texas. [SEP] It is an ancient game that can be traced to medieval Spain, to a place called Zafra.

Yardas (Gardens) Although the Spanish word for garden is jardín, many Chicano families favor the term “yard” while referring to their gardens, pronouncing it in Spanish as yarda. [SEP] Although yarda appears to be a pochismo (Chicano slang), it can be found in Cassell’s Spanish Dictionary. [SEP] The layout and organizational aesthetics of Chicano yardas are unique enough that folklorists and cultural geographers have written about them. [SEP] Many yardas can aesthetically constitute yard art, even though it does not appear that this is the intent of the creator. [SEP] Besides planting shrubs, flowers, and sometimes grass, the gardener will bring into play the creativity that	goes	into decorating a yard unconsciously, with the result being a folk art display. [SEP] Invariably, a yard will contain many potted flowers arranged in a patterned manner. [SEP] The central focus of many yards is often a devotional shrine set up in memory of a family member, with a nicho housing a saint or Madonna, and the design of the yard’s plants and flowers is laid out in reference to the shrine. [SEP] Some yardas may not have planted grass, but instead hard-packed dirt that is kept free of weeds, swept frequently, and kept prepared for family gatherings. [SEP] But trees, preferably fruit trees, abound to make shade for family gatherings and outdoor cooking.

the time the amendment was enacted, it was fairly clear that the drafters and the public had a broad construction in mind, for the Thirteenth Amendment became the constitutional foundation in 1866 for the first Civil Rights Act—indeed, the Act that is still used today to prosecute those who, like the police who beat up Rodney King, engage in racially motivated deprivations of civil rights.17 [SEP] Because the deprivations of civil rights were understood to be an instantiation of relationships of unjust domination, it is clear that the framers envisioned a new constitutional order much broader than merely business as usual, just without slavery. [SEP] Academic writers have found the Thirteenth Amendment a rich source for constitutional speculation. [SEP] Some have claimed that the amendment	goes	so far as to require the government to be watchful and intervene against child abuse.18 [SEP] Others have argued that the amendment offers convincing grounds for recognizing abortion rights. [SEP] Requiring a mother to carry a child to term arguably amounts to an oppressive form of involuntary servitude.19 [SEP] A third voice holds, much in line with the argument of this book, that the potential ambit of “involuntary servitude” includes all forms of employment and labor that are unjust and oppressive.20 [SEP] These are imaginative readings, and others are possible.21 [SEP] Some restraint is necessary. [SEP] We have to be mindful of the prospect that the values of the Secret Constitution might play themselves out more effectively as the informal restraints of civil society rather than as bin	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
overnment had the duty to protect them. [SEP] The government also asserted its duty to protect the weak in the Prohibition Amendment, but, alas, the duty to help others is not always easily realized. [SEP] Yet, the idea that the government should protect the weak, that it should tender compassion for victims, became a mainstay of the Secret Constitution. [SEP] Of course, no one is constitutionally protected in the action of committing a crime. [SEP] The rights attach to those suspected of crime. [SEP] The purpose of the amendments is to insure both that innocent persons will not be convicted but just as critically to protect the dignity of every suspect as he or she falls under the investigative and prosecuting power of the state. [SEP] For example, the privilege against self-incrimination	goes	beyond the protection of the innocent to speak to the dignity of the suspect who may remain silent. [SEP] Similarly, the protection of the home and private papers often deters the efficiency of law enforcement, but only for the sake of promoting personal privacy. [SEP] So long as we recognize that the constitutional provisions are interlaced with dignity concerns, then we cannot properly disregard the claims of victims to be treated in the same way. [SEP] The victims’ rights movement focuses, therefore, on increasing the participation of victims in various stages of the process. [SEP] Participation itself helps enhance the dignity of the victim by allowing him or her to be heard and to feel respected as a citizen. [SEP] The most common problem faced by victims is that they are not allowed t	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
The Supreme Court has remained remarkably unaffected by the academic swing toward support for hate speech legislation. [SEP] In the R.A.V. case, for example, the Court struck down a municipal ordinance that punished the display of a symbol that one knows or has reason to know “arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.”21 Academic critics of the decision stress the value of regulating speech that has the effect, it is argued, of silencing minorities.22 [SEP] The overriding value, they claim, is the equality of those affected by hate speech. [SEP] Only by restricting intimidating speech, the argument	goes	, can all potential participants in the democratic dialogue feel free to speak and to make their opinions known. [SEP] In the courts, however, the ancien principles still reign. [SEP] The primary value is not equality but freedom.

There have been several responses to this issue, some raised prior to Smolin’s work. [SEP] One is based on a view of multiple universes and the “weak anthropic principle.” [SEP] This principle states that there exist multiple universes, but only those universes that were complex would sport life forms with the wit to wonder why their universe was complex. [SEP] So the very fact that we humans are here to wonder about this issue merely means that we happen to be in one of the complex universes among vastly many universes. [SEP] The argument is at least coherent. [SEP] But it’s hard to be thrilled by this answer. [SEP] The “strong anthropic principle”	goes	further  indeed, too far  and posits that, for mysterious reasons, the universe is contrived such that life must arise to observe it and wonder at it. [SEP] Few think the strong anthropic principle counts as science in any guise. [SEP] Smolin points out that there are two possible answers to the puzzle of the complexity of the universe. [SEP] Either we will find a parameter-free description  a kind of supertheory  that yields something like our complex universe with its constants, or some historical process must pick those constants. [SEP] Smolin proposes the possibility of “cosmic natural selection.” [SEP] Here, daughter universes are born of black holes. [SEP] Universes with more black holes will have more daughter universes.

Morowitz then considers the equilibrium ratio of chain-extending bonds to all bonds, chain-extending plus chain-terminating, that would occur as a function of temperature, or equivalently, the energy per unit volume of the system. [SEP] At very high temperatures, the system is a plasma, and chain-terminating bonds are vastly more predominant at equilibrium than chain-extending bonds. [SEP] At very low temperatures, chain-terminating bonds predominate overwhelmingly. [SEP] If one plots the equilibrium ratio of chain-extending bonds to all bonds as a function of temperature, or energy per unit volume, the curve	goes	up, reaches a single peak, then trends downward. [SEP] Thus, there is an optimal temperature, or energy per unit volume, where the equilibrium ratio of bonds maximizes the ratio of chain-extending chemical bonds to all bonds. [SEP] Morowitz’s remarkable conclusion is that the maximum of this curve, where chain-extending bonds are as abundant as possible at equilibrium, corresponds quite closely to the average energy per unit volume of the biosphere of the Earth! [SEP] Even if the calculation is crude, I find this result deeply interesting. [SEP] It suggests that, somehow, the biosphere has achieved an energy per unit volume such that at equilibrium chain-extending bonds are maximized. [SEP] But this means that the energy requirements to form a biosphere of high molecular diversity are minim	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
The wonderful result that Scott and friends showed is a phase transition from Ksat expressions that are almost certainly satisfiable to Ksat expressions that are almost certainly not satisfiable (Figure .).

[SEP] Obviously, as each variable is in more and more of the C clauses, with randomly assigned truth requirements, Vi versus not-Vi, the chance that the set of clauses can be jointly satisfied gets harder. [SEP] On the other hand, as K	goes	up, there are more variables per clause, any one of which, if satisfied, satisfies the clause since the variables within a clause are joined by “or.” [SEP] Thus, as K	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
tantly, it is easy to create systems that are not readily adaptable by mutation and selection. [SEP] What follows is not quite a theorem (and was discussed in At Home in the Universe), but it will do. [SEP] Many of the readers of this book are competent programmers. [SEP] Consider a typical program, say written in C, Java, or some other language. [SEP] Perhaps it computes something as simple as the square roots of the first two million integers. [SEP] Perhaps it simulates an ecosystem. [SEP] Whatever that program does, imagine trying to evolve it by making random mutations in the code. [SEP] We all know what would happen. [SEP] Most mutations of a computer program are of major eect. [SEP] The program won’t compile. [SEP] If it compiles, it generates some vast stream of symbolic nonsense or	goes	into an undetected infinite loop and “hangs.” [SEP] And we can make the matter substantially worse by eliminating redundancy in the code. [SEP] Any computer program can be written as a sequence of binary, and , symbols, where that sequence represents the input data to the program and the program itself.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
he landscapes of its neighbors. [SEP] Third, the critter can change the ruggedness of its landscape by increasing K or decreasing K. Landscapes become more rugged and multipeaked as K increases. [SEP] The move altering K is accepted only if that move makes the current genotype of the creature fitter. [SEP] Hence, altering the ruggedness of the fitness landscape must pay o for the creature immediately and is accepted selfishly. [SEP] The fourth thing that can happen is rather mean. [SEP] A random other creature, say, Godzilla, is chosen to attempt to invade the current species niche. [SEP] A copy of Godzilla, Godzilla’, connects to the first species’ ecosystem neighbors and has a go. [SEP] If Godzilla’ is fitter when coupled to the first species’ econeighbors than that species, that species	goes	extinct in its niche and is replaced by Godzilla’. [SEP] By the fourth mechanism, if Godzilla’ happens to have a beneficial landscape ruggedness due to its K value, that good landscape ruggedness has now replicated from the initial Godzilla to its copy. [SEP] So good landscape ruggedness can spread, by natural selection, through the model ecosystem, hence, landscape ruggedness can evolve.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
By the fourth mechanism, if Godzilla’ happens to have a beneficial landscape ruggedness due to its K value, that good landscape ruggedness has now replicated from the initial Godzilla to its copy. [SEP] So good landscape ruggedness can spread, by natural selection, through the model ecosystem, hence, landscape ruggedness can evolve. [SEP] The results are shown in Figure .. Indeed, landscape ruggedness does evolve to an intermediate ruggedness. During this evolution, the mean interval between extinction events increases dramatically, hence, the mean number of extinction events decreases. In this sense, all the creatures that remain become fitter due to the coevolutionary tuning of landscape ruggedness. In addition, when Godzilla’ replaces the hapless species that now	goes	extinct, its econeighbors find themselves interacting with Godzilla’ itself. They may not be as fit interacting with Godzilla’ as with the first species, hence, they too may be invaded and driven extinct in turn. In short, avalanches of extinction events can propagate. Figure . shows that the distribution is a power law, with many small and few large extinction events. Moreover, once a new species comes into existence, say, Godzilla’, it may not fare well in its new niche, hence, may go extinct soon. But if it lasts in its niche, it may be well adapted, hence, resistant to being driven extinct. The results (Figure .a) are a power law distribution of species lifetimes.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
This fact suggests that the optimal prediction of a short sequence of data is obtained by a model of intermediate complexity  a few Fourier modes, neither a single one nor very many. [SEP] The sense of bounded rationality Vince and I want to advocate is that optimal prediction of a limited time series is achieved with models using only a few Fourier modes, or their analogs in other basis sets  models of modest, or bounded, complexity. [SEP] The rest of the theory Vince and I have developed	goes	to show that agents who have theories of one another and act selfishly based on those theories will typically create a persistently changing pattern of actions. [SEP] Therefore, they persistently create a nonstationary world in which only the relatively recent past has valid data. [SEP] Thus, there is always only a limited amount of valid data on which to base theories, and the agents, in turn, must always build models of intermediate, bounded complexity to avoid over- or underfitting the meager valid data. [SEP] Natural rationality is, in this sense, bounded. [SEP] It is bounded because we mutually create nonstationary worlds. [SEP] What happens is that the agents act under their theories.

Heading east from the provincial capital of Faro, the first settlement of any size you will come to is the colorful fishing town of Olhão. [SEP] A working port, it has made few concessions to tourism and is full of character. [SEP] Olhão has often been described as the “little white Cubist town of the Algarve,” its architecture likened to that of North African towns. [SEP] That may have been the case some years ago, but modern development has strongly interfered with its once distinctive appearance. [SEP] You can judge for yourself by ascending the bell tower of the parish church (which also	goes	by the name of Nossa Senhora do Rosário), which you will find by winding your way through the narrow streets back to the Praça da Restauração (you may have to ask for access to the tower in the sacristy). [SEP] Founded by King Dom Pedro II in 1698, the church has an impressive, scroll-decorated Baroque façade, brilliant white dome, stone belltower, and a chapel at the rear, Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos (Our Lady of the Afflicted), where women often pray when their fishermen husbands are away at sea. [SEP] Instead of the red-tiled roofs and filigreed chimneys seen elsewhere in the Algarve, the Olhão skyline comprises flat-topped roofs of terraces called açoeitas. [SEP] Look hard and you can still see the narrow, outside staircases leading to white-washed towers, where fishermen’s wives, or perh	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
eciated by an afternoon strolling by them (see box page 66). [SEP] This part of town is still mostly residential and many houses have been converted into apartments for successful Amsterdammers. [SEP] It is fascinating to peek inside at the ultra-modern interiors, which give a feel of the flair the Dutch seem to have for interior design. [SEP] At number 605 Herengracht, Museum Willet-Holthuysen gives you the opportunity to look behind the façade of a genuine Golden Age house. [SEP] It was completed in 1690 and structurally has been altered very little since that time, although it has been changed cosmetically several times as fashions changed. [SEP] In 1855 it came into the possession of the Holthuysen family. [SEP] Pieter Holthuysen was a successful trader in glass and English coal (which	goes	to prove that you didn’t need to trade in exotic goods to become wealthy). [SEP] After the death of Pieter and his wife, the house is bequeathed to their daughter Louisa who later married Abraham Willet. [SEP] He had a love of art and was a founding member of the Royal Antiquarian Society — a society whose aim was to promote national art and history. [SEP] On her death in 1895 Louisa bequeathed the house and its contents to the city of Amsterdam on condition that it would be opened as a museum. [SEP] This it duly did in 1896. [SEP] You will be able to examine in detail the furniture, porcelain, and numerous artworks collected by the family. [SEP] Travel further along Herengracht to the end of the second block. [SEP] Here you will find one of the most fascinating views of the canal ring. [SE	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
North from Zea harbor is another pretty harbor, Mikrolimani (Small Harbor) or Tourkolimani, where you’ll find the fishing fleet and some good fish tavernas. [SEP] Or head south towards the main historical attractions of Piraeus. [SEP] From the south side of Zea harbor it is only a short walk to the Archaeological Museum of Piraeus. [SEP] The rather dour building hides a treasure-trove of statuary and other artifacts found during excavation of the ancient shrines of the city, and communal buildings such as the Agora. [SEP] Pride of place	goes	to the Piraeus Kouros, the oldest full-size bronze figure depicting the god Apollo. [SEP] On the grounds of the museum are scant remains of the ancient Theater of Zea. [SEP] Walking further south along the promenade past remnants of the ancient sea wall brings you to another small bay where you will find the Hellenic Maritime Museum, a semicircular museum with small garden in front complete with cannon. [SEP] Rooms display an eclectic series of artifacts with dioramas of the great Battle of Salamis in 480 b.c., letters from the naval heroes of Greek independence, and numerous items salvaged from the seas around the Attica coastline.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
Around the shoreline of San Salvador are four separate places that are purported to be the site of Columbus’s landing. [SEP] No one will ever know for sure, of course, but the competition continues. [SEP] After the Spaniards went on to other islands in the Caribbean, the island became a base for English pirate John Watling; indeed until 1926 it was known as Watling’s Island. [SEP] The interior of San Salvador is dotted with lakes; there is a great deal of marshy land and only one major road. [SEP] Cockburn Town (pronounced “KOE-burn”) is the capital. [SEP] Pride of place in the town	goes	to the small jail found by the main coast road. [SEP] It’s now a museum because, as one resident said, “we don’t have no need for no jail.” (The opening hours are irregular.) The main road leads around the circumference of the island. [SEP] Heading south from Cockburn Town you’ll first come to Long Bay, the “official” site of Columbus’s landing. [SEP] It is marked by a plain white cross that sits bright and stark against the azure-blue ocean on the seaward side of the road. [SEP] The area has been designated as Landfall Park. [SEP] Another monument, to the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, sits a little way from the cross. [SEP] This depiction of the Olympic rings on a circular plinth is here because the Olympic flame was brought to San Salvador on its way to Mexico.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
e leads to the village of Tihingan, one of only two places in Bali where the gongs for gamelan orchestras are made. [SEP] The other is Sawan, near the north coast (see page 65). [SEP] In any of the bronze foundries, you’ll find the same medieval scene, with a boy apprentice pumping the bellows to keep a charcoal fire blazing while the smiths hammer away. [SEP] Hanging mats keep the place in semi-darkness so that the workers can judge the temperature of the glowing metal by its color. [SEP] In the village of Banda, about 5 km (3 miles) south of Tihinga, a museum celebrates one of Bali’s most successful contemporary artists, Nyoman Gunarsa. [SEP] On the eastern periphery of Klungkung a bridge crosses the gorge of the Unda river, which is used as a big communal bath every afternoon as the sun	goes	down. [SEP] Ash, mud, and floods from the 1963 eruption of Gunung Agung devastated this part of the island, and the effects are still felt today, as its agriculture has not yet fully recovered from the disaster.

Mengwi Just to the northwest of Kapal, there’s a major road junction. [SEP] The right fork	goes	north to Bedugul (see page 61) and Singaraja, but you only have to go 3 km (2 miles) to reach the town of Mengwi, where you’ll find one of Bali’s most beautiful temples. [SEP] Pura Taman Ayun, near the center of town, was built in 1634 and renovated in 1937. [SEP] It’s notable for its double moat. [SEP] Every morning as well as late in the afternoon, people use the wide outer moat for washing themselves and their clothes. [SEP] You can circle the outside of the wall that surrounds the inner compound and look in at the cluster of merus (pagoda-like, multi-roofed towers). [SEP] Meru towers may only contain an odd number of roofs.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
[SEP] It is 10 km (6 miles) down a narrow side road from Kediri to the coast, and there can be a long procession of traffic. [SEP] You might like to plan a dawn visit instead, avoiding at least some of the hawkers who congregate later in the day. [SEP] Tanah Lot is believed to have been founded in the 16th century by the Javanese priest Nirarta, who dedicated it to the sea god. [SEP] Now the sea threatens to undermine the rock on which it stands, and concrete breakwaters have been positioned to hold back the waves. [SEP] Nothing, however, is done to hold back the commercial tide. [SEP] Ever more souvenir stands and food stalls cluster as near as they can get, and the nearby coast is being developed as a huge, and controversial, resort complex. [SEP] But the former raja’s capital of Tabanan	goes	about its business with few concessions to tourism. [SEP] The Dutch burned the palace here in 1906, so the heart of the old town is gone, but Tabanan remains a center for music and dance. [SEP] Kerambitan, just off the main road to the southwest, is a pretty town with three palaces, still the property of a princely family. [SEP] Today, one of the palaces, the Puri Anyar, acts as an aristocratic type of homestay, where guests can experience the traditional hospitality that might have been extended to honored visitors in the past. [SEP] The main road reaches the coast at Soka, with two small beaches and occasional good surfing waves. [SEP] Balian Beach is similar, with informal bungalow accommodations.

entertainment Spaniards have earned a reputation as consummate partiers, and while Barcelona may not be as fanatical about late nights as Madrid, it is still a place that really swings when the sun	goes	down. [SEP] It has virtually every kind of nightlife diversion, from cool cabarets to live jazz, rock, flamenco, and world beat to opera, and a thriving bar and disco scene. [SEP] At night, some streets, like the Rambla and Passeig de Gràcia, become slow-moving rivers of strollers. [SEP] The main churches and monuments are illuminated, and the city takes on a new and graceful aspect. [SEP] The weekly cultural guide Guía del Ocio contains up-to-date information on all entertainment in Barcelona (available at newsstands, in Spanish), while Barcelona Olé!, a monthly guide put out by Barcelona Tourism, has information on big shows and performances.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
aded with sculptures depicting angel choirs and musicians, and Biblical episodes such as the birth and youth of Jesus, the Flight into Egypt, the Slaughter of the Innocents, the Tree of Calvary, and much, much more. [SEP] The cathedral is intended to incorporate every aspect of creation and faith. [SEP] Twelve towers, four at each portal, are to represent the Apostles; four higher ones, the Evangelists; a dome over the apse, the Virgin; and the central spire, the Savior. [SEP] Both, an elevator and steps give access to a lookout from one of the east towers. [SEP] On the west side is a modern sculptural interpretation, much criticized, that has galvanized those who believed the temple should have been left as it was, unfinished, as a tribute to the great Gaudí. [SEP] Nevertheless, onward it	goes	— when it will be finished, nobody knows. [SEP] For now and perhaps the generation to come, the great spires are marred by ever-present scaffolding and cranes. [SEP] A short walk diagonally from La Sagrada Familia is the astonishing Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, designed by Domènech i Montaner (architect of the Palau de la Música Catalana) and completed by his son. [SEP] The complex of buildings — still a working hospital — is one of modernisme’s most underrated (and least known) achievements.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
1975 by the architect Josep Lluís Sert to house a large collection of paintings, drawings, tapestries, and sculpture by the Catalan surrealist. [SEP] Miró died in 1983 at the age of 90. [SEP] The exhibits follow Miró’s artistic development from 1914 onwards. [SEP] Photographs show him always neatly dressed and barbered, looking like a Catalan businessman in contrast to the more bohemian Picasso, and in contrast, too, with the surrealist works he created. [SEP] The collection is witty and bright with the bright colors and unique language symbols associated with the artist. [SEP] The Avinguda de Miramar continues past the station of the funicular railway that climbs the hill from the Avinguda del Paral.lel near the Paral.lel metro stop. [SEP] The funicular links up here with a cable car that	goes	to the Parc d’Atraccions de Montjuïc, an amusement park, and on to the Castell de Montjuïc on the summit. [SEP] Cable cars run daily in summer, weekends-only in winter. [SEP] A short walk from the amusement park is the Plaça de l’Armada station for the cable car that crosses the harbor, completing an interesting network of transport by cable. [SEP] The fortress atop Montjuïc, built in 1640, remained in use by the army and then as a prison until shortly before it was turned over to the city to become a museum in 1960. [SEP] The Museu Militar (Military Museum) has an extensive collection of antique weaponry and armor, lead soldiers of different epochs, and models of Catalan castles.

 The Scroll Market, in the Xicheng District inside the Second Ring Road North, sells handpainted scrolls, chops, and goldfish.

[SEP] The Hongqiao Market (also known as the Chongwenmen Market and the Farmers’ Market), on the northeast edge of the Temple of Heaven (Tiantan) Park, is the best place to shop for jewelry bargains, especially pearls. [SEP] The Panjiayuan Antique and Curio Market (variously known as the “Dirt Market,” “Ghost Market,” and “Sunday Market”) is the most interesting to browse in Beijing.

lmost every well-to-do family had a horse-drawn vehicle. [SEP] However, these disappeared almost immediately following a relaxation of the strict rules that had kept motor vehicles off the island. [SEP] This collection of beautiful carriages celebrates those “gone-but-not-forgotten” days. [SEP] St. Peter’s Church sits on Duke of York Street, now the main route through the town. [SEP] Originally built in 1612, it is the oldest Anglican church in the Western Hemisphere still regularly used for services; much of the present structure dates from 1713. [SEP] The beautiful building is filled with Bermudian cedar for the roof supports and the pews. [SEP] The font is even older than the church itself and was brought with the earliest settlers from a previous church in England. [SEP] Pride of place	goes	to the collection of silver, the chalice, the chalice set, and the alms basin, all dating from the 17th century. [SEP] The church has also kept old coins dating from 1616. [SEP] Behind the south churchyard you can find the Old Rectory, built in the 18th century for pirate George Drew and kept in beautiful order by the Bermuda National Trust. [SEP] Take Duke of Kent Street north from the town center to reach a number of important attractions. [SEP] Almost immediately on the left is St. George’s Historical Society Museum, set in an 18th-century house that was once home to the Mitchell family.

[SEP] Just past Magnolia Hammond Castle Museum looms above the entrance to Gloucester Harbor. [SEP] Inventor John Hays Hammond, Jr. built this medieval-style castle to house his early Roman, medieval, and Renaissance collections. [SEP] It also contains an 8,200-pipe organ (concerts are given). [SEP] Gloucester (38 miles/61 km from Boston) is a gritty salty town, the country’s oldest fishing port and also the busiest on the Massachusetts coast. [SEP] Rows of gulls perch on the ridges of the factory roofs that line the wooden quays and jetties, while a steady stream of fishing craft and whale-watch cruisers weigh and drop anchor. [SEP] It’s also home to one of the most engaging small museums anywhere, the Cape Ann Historical Assoc	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
Early Settlers The settlement of present-day Hungary	goes	far back in time. [SEP] Less than 64 km (40 miles) to the west of Budapest, human traces thought to be half a million years old have been excavated and are now on display at the Hungarian National Museum. [SEP] The ﬁrst tribes that came to this area brought skills and tools which improved the lot of the hunter, made farming feasible, and, in time, gave rise to primitive industries. [SEP] Around the third century b.c., Hungary was occupied by a Celtic-Illyrian tribe known as Eraviscans, refugees from wars in Greece. [SEP] They established a tribal centre on top of Gellért Hill and continued the early settlers’ artistic and industrial innovations.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
This is an old narrow-gauge line which traverses seemingly unspoiled forests — but for the numerous walking trails — and climbs, slowly, ever-upwards. [SEP] At the ﬁrst stop, Normafa, you’ll find a ski-run, but unless it’s snowing stay on the train until János-hegy. [SEP] It is a 10–15 minute walk from here to the János-hegy lookout tower, at 529 metres (1,735 feet) the highest point in the city. [SEP] If the horizon is not blurred by mist, there’s a splendid 360-degree view for mile upon mile; you can also eat here. [SEP] On the way to the lookout tower you will have passed a chair-lift that	goes	down to a camping site. [SEP] The views from the chair-lift are also spectacular, and the peace and quiet as you soar up and down the mountainside is quite extraordinary. [SEP] Remember to note that the chairlift is closed on some Mondays — check with Tourinform, or go on another day. [SEP] If you would prefer a speedy return to town, catch the 158 bus (to Moszkva tér) from near the bottom of the chair-lift.

You can see Yosemite Creek drop down half a mile from the opposite wall in the spectacular Upper, Middle, and Lower Yosemite Falls, and you’ll get an outstanding view of the majestic Half Dome, a granite monolith sliced in two by the Ice Age glaciers. [SEP] From here you may feel like leaving the bus and hiking back down to the valley, along the Panorama Trail via the Nevada and Vernal Falls, a trip of 8 miles (13 km), most of it downhill! [SEP] A beautiful and easy hike	goes	out to Mirror Meadow, tucked in underneath the vertical northwest face of Half Dome. [SEP] The trail is especially good during early spring or summer mornings, when the waters are perfectly still, capturing the most breathtaking colors from the trees and the cliffs of Mount Watkins behind it.

The Centre’s design, in a lovely green ravine of the Don River valley, makes an exciting first impression. [SEP] Architect Raymond Moriyama has linked up the Centre’s several buildings with escalators and passageways like a series of atomic nuclei, comparable to his work on the various spaces and levels of the Metro Toronto Library. [SEP] Inside, it’s one thing to remember what your teacher told you about static electricity, and quite another to touch (without risk) the Centre’s 500,000-volt sphere and see your hair stand on end. [SEP] You can man the controls of a space vehicle for a simulated moon-landing, broadcast your voice clear around the world through a parabolic sound reflector, or find out what	goes	on off-camera in a fully equipped TV studio. [SEP] The McMichael Canadian Collection (in the village of Kleinburg, 25 km/15 miles, 40 minutes’ drive, northwest of Toronto) consecrates the work of one of Canada’s best-known schools of painting, the Group of Seven. [SEP] These artists of the first half of the 20th century sought the sources of their inspiration in a distinctly Canadian landscape rather than in the derivative themes of European painting. [SEP] The museum has chosen an appropriate setting of evergreen forest overlooking the Humber valley for its location. [SEP] The stone and log building is itself, in more solid form, a visual reference to the log cabins of the country’s earliest settlers. [SEP] Look out, too, for the Inuit and Indian art, most notably the work of Norval Morris	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
Switching its echoes from Westminster to Buckingham Palace, Parliament Hill provides pomp with a Changing of the Guard by 125 soldiers of the Governor General’s Foot Guards (June 23 to August 25, 2001 at 9:45 a.m). [SEP] On summer evenings, a sound and light show illuminates the Parliament Buildings to present, alternately in English and French, a 30-minute history of Canada. [SEP] Sparks Street Mall, the first street in Ottawa to be paved and then the city’s, indeed the country’s, first traffic-free pedestrian zone, is a pleasant shopping area enlivened by street musicians and clowns and bordered by some first-class modern office buildings. [SEP] Pride of place	goes	to the elegant 12-story mirror-glass Bank of Canada (between Kent and Bank Streets) by Arthur Erickson. [SEP] The green patina of the building’s copper skeleton is an artful homage to the copper roofs on the old Parliament Buildings. [SEP] Inside is the Currency Museum (see page 78). [SEP] On the vast three-sided Confederation Square — popularly known for its traffic congestion as “Confusion Square” — notice the great granite arch of the National War Memorial, with its statues of 22 World War I soldiers and a horse-drawn cannon. [SEP] Ironically, it was dedicated by George VI just three months before the outbreak of World War II. [SEP] The square’s bunker-like National Arts Centre (1969) houses the capital’s ballet, opera, and theater, but it’s the summer beer-garden overlooking the Rideau 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
Entertainment Once the sun	goes	down, Cancún gears up. [SEP] There’s no shortage of places to go or things to do, and no need to take a long novel to fill those quiet moments — there just won’t be any. [SEP] Many people don’t take to their beds until they’ve seen the sun come up. [SEP] If you choose to stay in Mujeres or Cozumel, things will be a bit more laid back. [SEP] The diving fraternity tends to enjoy low-key, less glamorous entertainment and relatively early nights before they head under the waves early the following day. [SEP] Before you head straight into the resort atmosphere of Cancún, check out what’s happening in your hotel. [SEP] Many have “Las Vegas style” floor shows, Mexican evenings with traditional folk music and dances, and clubs where you can take to the dance floor yourself.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
 of land; you will see their gated entrances as you drive by. [SEP] Next to these are the more modest accommodations that for years have catered to dedicated divers. [SEP] Around 5 km (3 miles) from town you will find the entrance to Chankanaab State Park. [SEP] This was one of the first sites on the island to offer organized reef snorkeling in an offshore lagoon, though as it became more popular it developed other attractions. [SEP] Snorkeling is still extremely good offshore, though the lagoon site is now devoid of marine life and is used simply as a safe swimming area. [SEP] Chankanaab offers a botanical garden and a sculpture park displaying native art from all areas of Mexico. [SEP] It has a dive shop, beach umbrellas, sun beds, and two restaurants. [SEP] Perhaps the prize of the park	goes	to the “Swim with the Dolphins” program. [SEP] The dolphins are kept in open water just offshore and reached by a wooden walkway. [SEP] Small groups of people can enter the water with the dolphins; an instructor controls the activities and exercises. [SEP] South from Chankanaab you can stop at a number of fine sandy beaches on the west coast. [SEP] The major sites are Playa San Francisco, Playa del Sol, and Playa Palancar. [SEP] All the main beaches have public access and each has its own café-bar, watersports facilities, and lockers for beachgoers. [SEP] The water is a beautiful clear turquoise color; you will see small dive or snorkel boats bobbing offshore as you soak up the sun.

Chongqing (Chungking) Although the city’s history	goes	back thousands of years, Chongqing was never a cultural center, and it isn’t today. [SEP] It cannot offer spectacular temples, palaces, or archaeological sites. [SEP] Rather, it is a place to see the daily life of a major Chinese industrial city and to begin some outstanding excursions on the legendary Yangzi River. [SEP] In the Qin Dynasty, in the third century b.c., the city was the capital of the dreamily named Kingdom of Ba. [SEP] Its present name (Chongqing means “Double Jubilation”) dates from the medieval period, commemorating a lucky streak in the life of the local prince. [SEP] Until the last few years it was spelled Chungking, by which name the city was best known in the West as the political and military capital of the Nationalist government from 1939 to 1945, the wartime redoubt	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
ople’s Hall, built in 1953 to serve as a 4,000-seat conference hall and hotel. [SEP] It blends the styles of the Ming and Qing dynasties with the needs of a modern conference hall. [SEP] The Chongqing Museum, while poorly-lit and aging, does contain a collection of dinosaur eggs and two 3,000-year-old wooden boats that, suspended from the cliffs of the Yangzi, served as caskets for nobles in the days of the Ba Kingdom. [SEP] Perhaps the liveliest sight in Chongqing is the 1,000-year-old Luohan Temple, where blind fortune-tellers and devoted followers of Buddha converge from dawn to dusk. [SEP] In the domain of darker political history, two former Nationalist prisons outside town are open as monuments to the Revolutionary cause. [SEP] The US/Chiang Kai-shek Criminal Acts Exhibition Hall (so	goes	the catchy title) includes cells and torture chambers. [SEP] Western visitors are not usually shown around unless they specifically request it. [SEP] This is largely in deference to the sensitivities of Europeans and Americans, who are blamed for collusion with the Nationalists in the excesses of their anticommunist struggle. [SEP] Because of Chongqing’s notoriously torrid summer weather — it’s known as one of the “ovens” of China — hills and parks are a very welcome refuge here. [SEP] Loquat Hill (Pipashan), the city’s highest spot, has gardens, a teahouse (Hongxing), and some splendid panoramas. [SEP] The Northern and Southern Hot Springs parks (Beiwenquan and Nanwenquan) are also popular gathering places, with well-kept public gardens.

Tourists are so numerous in the otherwise relaxed shopping district of Guilin that the pedestrian crossings have signs in English as well as Chinese. [SEP] Another cosmopolitan influence comes from the area’s many minority peoples: Guilin is part of the Guangxi-Zhuang Autonomous Region, which borders Vietnam. [SEP] The proliferation of so-called Muslim restaurants is explained by the presence here of thousands of people of the traditionally Muslim Zhuang nationality, China’s largest minority group. [SEP] The geological history of Guilin, the key to the wonder of its moody mountains and caves,	goes	back several hundred million years. [SEP] The area was under the sea when an upheaval raised it to the status of terra firma. [SEP] Later it was flooded, then lifted again in further cataclysmic events. [SEP] The alternation of sea water and air through the millennia created limestone formations called karst, which eroded into pinnacles, mounds, and peaks that captivate the imagination. [SEP] Guilin was settled more than 2,000 years ago when the Ling canal was built, effectively linking the great Yangzi and Pearl rivers. [SEP] Guilin’s connection with one of mankind’s most ambitious engineering projects was important, but otherwise little was heard from the town. [SEP] It served as provincial capital for several hundred years, and in modern times, thanks to the profusion of caves to hide in	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
led “Longevity Bridge.” [SEP] Here and elsewhere, the rich, flat land produces the ingredients for a formidable fruit salad: oranges and grapefruit, chestnuts and persimmons, plus exotic tropical delicacies all but unknown outside Asia. [SEP] Adding to the entrancing beauty of the scene, great stands of a feathery variety of bamboo grow along the riverbanks, forming huge cascades of green. [SEP] Beyond the village of Yangdi unfolds the uncanny scenery that prompted a Chinese poet more than a thousand years ago to write: “The river is a green silk belt, the mountains emerald hairpins.” [SEP] Peaks and pinnacles crowd the river, white goats pose on steep mountainsides, and an eagle soars above the cliffs. [SEP] The river itself flows green and transparent. [SEP] Credit for this limpid rarity	goes	not only to the strict antipollution standards to protect the River Li but also to nature itself, which endows the water with a high content of carbonic acid. [SEP] Mural Hill is so called because the sheer cliff face comprises so many patches of color that it might be a fresco. [SEP] In the lights and shadows of the cliff, the shapes of nine different horses can be discerned, hence the cliff’s alternate name, “Nine Horse Hill.” [SEP] Near the end of the voyage, the village of Xinping comes into view on the left bank, surrounded by magical scenery — landmarks with names like Snail Hill, Five Fingers Hill, and Carp Hill.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
rns to thrust his sword deep into the bull’s aorta for the kill. [SEP] Success means instant death. [SEP] But the target, a tiny fist-sized area between the shoulders, can only be reached when the animal’s feet are together; and swift kills, which need strength as well as skill and nerve, don’t always happen. [SEP] If the fight has been good and the kill clean, the presidente will award the torero one or both of the bull’s ears and, for exceptional performances, the tail, too. [SEP] An ear is usually the signal for a lap of honour, and, if the crowd agrees with the award, flowers and botas of wine shower into the ring. [SEP] Very occasionally an exceptional performance by the bull earns him a reprieve for breeding. [SEP] In this case, the presidente drops a green handkerchief and the crowd	goes	wild. [SEP] The corrida is not for everyone — not even for every Spaniard.

Perhaps the most illustrious resident of the neighborhood was Moses Maimónides. [SEP] And a statue of the 12th-century doctor, philosopher, and theologian stands a few steps from the synagogue in the square named in his honor, Plaza de Maimónides. [SEP] Also in the plaza is the Casa de las Bulas, which holds the interesting combination of a small market of Córdoban craftspeople selling silver filigree and tooled leather goods, and the Museo Taurino (Bullfighting Museum). [SEP] Northeast of the mosque on the Plaza Jerónimo Paéz, the splendid Renaissance Palacio Paéz houses the Museo Arqueológico Provincial. [SEP] The exhibits span the centuries from the Iberian era to the Visigothic period, but pride of place	goes	to objects from the 10th-century palace of Medina Azahara, like the bronze figure of a stag taken from a fountain presented by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII. [SEP] A Christian king, Alfonso XI, built Córdoba’s Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos, overlooking the river to the southwest of the mosque. [SEP] The ramparts offer a fine view over the old town and the river, the islets in midstream each occupied by a ruined Moorish mill, and the ridges of the Sierra de Córdoba low on the northern horizon. [SEP] The Catholic Monarchs received Columbus and planned the invasion of Granada while residents here.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
Zorba the Greek? [SEP] Music and Dance For many, the image of Greek music and dance is inexorably linked to the film “Zorba the Greek.” [SEP] Anthony Quinn performs the syrtáki dance (in fact an amalgam of several different traditional dances), to the sound of the bouzoúki, a stringed guitar-type instrument that produces melodic, slightly metallic sounds. [SEP] When played live it has a haunting melody, but taverna owners do have the irritating habit of playing it at high decibels through overloaded speakers. [SEP] This does a great disservice to the Greek musical tradition, which is rich, varied and	goes	back for hundreds of years. [SEP] The tradition is still particularly strong on Crete where traditional musicians and singers are held in high regard. [SEP] Musical rhythms were traditionally matched to the complex cadences of the epic poetry of Greece. [SEP] These are very different from the ‘four beats to a bar’ that characterizes the western musical tradition, and therefore it is sometimes difficult for Western listeners to follow. [SEP] Songs have traditionally been sung by men — relating the hard life of the farmer or fisherman and including an element of sentimentality rarely expressed in other areas of a Greek male’s life.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
ure and multicolored façades make it one of the most photographed villages in the world. [SEP] Aside from the stunning views, Santorini has many more delights to show its visitors, with 12 villages to visit set among agricultural land. [SEP] The fertile volcanic soil is blanketed in vines — over 100,000 bottles of wine are produced here every year — or in plants producing tiny sweet tomatoes, a speciality here. [SEP] In the center of the island is the village of Pirgos with the remains of a Venetian fortress at its heart. [SEP] On a rocky bluff beyond the village you will find the 17th-century Monastery of Profítis Ilías. [SEP] The monastery is only open when the priests inside take liturgies — mornings or early evenings — but it is well worth taking the time to visit. [SEP] Pride of place	goes	to a 15-century icon of the prophet Elijah. [SEP] It also has a museum, which conveys a flavor of monastic life, along with icons and manuscripts. [SEP] Unfortunately the hilltop is also shared with the Greek military and it bristles with satellite and digital technology, prohibiting photography of the beautiful panorama. [SEP] On the east coast are beaches of fine black or red sand — another legacy of the volcanic activity — which heat to a ferocious temperature in the summer sun. [SEP] In the south of the island is one of the most important ancient sites in the Mediterranean. [SEP] Near the modern village of Akrotíri, a complete city was discovered dating from before 2000 b.c. It was totally covered by several feet of ash during the eruption around 1500 b.c., but unlike the tragic city of	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
Not far from the museum is one of Santiago’s best places to get sweaty in the evening. [SEP] The Casa de las Tradiciones, a “cultural center” in a sweet little pink house (Calle General Lacret, 651), has live music and as much dancing as its tiny space will allow. [SEP] It’s great fun, and the locals usually outnumber the tourists. [SEP] Just west of the Padre Pico steps (south of the train station) is the one-room César Escalante cigar factory, unimpressive by comparison with other Cuban cigar factories but still an enjoyable place to visit, and the Ron Caney rum factory. [SEP] The oldest rum distillery in the country, it was established in 1838 by Don Facundo Bacardí (whose descendants fled the country in 1959) and nationalized the following year. [SEP] The rum produced here now	goes	under the name “Havana Club.” [SEP] You can visit only a small museum and bar.

North of Moncada, beyond the bus station, is the Plaza de la Revolución, a frighteningly polluted open square at the corner of Av. [SEP] las Américas and Av. [SEP] de los Libertadores. [SEP] Massive spears thrust toward the sky in this monument to Antonio Maceo, a hero of the war of independence, who is seen riding triumphantly. [SEP] The fine Cementerio Santa Ifigenia, just north of the harbor (Av. Crombel and Reparto Juan Gómez), is the resting place of many Cuban heroes. [SEP] Pride of place	goes	to the Cuban founding father José Martí, in a vast octagonal mausoleum designed so that the tomb catches the sun throughout the day. [SEP] Look also for the tombs of Céspedes and Frank País; Frank’s (as santiagueros refer to him) is marked like many others with the Cuban flag and the flag of the 26 July movement. [SEP] In an impressive setting 7 km (4 miles) from the city is the 17th century El Morro Castle, surveying the harbor mouth from a commanding clifftop position. [SEP] Moated, thickly walled, and full of cannons, drawbridges, and passageways, it is in excellent condition. [SEP] One room houses displays on pirates through the ages.

[SEP] No need to worry about packing up the tent or cleaning the breakfast dishes: that’s what you’ve hired the porters to do. [SEP] Porters stop for their first real meal of the day — rice and lentils — between 10 and 11am, and consequently, trekkers can also expect to eat lunch fairly early, usually on the edge of a village or at a scenic vista. [SEP] After a bit of exploration in the area, there will be a few more hours of hiking before calling it quits for the day around 3pm, once again usually in an interesting village. [SEP] The porters will then busy themselves with setting up camp, usually in a designated campground, and preparing the evening meal. [SEP] The sun often	goes	behind the mountains early, and supper always follows soon after sunset, usually around 6pm. [SEP] With only kerosene lamps to keep away the dark, exhausted trekkers usually head for bed by 9pm. [SEP] For trekkers doing a lodge-to-lodge trek, the day’s schedule is slightly different. [SEP] There is usually no “bed tea,” but there might be a wide range of choices for breakfast (many lodges now have electric ovens, and fresh baked breads and rolls are all the rage).	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4

KathmanduValley Just minutes away from the heart of Kathmandu, life	goes	on as it has for centuries in the rural communities of the valley.

[SEP] In the valley, at least the main street of principal villages is paved and accessible by taxi and bus, though the slower pace of walking or cycling is the most pleasant way to enter this world where time seems to have stopped. [SEP] Farmland begins at the very edge of the cities, and the fields are full of activity whatever the season. [SEP] Rice needs lots of water, so the paddy (the shoots are grown from seed) is transplanted when the June rains flood the fields.

Travel by road provides a glimpse of the Terai, an extension of the Ganges Plain. [SEP] This well-watered farming zone stretches the length of the country on its southern border with India. [SEP] It’s only about 40 km (25 miles) wide, but a third of Nepal’s population lives here, producing much of the nation’s food. [SEP] A visit to Lumbini, birthplace of Gautama Buddha, can also be made in about three hours from Chitwan. [SEP] (There are also flights from Kathmandu to Bhairawa, the nearest airfield, with a bus service to Lumbini.) [SEP] The story	goes	that Buddha’s mother gave birth to him under a tree in a garden at Lumbini, unable to get back in time to the palace, some 20 km (12 miles) away.

[SEP] Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world come to Lumbini, and in recent years the site has been developed into an international cultural and religious park with several hotels and numerous Buddhist temples built by the world’s various Buddhist countries.

[SEP] The serious punter who wants to avoid the frills and Champagne can have a very good time at Vincennes and Enghien trotting races. [SEP] Rugby and football (soccer) can be seen at the spectacular new Stade de France on the northern outskirts at St-Denis or at Parc-des-Princes at the south end of the Bois de Boulogne. [SEP] Nearby, tennis tournaments are held at Roland-Garros, or indoors over at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, near the Gare de Lyon.

Estoril Coast The Costa do Estoril (formerly called the Costa do Sol) begins just west of Lisbon and	goes	all the way around the tip of the peninsula to Guincho on the open Atlantic. [SEP] Those seeking pollution-free swimming (see page 132) usually head for Guincho, but the famous old resort of Estoril itself, some 24 km (15 miles) from Lisbon, is still worth a visit. [SEP] The beaches and resorts west of Lisbon are all accessible by train from the capital’s Cais do Sodré station. [SEP] While Estoril is a full-scale resort — cosmopolitan and sybaritic — Cascais, which sits on a pretty curved bay, leads a double life, as a town of fishermen and kings, where the humble and the retiring rich coexist with camera-toting tourists.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
g above a handsome stone arched bridge and leafy park, the church of the former 16th-century monastery of São Gonçalo is well worth a visit, especially if you are looking for love: It hosts a pilgrimage in June for women seeking husbands (with the exchange of phallic-shaped cakes—a remarkably literal step in the mating dance). [SEP] The river bends and twists, widens and narrows among green terraced hills. [SEP] The port trade prompted the growth of Peso da Régua (usually called just Régua), 70 km (43 miles) east of Porto. [SEP] Régua was once the main port used to ship young wines downriver in barcos rabelos (flat-bottomed wooden boats) to Vila Nova de Gaia. [SEP] Though the railways took over for transport from Pinhão (at the confluence of the Douro and Pinhão rivers), and today the wine	goes	mostly by road, Régua remains an important transportation and commercial hub. [SEP] What the town lacks in beauty it makes up for in industry. [SEP] The headquarters of port winemakers, Casa do Douro, remains in Régua (visitors can pick up a map of the Port Wine Route there).

[SEP] Olhão used to be described as the “little white Cubist town of the Algarve,” its architecture likened to that of North African towns. [SEP] The parish church (which also	goes	by the name of Nossa Senhora do Rosário) was founded by King Dom Pedro II in 1698. [SEP] The small chapel at the rear, Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos (Our Lady of the Afflicted), is where women often pray when their fishermen husbands are away at sea. [SEP] Instead of the red-tiled roofs and filigreed chimneys seen elsewhere in the Algarve, the Olhão skyline comprises flat-topped roofs of terraces called açoeitas. [SEP] The Olhão fish market is one of the Algarve’s best, especially famous for its mussels and other shellfish.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
Northern Beaches and Towns Further north beyond Nuevo Vallarta are a succession of small towns and relatively undeveloped beaches, in easy reach by car. [SEP] Just a few kilometers to the east, traditional Mexican farming life	goes	its unhurried way up steep mountain roads where views can be superb and well worth the extra drive. [SEP] The simple and the sensational seem to coexist so easily here. [SEP] Bucerías is a breezy beach community known for its fresh oysters and the palapa restaurants on its wide, white-sand beach. [SEP] Independent small hotels and rental homes provide overnight accommodations.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	4
