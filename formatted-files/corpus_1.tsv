Specifically, I mean, if you want to work at, work at one of these places, they, they, uh, generally have a lot of free help, so, uh, you're not going to make a whole lot of money doing this and they expect you to put in a full time schedule so you really can't work another job. But at any rate, I had this, this freedom and, um, the girl had	come	into my life to, to go and pursue this dream, so, um, I started working at place called D&D Studios, which was known for doing, um, a lot of hip hop music, kind of stuff similar to what I was interested in and I was hoping I'd be able to make some, some connections at least, maybe do a little bit of networking there, and, uh, I met some pretty cool people, did some really kind of really interesting projects, um, but-- What kinds of people?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	5	gone	come	driven	walked	arrived

So we take it back to my house and, uh, we are sitting there trying to bend it back and, uh, so his parents don't get mad at him that he messed up his jet ski or whatever.

Well when I got there, uh, I just rolled in there we dropped the jet skis off, and I just jetted right out all of the sudden, you know his parents didn't even know we had got there, and, uh, my friend Eric and he asked me again, "Are you OK to drive?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
And I also tend to, um, hear about authors from, you know, friends or, or hear of a famous book from a friend and I'll read one and if there happens to be a series on it then, you know, I'll start reading those. I actually just started reading, uh, the first three books of the Harry Potter series and I think those are intended for a much younger audience, but I've actually read all, the first three that have	come	out and I've enjoyed them `cause that's basically, it's about a kid who's a magician, basically, finds out that he's a magician.

And Dad said he had noticed, he had seen me throwing tomatoes in Mrs. Faulk's yard, so he told me that I was in trouble and I was going to get a spanking, and, um, I was kind of uh, uh looking for an out so I was smart enough to say, "Hey Dad!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

Is it like that all the time? Yep whenever he there, um, which he's not there he's there most of the time but he is gone a lot but whenever he is there, and especially if he gives you something to do it's like you don't even want it because you know it's going to be that way and it's like other people hesitate to	come	through because they don't want to have said something wrong and then you go back to him well like, you know, such and such helped me and it's not like you're ratting anybody out you're just saying you know such and such helped me and that's how I got to this number but it's like people are hesitating basically and it's really frustrating.

Um, and you look at other kinds of things and I think Charlotte, and maybe it's typical of the South, but I think that, uh, maybe there hasn't been as much growth here before and when you have growth and you have people coming in, who, looking for services. And you, and you also have a, a government, um, who are, are really ready to take that challenge as opposed to just deciding that, "Hey, listen we're gonna do things the way we've done it for the last, you know, 100 years, whether new people	come	or need services or ask for amenities or not, we're going to keep things the way they are." In fact, the town of Matthews, I think, um, at least my understanding is, is that when Providence Plantation, uh, reached a certain point in population they, they wanted to be annexed to the town of Matthews because they thought maybe that the city of Charlotte would annex them and so they wanted to, that they petitioned the town of Matthews to annex.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

The snowdrifts would	come	out into the streets into the road and, uh, this was in rural MN, so half the time you couldn't see where the road was anyway but they would go plowing these snowdrifts, you know.

It's important to make our mark in the sand and one way to do it certainly is to live a decent life and uh, if we can do that and add education competencies and skills that we can help lift someone else then uh, we would	come	to the end of the road with joy and happiness I think uh, saying that we have helped to make the world better.

Actually, I think it is most girls in general. It's just a natural thing if you, if you have certain guy friends that you become very possessive over and you see someone, whether it's their new girlfriend or their new best friend or whatever,	comes	in and takes up some of your time, I think it's just human nature to get jealous and to kind of put up a, you know, an offensive front to whoever the invader or the intruder is. So, I think I've probably done the some time in my life, so I don't have any hard feelings towards them.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives

And a car	comes	by and sees see a pocketbook they think, you know, we're going to pick this up and do one of two things. Their going to either take it, which what's more likely is that they're going to look because everybody knows everybody so they pick it up, or they get out of their car and they go to pick it up.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives

um-hum course the employment	comes	out before you ever see it but then the other stuff the private stuff we take out and then we disburse it into those uh accounts before we even start the rest uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives
uh we pay for check or else we take out of ATM services you know a certain amount of money and i write every check down for the amount of money or whoever takes money out of the ATM i write down that amount of money and as it	comes	through uh on on the statement then i'll block block it off in in a bright color so we know it's gone and i can see what's left out and what's left over to come through the statement to make sure that we don't overdraw ourselves or anything	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives

it's inexcusable if you want to come and want my money come and convince me don't call me on the phone yeah that's true i i guess that's uh where the old answering machine	comes	into play just screen a hundred percent of your calls and you don't have that that problem yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives

uh-huh the food	comes	out very tasty not very mushy you know and and it doesn't taste like a million calories of oil so um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2827-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives
yeah even though i've made more improvements on my house than somebody else has and nobody	comes	out to take a look and see what you've done to get a proper appraisal now out here they do they take pictures of house and everything and what they do is they look at what your particular model at least three of them have sold for within the last twelve months	#telephone#	telephone_sw2831-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives
and uh i'm trying it's about a it it it's one that was done a long time ago i think Tony Curtis uh uh uh was uh the star in where the guy dies falls overboard or something and	comes	back as a woman huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2841-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives
and uh there's uh uh a movie coming out uh gosh what's the name of that it's already out matter of fact it's been advertised on TV um about a guy that falls over he he gets killed somehow or another and he	comes	back as a woman and you talk about funny at least the little snapshot previews that they've shown on TV advertising it are hilarious i mean it is really funny	#telephone#	telephone_sw2841-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives

i think that's true especially as fast as they can print these things these days some of my stuff	comes	every two weeks and then it's a lot of material yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2845-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives
yeah right i think and it's a sad thing to say but i think it really depends on how much money it you know money it always	comes	back to money everything does but if uh Jerry Jones continues to pay these guys what you know they say they're paying them i don't know you know i think it depends on you end up you know the best players will come there if they're going to be paid the most so	#telephone#	telephone_sw2863-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives
and let me see what else have i seen what have you seen one	comes	to mind here and i can't i'm not sure about the name has Meryl Streep and um what was the name of that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2871-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives
yeah she's still she's still there but it looks like uh she may have some the opposition or they're they're trying to beat them she's been in for so long so we may hear some interesting things about her before election time	comes	up um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2872-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives
well i don't know it seems like there there are a lot of a lot more men at least in the the college level so well and that	comes	once again you know is that you can teach in elementary school you can even substitute in elementary school in the state of Texas without a uh without a certificate	#telephone#	telephone_sw2872-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives
uh-huh you know and i just throw as i'm using the white paper you know i just throw it right in there and then you know they have someone that	comes	around and pick it up you know every afternoon yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2876-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives
uh-huh they do try to say you you know you should have it certain way but um on the the slick newspaper print that	comes	in with like the Sunday papers and so on they haven't really protested magazines shouldn't be as a rule should not be put in but there are always a few of those pages and they must have a better way to do it now because they they haven't gotten too upset about that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2878-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives

right and that's difficult because i think in the long run uh part of the problem in society and maybe part of what happens to the bad the negative attitude of women working	comes	about because children remember the the traumas of their mothers trying to work and run the household and some of those things that that has not changed and i think that's a serious issue	#telephone#	telephone_sw2885-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives
or i don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news if it	comes	on i just happen to hear it now i will intentionally buy a newspaper to watch to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2888-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives

well as a matter of fact uh it's it's funny that i chose this subject because uh uh the city of Raleigh about six weeks ago has just uh put in a city wide recycling uh regime in which uh bottles and newspapers are recycled and a truck	comes	around uh once every couple of weeks and they separate your bottles for you and your newspapers and uh and they give you little uh or actually fairly large green plastic uh containers to put out curbside and all that so i think this is a real sign of progress here in the city of Raleigh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2928-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives
and uh i'm sure it's costing the city of Raleigh money but of course i mean that	comes	out of the taxes and so the people are ultimately paying for it and i think that people ought to ultimately pay for the convenience of having newspapers and bottles and and plastics and all that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2928-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives

We kind of had some, uh, not reservation about moving, it was an elective move for us, but certainly, um, living in a different part of the country than we were used to was, uh, something which was a change for us and something that we had thought long about.

Some, some folks, uh, either, uh, from the South don't value the people from the North and vice versa, but I think it's been a real positive thing, our move for us, in many ways.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

And you, and you also have a, a government, um, who are, are really ready to take that challenge as opposed to just deciding that, "Hey, listen we're gonna do things the way we've done it for the last, you know, 100 years, whether new people come or need services or ask for amenities or not, we're going to keep things the way they are."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Went in, and, uh, it always, mother had always talked about the staircase and how beautiful it was, and indeed it probably had been.

Even though I had freedom when I was, you know, home, whatever, but I still had a curfew. But here in college you don't have, I mean you can do what you want to, come and	go	as you please.

However, it didn't seem to be so horrifying. It was a story and I, you know, you knew it was fiction, but I would	go	back and read, when I could read myself, I read everything.

I just really didn't ever love poetry for some reason.

So you couldn't tell what kind, at night, what kind of people were	go	ing by, but you could hear clatter, because even beasts full of weapons, with, everything, you know? So that time, that I told you about when the, the soldiers came, my son escaped, dying, from fear, when I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
So, I came in, from where I was washing, I went in, and I didn't see what the guerrillas did with themselves, because I didn't see, they were in front, but since I went it, I didn't see. Then, you know, that in order to keep yourself out of trouble, you	go	in and don't, then they come, or, that was another time, that I suffered a terrible threat when the soldiers come through. And he said, "Ma'am," he said, "what did the guerrillas that were there eating do with themselves?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
So he says, "No, from the school up, are all guerrillas." I said, "The fact, you, I, you can be there," I said, "or I can stay here and you	go	in," I said, "you don't see where I get off to." Then they left, they left for the mountain, they went on up.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
He says, "And it's	go	ing to be very dangerous and it's very late." So, I said to him, "Oh, well, I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

That's how it was, it was said, but thank God in the family hardly-- The guerrillas also took out a man from the outskirts near the, the place where we lived, who was called Juan. He was like a catequist, one of those people who helps the priests, and according to the guerrillas, they say that he was starting to get them in trouble with the army, I mean, he started to say where they were, so that the soldiers would	go	directly to where they were, and one day they (guerrillas) took him out and killed him. And they put out the, the word that yes, they had killed him.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
Because it was more diverse. Like in most schools in Charlotte, if you	go	on other sides, it's like everybody's just white, but in my school, there was every kind of person you could ever meet.

To have something to fall back on and everything like that.

I think that's why they expect so much more of me. It kind of gets tiring and that's what I don't like, you know, I don't like to talk about myself when I	go	around my family.

So when I graduate, more than likely I'll move to Boston, but Charlotte has definitely been a nice place to live. I've never experienced any problems with crime or anything like that, and there's always been something for me to do, like in high school or in college, there's always things to	go	do, so it's been a nice place to grow up.

Physiological support differs from life support in that he handles the altitude chambers which run pilots up to 80 thousand feet in high altitude chambers, and brings him back down.

Then he'd dress me, and, uh, he'd set the injection on me and you, uh, uh, we'd have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then we'd come up breathing as hard as we could, and you better if uh, the, the, the top portion of your helmet surged, which you had rubber around the neck and the visor closed.

OK, well, that's where I went.

They asked a few questions and I answered them and they said, "Get your baggage and leave there immediately, and come to the address you were supposed to when you arrived in Washington."

Different, totally different types parachutes and in an bird that flies, uh, three times the speed of sound, over 22,000 miles an hour.

It made a huge impression on me and was a big thing. Columbus, GA is the home of Fort Benning, GA, where the largest infantry school in the world at that time was there, and as a kid walking to school, and believe it or not, I did walk four or five miles to school and I would	go	up Brown Avenue, which was at that time the only road that would allow the convoys to come through. And I would walk along the road to school and convoys of young men would, uh, ride by in the backs of trucks and I would wave at them and it was not a sexual thing in those days.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
And they said, "Well, we don't care we don't mind that. We'll just bring us some cots from the Army and we'll	go	to the, uh, service station," which was several blocks away.

And we just became very, very close friends and loved them dearly. And, uh, he did	go	off to war and did come back and many years after that nearly every year they would come down to see us in Columbus from Erie.

There was someone in the car with him and I don't remember anything about that. But I do remember that we stood and watched him	go	by and waved at him.

And he said a few words, and he didn't want to move me because he, he saw the way I fell and thought maybe I'd broke some ribs or something and he didn't want to move me. So I am laying here in the middle of the road, and he kept asking if I am all right and I was like, "Yeah I'm all right," because I knew something was wrong with me, and I hate hospitals and, and I don't want to	go	to a hospital if something happens to me. But uh, I was like, "I'm all right."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
and I was like, "Yeah I'm OK Mom. I don't need to	go	to the hospital or anything like that, I am fine." And she	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
So I opened my mouth, and I couldn't get it, I couldn't shut it back. You had to	go	to the hospital like that ?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

Well, that night I couldn't sleep at all because it felt like a brick wall, a brick, I mean a brick wall was on my head, so much pressure was on my chin and stuff, my jaw.

Uh-huh. So uh, I had to	go	through that in high school. And you know, people started doing the "Kevin Talk."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
That's right. How did you	go	about doing that? Oh we had assignments where, um, we had to, um, write out the definition, actually write out, you know, using the word in a sentence.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
Well, not really, not as unusual as you might think. But, um, when we moved to VA, and I started to	go	to school here, um, the rejection I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
Umm, high school was when I would write it down and keep it!

And, I really appreciated the original stories from this perspective. He captured personalities in a way that, um, I still	go	back to th, those, uh, Pooh and Eeyore.

At, at that point in time I wasn't even thinking in the personality realm, and I hadn't drawn any connection to it. Um, it was, it was, just, um, more of my, you know, how the teenagers	go	through, uh, "Trying to find myself", a questioning period?

Um-hum. They	go	too many different places without bringing some level of resolution to whatever the, uh, issue is that they're dealing with, you know.

There's something, well not only that aspect of the way that the writer, he writes, he basically gives two different endings to the story. You know, you could stop at the answer that satisfies and think that that's the end of the story, but then you	go	to the next chapter and it's like, "Ah ha!"

And the depiction, the, the, the story that she depicts, um, is so, to me, has so many aspects of a true, the struggles of our lives, that every time I read it, because I'm a little different, I get something a little different from it. And that's one that I give it away, and then have to	go	get another copy! Because I always want that in my library.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

Um, and, um, I remember another time, um, being told about a time when the family was up in the mountains. We had this place that we would	go	to and they called it our rock.

But in front of the rock on, you know, the other three sides of this big rock the river was very swift.

And the parents are just, they would never show them, they would always have the perfect swing but they would always point to a bad one and they would just cut them down and just have it, and everybody would just keep breaking their arms and stuff and, um, I don't know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_McCloskeyKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

So, uh, but anyway, Deirdre was really, she, she, she was a, she really believed that that's what she wanted and that was what she should do. And, uh, as I	go	along, I'll, I'll talk a little bit more about, you know, my, my family's interpretation of this whole thing because that's part of what when I, when I think of Deirdre and I think of the loss of Deirdre, some of what I try to come to terms with is why, why my family interpreted her choice the way they did. But, um, because the, the general consensus was that she was too scared or somehow felt insecure and she couldn't be a part of the world they never, they never said, "Oh, she, she did this because this is what she believes."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
You know, it was simply that, "Oh, she doesn't know what she's doing, and she's misguided, and she's scared," that was the general consensus. Anyway, she became a nun, and, um, I would	go	and visit her. And, um, she was, she became, she was a teaching nun, she taught in a school, um, Marymount was the name of the, uh, of the convent and, and the school, and they had a, a school in Tarrytown but they also had a school in Manhattan.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
She ultimately ended up teaching art, because she was a very, very gifted artist, um, at Marymount. And when I would	go	over, first she was at Tarrytown, initially, and I would	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
And then, she, she was, she, she was, because she was convalescing, they, she stayed in New York, they, they didn't send her overseas again.

And, um, she, she was also taking classes at the Art Students' League, and I was taking classes at the Art Students' League, so we would pass in the halls, and she would show me what she was doing, and, um, and as I say, she was a very gifted artist, and she loved teaching and again, she still seemed very, you know I never	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
that maybe she had made wrong choices, but, um, she never expressed that. At some point this was, right about the time of Vatican II, because she started to wear different clothes, and it was, it was very, um, it was very discreet, I mean, she didn't suddenly just	go	out to Bloomingdale's and buy a whole lot of, you know, fashionable clothes, but, when I would	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

And, uh, my aunt at that time had, was diagnosed as having lung cancer and she was very sick. So Deirdre took, was, took a leave from the convent, she was given, um, permission, to, um, for temporary leave, and I don't know logistically how that works, but she was, she was allowed to	go	home and, and be with her mother, to help her, um,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
And, um, at that point Deirdre made the decision, and her mother did die, and it was, it was all very traumatic, my father was very sick, he's a manic depressive, so we were	go	ing through all of that, and he was very upset with the medical profession for how they were treating my aunt, and this and that.

you know, did you, did you feel more alive, making that choice, and actually dying, under those conditions?"

No big deal.

I was really afraid. But he told me to	go	ahead and try it, so I took the entrance test, and they accepted me into at the school, and I took some courses there.

Well I didn't like writing at the time but I took it upon myself to	go	ahead and write a paper.

I just	go	t to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never went back. But I love what I do and, uh, anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

Um, when they were still remodeling the house, it was Christmastime, and we still lived in the city, the phone rang uh, whether it did or it didn't, my father said it did. And we went, uh, he said that we had to	go	out to the farm because, uh, someone had left the light on in the barn. So we piled into the car, Christmas Eve, and it was snowing, so beautiful.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
My father was in the hospital at the time, and he died a month later. So my mother then left our home, and, uh, didn't have a home to	go	to, and built a home in the city, then, uh, was happy there, although she was lonely, I'm sure. And, uh, created another garden, but was never the same thing.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
We walked down to the creek and the watercress was still growing in the creek as it had as I grew up. Uh, it was interesting that the man was sensitive as we are, and he said that they would	go	to certain corners of the fields on the property that was sixty-seven acres and, you could still feel Mr. McGovern's presence. And, uh, I liked that	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
Um. But we would	go	home and my mother would always reassure us that uh, it's OK to be different. It's what is in your heart that matters.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
Uh, went around with, not so much a chip on my shoulder, just, uh, an inferiority complex and didn't realize until I	go	t older that I was very much proud to be Japanese. And uh,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

We would think "Oh yeah, right, you were rich." And then when I did	go	over to Japan, I did see what she was talking about and really felt guilty that we didn't believe her, totally believe her, that, that she had all this, but um, according to Japanese standards, uh, they are just very wealthy. And then they come here and they look at my house	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

kind of a long distance relationship! And my, um, fraternity was having a cocktail and I, of course, needed someone to	go	with since I didn't have a, uh, girlfriend at the time.

Not really, hmm, he grew up on a farm and, you know, playing sports was, um, and he was so much older that I was, he wasn't really in the best of health when I was growing up. Um, of course, we would	go	up there every Sunday for Sunday lunch and, uh, he would get out in the yard with us and watch us climb trees and throw rocks and play, but he never really participated because he was 70 years older, you know, 70 years older than I was. So your grandpa was fairly old when you were born?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

Um, so, uh, but what, but actually, my move was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me, oddly enough, um, because when I moved, um, I met like, you know, close friends that, actually, now I	go	to college with and who I was a roommate with for a year or so. Um, so even though it was kind of a scary experience being uprooted from everything you knew, um, it gave me the chance to see that change is	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
Absolutely! I wouldn't trade that experience for the world because there are too many people that I know who are very sheltered from not only new experiences, from like new ideas and new situations, and so I think it's kind of a blessing that I had the chance to	go	through this in the kind of, um, be the new kid and see what it was like to be the outsider and to not be in the in crowd, you know. Because, I mean, I think a lot of people who have never been on the outside don't understand what it's like to be kind of the kid that's, you know, not "Mr. Popularity," you know?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

before we went to bed. But if it was, like too late already well, we didn't listen to them, we couldn't, she didn't tell them to us, because we had to	go	to bed, but whenever she had time she would tell us.

well what do you think though um um i don't know i the the one problem i guess i have and maybe why so many women younger women now are choosing to	go	outside is i feel that in general in this society that being at home is not looked upon as um a job in itself whereas you know you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself but i know when i was working	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive

that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home and yet by the same token i think some of it is jealousy you you once in a while you hear them say things like i wish i had the choice you know i wish i was the one i would stay home with my kids if my wife would	go	out and support us uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
