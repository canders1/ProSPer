Hundreds of teeth left the building in the little boxes and plastic bags she kept on hand for conveying precious cargo to the Tooth Fairy.  She was a ubiquitous character in the neighborhood. At 6 feet 2, she was hard to miss. She was the go-to woman for cooking mounds of pasta for spaghetti dinners, selling T-shirts, helping to plan the annual Capitol Hill Classic walk and run. On Capitol Hill, it is said with some exaggeration that everybody knows everybody -- but it is also said that if you	walk	with Mary Rush, you needed a healthy ego because she really did know everybody.
