The combination of different sizes, colors, styles, fabrics, price lines, and consumer groups means that a retailer must carry an enormous range of different products. The more diverse the consumer base of the retailer, the larger the number of individual products typically measured in stockkeeping units (SKUs).2 This variety is portrayed in Table 3.1, which shows the number of SKUs provided annually by different types of retailers over the course of a year. The number of SKUs can range from just 10,000 for a discount food store like Costco, which offers a limited number of products sold in large quantities, to more than two million different items in an upscale department store.<n>Today retailers must manage this profusion of products. At an operational level, this means deciding what types and how many of any one good it should stock to maximize sales per square foot of available space—one of the most critical measures of retail performance. If all goes well, retailers allocate space to different goods efficiently, responding to shifts in consumer tastes (stocking the hits and discontinuing flops); setting pricing policies (markups and markdowns) to deal with both the direct cost of goods and the nature of consumer demand; and controlling inventory to reduce exposure to risk. Further, the contemporary retailer has to keep track of sales and inventory accurately by SKU.<n>The Elements of Traditional Retailing<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch3.txt
Part of HCTAR’s research effort has resulted in new automatic marker-making software based on computational geometry techniques. The software allows a manufacturer to take existing production markers and automatically “compact” the arrangement of pieces by translation or a combination of translation and allowable amounts of rotation.5 It automatically adjusts for changes in fabric width by moving the pieces to the left and up or down to fill the available width most efficiently. The more pieces in a marker, the more effort required to make an efficient marker of a given width. Therefore, if the cloth of a given bolt of fabric is half an inch wider than the marker, there is a tendency to cut the marker as is. Yet some users of this software have been able to decrease the amount of cloth lost in this way by as much as 2 percent.<n>The pants marker shown in Figure 8.1 was produced by this automatic layout software and yielded cloth utilization of 89.66 percent. The equivalent production marker made by the manufacturer’s highly skilled operator, using a computer but without HCTAR’s software, achieved a utilization of 89.54 percent, or just a little less than the fully automatic software system. Sometimes a human operator can beat the automatic system by a small amount, but the following example is typical. The production marker for the intimate apparel item in Figure 8.2 was initially laid out by a trained operator with 79.96 percent utilization; the HCTAR software compacted the marker and achieved cloth utilization of 81.54 percent, an improvement of 1.47 percent. One-third of the wholesale price of apparel is typically fabric cost. A 1 percent savings in fabric over the entire production goes directly to the bottom line. Such savings can add up to many millions of dollars for large manufacturers.<n>Based on our survey results, about two-thirds of the business units in 1992 generated markers by trained operators with computer assistance; when the survey response is weighted by dollars of yearly sales, however, 99.5 percent of the business units’ production came from computer-generated markers. In contrast, apparel operations in developing nations generally do not use computerized layout systems. Markers are made by hand, tracing pattern pieces onto sheets of paper from thick, pre-cut cardboard pattern elements. The primary alignment tool is the meter stick for measuring distances from the edge. It is not hard to imagine a tendency to allow a slight twist in individual pieces to achieve a closer fit between neighboring pieces.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
Yet just because many U.S. manufacturers rely on foreign contractors for a good portion of garment assembly, it does not mean sewing in a factory requires little or no skill. Only a very few sewing operations involve a machine that is fully automated, in which the operator’s job comes down to stacking parts at one end of the sewing system and re-threading the machines if a thread breaks. Today’s factory sewing machine is generally dedicated to a single operation and most likely will be fitted with specialized fixtures in the area of the stitch plate—to help guide the seaming a fixed distance from the fabric edge, for example, or fold the edge of the cloth under, or with other attachments that feed elastic tape and so on into the seaming operation as needed. More complicated sewing operations require the operator to guide differential stitching, with more fabric in each top stitch than in the bottom one. Regardless of which individual sewing operations are required, the operator must be trained and given practice time to achieve a quality product, at least at the standard production rates.<n>The time required for a new worker to achieve production standards, while maintaining quality, can range from days for the simplest operation to nearly a year for joining the sleeve to the body of a suit coat. A few sewing operations are so demanding that some operators are never able to achieve the minimum acceptable production rate for them. With different skill levels required for different operations, it is not surprising that piece rates vary with the difficulty of the operation. In this chapter, we will describe what actually goes on in today’s sewing room—the machines used, what operators do, the flow of operations—and how sourcing decisions for replenishable products may affect assembly operations in the future.4<n>Sewing Machines and Garment Assembly<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
The Lockstitch Machine<n>Almost all home machines are lockstitch machines. The top thread comes from a spool or cone of thread above the machine and goes through many thread guides, a thread tensioner, a take-up arm, and, finally, the needle. The bottom thread is wound on a bobbin, a small spool, that is below the needle and the sewing surface. To make a stitch, the needle with the top thread is plunged through the plies of fabric, and a loop of the top thread is formed below the surface of the stitch plate (often called a “throat plate”).5 The loop of top thread is passed over the bobbin and around its thread. The take-up arm then pulls up the top thread to set a stitch. The top and bottom threads are locked together by passing the loop of the top thread around the bobbin.<n>One part of the art of sewing comes in adjusting the thread tension.6 With a lockstitch machine, when the needle withdraws from the cloth and the take-up arm pulls the top thread tight, the stitch begins to be “locked” or set in place. If the tension on the top and bottom thread is too high, the seam puckers and the seam length becomes less than that of the cloth. If the tension is too low, the seam will be so loose one can see through it when holding up the joined pattern pieces. Indeed, a well-formed lockstitch is smooth and appears the same when viewed from either the top or bottom ply. Note that even if a sewing machine is properly adjusted for sewing a particular weight and color of fabric, it will generally need to be adjusted again if the fabric color changes because the mechanical properties of a given type of fabric can depend on the dye color used. The lighter the fabric weight, the more sensitive seam quality is to machine adjustments and thread tensions as well as to the ability of sewing operators to make necessary adjustments.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
The flow of operations through a typical men’s dress-shirt sewing factory is shown in Figure 9.1 (page 160). The subassemblies for the collars, backs, fronts, cuffs, and sleeves might be on one side of a center aisle down the factory floor and the major assembly steps on the other side. The factory manager needs to keep track of the flow of items through the plant to assure that the subassemblies, such as the sleeves, are ready to join the shirt. A given shirt must have a specified collar size and a given sleeve length. Clearly, the fabric, color, and style must also match. If the cut bundles are sent to the factory once a week, this manager might then put that week’s bundles into carts identified by a flag flying the color for that week. Note that the work in a shirt plant is generally grouped into production lots of 1,500 shirts if the progressive bundle system is used. Shirts are normally counted by the dozen, so a production lot comes to 125 dozen.<n>Each day, the manager looks over the factory floor to see if any carts with a particular flag color are falling behind the others of that group. Delays in product flow can result from machine problems, worker absence, or if priority is given to special orders. In some plants, the carts may contain up to a day’s worth of work. Although this may appear to be a crude way of keeping track of the work flow, it is simple and generally effective. Still, work almost never progresses in perfect lockstep through a factory. Finding the correct parts for a shirt can often involve a hunt through the plant. For example, a worker might accidentally leave a bundle of unfinished work in the cart when it goes back to be loaded again. Because a worker may have a day’s work in the carts in front of her, it is easy to see how individual bundles of parts can be misplaced—which, in turn, will hold up the assembly of some SKUs. Partially finished shirts and shirt subassemblies will then be in a number of places in the factory.<n>This shirt factory employs 250 workers. If the shirt in question is rated to require twelve minutes to assemble, such as the one in the figure, a forty-hour work week will produce 4,167 dozen shirts when the factory is operating at standard efficiency. (Of course, many plants may fall below the standard and take longer than twelve minutes to make that shirt.)10 A typical time for a shirt to go through the plant is four weeks, which means the plant will have 16,667 dozen shirts as work-in-process (WIP). The forty operations indicated in the figure may require only twelve minutes if the operators are working at 100 percent efficiency, but any given shirt still takes twenty working days to pass through the plant. To shorten the time significantly, the work-in-process in front of each of the twenty operations listed as part of the critical path would have to be reduced from a day to just several hours. Not all the forty different operations are sequential; the parts assembly goes on in parallel, but the final assembly involves a series of eleven operations that require all the subassemblies to be completed and ready to be mated with the correct parts.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt

Not all the forty different operations are sequential; the parts assembly goes on in parallel, but the final assembly involves a series of eleven operations that require all the subassemblies to be completed and ready to be mated with the correct parts.<n>Needless to say, reduction of throughput time is not a simple task. Some of the forty operations require very little time; others are much longer. Hemming the top of a shirt pocket is a short operation, for example, but it takes longer to attach the pocket and longer still if stripes must be matched. If there is one operator for the short operation, then there will have to be several operators for the longer one just to keep the production line in balance. If any one of the several operators speeds up or slows down, the line becomes unbalanced. If the imbalance lasts for more than an hour or so, the factory manager would have to take corrective action. A utility operator skilled in several operations might be brought over from another area to move work past the slow sewing station. Clearly, it is easier for the manager to keep all operators supplied with work, especially since in most cases the work-in-process for each operator is large. The large buffers are designed so that natural daily variations in work rhythm do not cause a major disruption. In fact, a production line is probably never in perfect balance. If it were, when even one worker in the plant changed her pace, the line would drift out of balance.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
Within this dynamic system in which inner and outer forces jointly engender development, each contributing factor inﬂuences—and is inﬂuenced by—the others. Therefore, the roles of heredity and environment, of the child and important people in his or her life, so closely interconnect that according to some experts, their inﬂuence is inseparable.56 To illustrate, let’s take two vibrant, contemporary research topics relevant to young children’s learning: (1) the dramatic growth of the brain during the ﬁrst 6 years, and (2) young children’s temperaments, or genetically inﬂuenced styles of relating to their physical and social worlds.<n>brain development. Many people think of infancy and early childhood as a time when the human brain is especially sensitive to experience. In line with this view, although genes provide the code for basic brain structures and functions, heredity goes only so far in aecting the organization of the child’s brain and the rate at which it develops. The environment has a crucial, profound impact.<n>How does early experience join with biology to aect brain development? The cerebral cortex, seat of human intelligence, undergoes dramatic growth during the ﬁrst few years. Almost all its neurons—cells that store and transmit information—are in place by the second trimester of pregnancy. Once established, neurons begin to take on unique functions by sending out branching ﬁbers, which form elaborate connections with other neurons. Formation of this complex communication system contributes to an enormous increase in size of the brain—from nearly 30 percent of its adult weight at birth to 70 percent by age 2 and 90 percent by age 6.57<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
Much research conﬁrms that overloading children with input leads to disorganization of behavior. Excessive stimulation also causes them to withdraw as they try to shield themselves from a stimulus deluge, thereby creating conditions that, paradoxically, are much like stimulus deprivation!61 These ﬁndings help us understand, from a brain-development perspective, the detrimental impact of excessive adult tutoring on young children, described earlier in this chapter. They also raise grave concerns about the recent proliferation of expensive commercial early learning centers, in which infants are barraged with letter and number ﬂashcards and slightly older toddlers are drenched in a full curriculum of reading, math, science, art, music, gym, and more.62 Rather than optimizing early neurological growth (as proponents claim), these eorts to jump-start young children can inﬂict considerable harm, robbing them of a healthy start on the road to maturity.63<n>Our rapidly expanding knowledge base on brain development and children’s learning reveals that a genetically inﬂuenced roadmap for brain growth and a developmentally appropriate environment go hand in hand; the impact of each depends on the other. Appropriate stimulation “wires” the brain, prompting it to form new connections and its regions to specialize. As this process goes forward, the brain gradually becomes receptive to increasingly complex and varied stimulation. This fosters further elaboration and specialization of brain structures and ever more advanced knowledge and skills.<n>temperament.  From the earliest ages, children vary greatly in preferences, interests, talents—and in temperament, or style of emotional responding, the most thoroughly studied of these sources of individual variation. Temperament encompasses activity level, ability to attend to stimuli, and capacity to adjust the intensity of emotions to a comfortable level so the child can remain adaptively engaged with his or her physical and social surroundings.64<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
Adivinanzas (Riddles)<n>Adivinanzas are riddles. Many Chicano children remember being entertained with riddles narrated by parents and grandparents. A riddle is an intellectual brainteaser, in Spanish called a quebracabeza; facts are framed in the form of a question in such a way that the respondent cannot possibly know the answer. An example in Spanish is, “Qué camina de cuatro patas por la mañana, dos patas en el medio día, y tres patas en la noche?” (What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night?) The answer is man, who as a child, in the “morning” of life, crawls on four legs; as an adult walks on two legs; and as an old man uses a cane for support, thus walking on three legs. Another example is a “true riddle,” which is a comparison of something to the unknown answer, and that something is described in the question. For example, “Tengo ojos y no miro; boca pero no hablo; qué soy?” (I have eyes and cannot see; a mouth, but cannot speak; What am I?) The answer is a photograph. Another type of riddle is the conundrum, where the answer is contained in the riddle itself, such as “Agua pasa por mi casa cate de mi corazon” (Water passes by my house pain of my heart). The answer is “agua-cate” (avocado). Or, “Lana sube, lana baja” (Wool goes up and wool goes down). The answer is “la navaja,” la-na-baja (the knife). Conundrums contain wordplay and in Chicano culture are sometimes bilingual, playing with words in both the Spanish and the English language. Another type of riddle is the riddling question, such as “Qué le dijo la luna al sol?” (What did the moon say to the sun?) The answer is “Eres tan grande y no te dejan salir de noche” (You are so big and yet are not allowed to go out at night).<n>Many Spanish riddles collected in the Southwest reflect in some way the characteristics of the Southwest, both linguistically and environmentally. Since the problem presented in a riddle is linguistically and culturally based on both the teller’s and the audience’s culture, they must all be members of the same community or group to comprehend the puzzle. Bilingual riddles, those narrated in both English and Spanish, are clearly a Chicano invention growing out of the bicultural experience. Riddles are fun and educational as well. It is usually children who enjoy telling and listening to riddles. Like other folklore genres, riddles serve a function, helping children learn to interpret facts and form an opinion. They use language, humor, and a verbal fun activity to challenge a child’s intellect.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt
Altars<n>An altar is a religious shrine (depending on its size, sometimes called an altarcito, a little altar) established in the home for the personal worship by the family. Home altars are common in many Mexican and Chicano homes. The word altar is derived from the Latin word altare, a combination of altus, high, and ara, altar, referring to a raised structure for worship, one that goes upward toward the sky or heaven. It provides a space where religious people can communicate with God, the saints, or other spiritual beings. Home altars vary in size, from a small shelf with one votive candle and one saint or statue, to a large table altar, with many religious images, La Virgen de Guadalupe, flowers, pictures of saints, candles; a structure that can fill up half a room. Permanent altars can be in a small nicho (niche) in the bedroom, the living room, or even the dining room. Daily devout prayer, such as reciting the rosary or praying to a patron or favorite saint, is a normal occurrence in many families, with the prayers often led by the mother or grandmother. A personal home altar may evolve over a period of years, rather than being constructed suddenly in one day. When the creation is such a gradual process, it can reflect and almost chronicle the happy and tragic events that take place in the family. As family members are born, or die, their picture or a favorite personal item of theirs may be placed on the altar, along with their patron saint, a votive candle, or flowers. Eventually, the altar can become so much a meaningful representation of the family that it will be maintained for years and even generations.<n>The religious observation of All Souls’ Day, or Día de los Muertos, on November 2, is an occasion for many families to erect altars specifically for a parent or other family member who has recently died. These altars will traditionally have a picture or pictures of the departed with offerings and gifts. Family and friends are invited to visit and add items to the altar, which becomes almost a shrine, and is called an ofrenda. In many U.S. cities Día de los Muertos ritual celebrations have become community affairs that include more than the Chicano community and may entail a procession through the streets ending at a local school or community center. In the last thirty or so years, the creation and construction of altars have become major art programs for museums, schools, and community centers in the United States. The altars are wonderful artistic creations, a form of folk art, with local artists participating and involving children in the making of calaveras (skeletons), papel picado (cut tissue paper), paper flowers, and other decorations.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt
“Ay Vienen los Yankees!” (Here Come the Yankees!)<n>This title of a song from early Mexican California vividly expresses fear of the loss of the Mexican culture. The song expresses an aversion to the cultural invasion of the Americans along with a fear that the Mexican women may like the Yankees too much. This song was collected in southern California and according to Hague, the “words date from 1848 or about that time” (109). It is an example of a folk custom the Mexicans used to convey their antipathy toward the Anglo culture. It goes like this:<n>Ay vienen los Yankees,<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt
A popularly narrated legend found throughout the Southwest, south Texas, and even parts of northern Mexico that tells of the appearance of the devil at community dances, dance halls, and discotheques. Called the “devil at the dance” legend or “devil haunts the dance hall” in folklore literature, it is considered to be an urban belief tale that has been adapted to contemporary situations. The devil makes his appearance elegantly dressed, usually in a suit; he is strikingly handsome, muy suave (smooth and poised), tall, and refined. Consequently, he stands out from among the rest of the men. Besides his stunning appearance, he is always an amazing dancer, knows the latest dance steps, and selects the prettiest girl to dance.<n>As the tale is often narrated, a disobedient young girl goes to the dance without her parents’ permission, or she goes against her mother’s express wishes. While at the dance a handsome beautifully dressed man asks her to dance. They dance all night, until she suddenly notices with a shock that he isn’t wearing shoes, and in fact he doesn’t even have feet; instead he has chicken feet, goat’s hooves, or a pig’s foot and a chicken foot. It is usually at this point, after he’s discovered, that he disappears into thin air, leaving the odor of sulfur in the air, or, in some versions of the legend, just runs out the door. The girl he was dancing with either faints or burns to death as she goes up in smoke. If the girl doesn’t die, as in some stories, she might suffer a burn on the shoulder or a man’s handprint might be found on her back. A small circle of people who are present at the dance observe this encounter, and the narrator of the story usually says that she or he heard it from someone who was there.<n>The lesson learned is that one must not disobey one’s parents, for the handsome man is known to be the devil and the personification of evil. It is noted that mostly women narrate these legends, among themselves or from mothers to daughters, in a didactic fashion, to instill fear in young women so that they will not disregard parental authority. In some variants a young girl specifically transgresses religious beliefs by insisting on going to a dance on Good Friday, a religious holy day, and a revered day of prayer in Chicano Catholic households. The appearance of the devil on this day is an especially ominous sign.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
“La Bamba”<n>The title of a song, as well as the title of a movie directed by Luis Valdez in 1987. The film is about the life of the Chicano singer Ritchie Valens, who recorded the song and made it very popular in 1958. The song actually goes back to early Mexican colonial history; it has been traced to 1790 when it was performed at the Coliseo Theatre in Mexico City. There are printed sources that cite the song being sung and danced in Veracruz during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By the 1830s it was also a popular dance in Mexican California.<n>“La Bamba” is considered to be a son jarocho (country folks’ dancing music), an example of the mestizo (mixed-race) musical tradition, with strong African influences, from the state of Veracruz. The instrumentation of the traditional son jarocho included a small harp, a small eight-string guitar (jarana), and a small four-string guitar (requinto). The dance that went with son jarocho was a zapateado, a foot-stomping dance. There are two different accounts about how Ritchie Valens learned the song, since he supposedly never learned Spanish. One source states that he heard the song on a short trip across the border into Mexico, and another states he learned the song from his uncle when he was five years old. His innovative style mixed jarocho music with a rock ‘n roll beat. His recorded version of “La Bamba” in 1958 is the first known U.S. recording. “La Bamba” has now been recorded more than 150 different times in the United States; for example, in 1966 by Trini Lopez, in 1979 by the Plugz, and in 1980 by Los Lobos. The Rice University Marching Band and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir have also recorded it. The movie, with the soundtrack recorded by Los Lobos, was very successful with mainstream audiences and launched the acting careers of several Latino actors.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
Cemetery and graveyard decorating traditions have been researched and written about as a means of appreciating and understanding Mexican folk beliefs about death and grieving. The adornment of grave sites reflects religious folk practices, and ethnic and family attitudes about death and remembrance. Some of the customs include decorating and designing a space that will be revisited by a family for many generations. The intent is to keep the deceased person alive in the family’s memory. Some design motifs that are distinctive to Chicano cemeteries are the construction and design of crosses. Terry Jordan’s book has an illustration of twelve different “subtypes of wooden Latin crosses found on Mexican graves in Texas” (78). In the nineteenth and even into the twentieth century crosses were built of wood, but these didn’t last long, being destroyed either by the elements or by vandalism. More common today are crosses made of molded concrete. Many grave sites have a cerquito, a low wood, metal, or concrete fence, an enclosure that surrounds an individual grave. Another common trait is to construct a cement grave marker, with a nicho (niche) built into it, so that the statue of a saint, La Virgen de Guadalupe, or a photograph of the deceased can be placed in it. Sometimes a concrete cross will have a nicho built into its base for the same purpose. Although fresh flowers are often placed at grave sites, paper and plastic flowers are more common. Colorful plastic wreaths are sometimes attached to the wooden or cement cross. Another dis-tinguishing feature in Chicano camposantos is the wide range of materials used in decorating a grave. As with home yard shrines and home altars, everyday objects are used as personal and artistic statements. It is often in the performance of highly charged personal rituals that people create folklore, folk art, and folk music.<n>Many grave markers are brightly painted, and some even have religious scenes painted on them. This tradition has been linked to Mexico’s indigenous heritage, for, as Terry Jordan states, “Such use of color in a sacred context has ample pre-Columbian precedent in Mexico, where even the huge pyramids once bore bright paints” (80). He goes on to say, “Hispanic graveyards are places of color, where paints, flowers, and tiles combine to comfort the bereaved and startle the gringo” (88).<n>See also Altars; Folk Art; Nichos<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chC.txt
This is the name of probably the most famous legendary woman found in Greater Mexico. The ancient legend of La Llorona has been traced to pre-Columbian times in Mexico, and there is continuing discussion whether it may also have medieval European origins. Most Chicanos heard of her as children, read about her in literature, or learned of her from friends. La Llorona, meaning “the weeping woman” or “the howling woman,” may be represented as an Indian woman, an ugly old witch, or a beautiful woman in white with long flowing hair. She always appears late at night, and her crying and weeping can be vividly heard as she shrieks, “Ayyy, mis hijos!” (Oh, my children!).<n>According to the tragic legend, there once was a woman who was abandoned by her husband, or lover, and left with two or three children. Angry and seeking revenge, she kills her children by throwing them into a river, or sometimes by other means. When she realizes what she’s done, she goes insane. She is condemned to spend eternity searching for her lost and dead children. Consequently she is often heard in the night calling her children. She frequents rivers and other bodies of water, and is sometimes seen floating above the water looking, searching for her children. Her legend has been recited for over 300 years, and in contemporary times she is still believed to be wandering the streets in large cities, as well as in the small towns of the Southwest where numerous people report encounters with her. At times she is seen as a beautiful woman, wearing a white dress, roaming back streets and country roads, crying and weeping. Sometimes she becomes visible to the wayward husband who is out late, drinking, and when he approaches her, she turns into an ugly horse-faced hag, scaring him into swearing abstinence forever. Parents use her name to scare little children into obedience: “Hay viene La Llorona . . . portaté bien” (The Llorona is coming, behave yourself). Even adults who’ve heard the story many times and do not want to admit belief still fear a late-night encounter with La Llorona.<n>There are ancient texts of indigenous mythology narrated by the Aztecs and recorded by the Spaniards that very closely resemble the La Llorona legend. In some tales she is believed to be Cihuacoatl, the patron goddess of women who die in childbirth. It is said that Cihuacoatl carried a little baby cradle on her back, or a dead baby in her arms, as she roamed the country crying through the nights. Those who saw her considered it an ill omen. Sahagún mentions in The Conquest of Mexico that “a woman was often heard [as] she went weeping and crying out. Loudly did she call out at night. She walked about saying: ‘O my beloved sons, now we are about to go!’” (Horcasitas and Butterworth, 208). Horcasitas and Butterworth reprint several texts of these early chronicles. Diego Muñoz Camargo (ca. 1529–1599) also reported that before the Spaniards arrived, “many times and many nights was heard the voice of a woman who cried out in a loud voice, drowning herself with her tears, and with great sobs and sighs, wailing” (Horcasitas and Butterworth, 209).<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
The painting and decorating of the exterior and interior of the car are very important for appearances, personal identity, and also for belonging to a car club and participating in car shows. The interior may be upholstered in crushed velvet, red or black, have wall-to-wall carpeting, a bar, a chandelier, a TV, and a stereo tape deck. The exterior may be painted in two tones, a lacquer mixed with iridescent flakes, or have a pearl finish. Sometimes the undercarriage is chromed and gold-plated. Painting low-rider cars is a specialty only available at certain paint and body shops, so low riders must be aware of such businesses. Besides the painting of the car, other decorative designs or motifs may also be applied, such as pinstriping, fancy lace (a fire design), and murals. Murals of an Aztec or Mayan scene or La Virgen de Guadalupe are popular icons painted on the trunk, hood, or roof of the car. Even though there is similarity in the styles, each car is very different in the final production. There are many techniques employed to arrive at a unique personal style. For instance accessories from different-year models are interchanged, such as side panels from a 1957 model may be cut and welded to a 1952 car, or “’57 Cadillac tail lamps on a ’62 Chevy Impala” (Bright, 196).<n>Low riders are usually young urban Chicanos, between the ages of eighteen and thirty, and there can be two and three generations of low riders in one family. The cost of fixing and maintaining a low-rider car is fairly high, so the owner typically is a working person. Since finding older cars, say from the 1950s, is becoming difficult, some low riders now customize small trucks, motorcycles, and bicycles as well. The movie Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life) depicts the work that goes into customizing a pickup truck.<n>Cruising involves driving very slowly up and down city streets, such as Mission Street in San Francisco, Whittier Boulevard in Los Angeles, and King and Story Roads in San Jose, California. The objective of cruising is to socialize, to see and be seen, to give others the opportunity to admire one’s car and to admire the other cars; consequently the driving must be very slow, muy despacito. Driving a great customized car, beautifully painted, is a unique experience for the low rider. Cruising slowly and smoothly, sitting low in the driver’s seat, glancing out at the street, nodding the head slightly when being recognized, all these make up an experience only a Chicano low rider who has invested lots of time and money in his car can appreciate. Cruising is often compared to the custom of promenading around a plaza, referred to as el paseo in many Latin American and Mexican cities. In this sense, the low-rider car becomes a cultural vehicle, as represented by the artist Gilbert Lujan in his series titled “Cultural Vehicles.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
A milagro is literally a miracle, but in folk religious practices milagros are tiny objects presented to a saint at a shrine or church, as a token or offering intended to fulfill a vow made to that saint. Sometimes these objects are called ex-votos, meaning “from a vow,” and are in the shape of the object that symbolizes what the vow was about. For example the milagro could be in the shape of an arm, heart, leg, or baby. In Mexico and the Southwest such vows may be called promesas or mandas and can be fulfilled by prayers, pilgrimages, and promised visits to a saint’s shrine if the wish or favor is granted. This is an important folk religious tradition common among Latinos and Chicanos in the Southwest, Mexico, and throughout Latin America. A mother may make a promesa to La Virgen de Guadalupe, to visit her shrine in Guadalajara, if her daughter is cured of breast cancer. When the promesa is fulfilled this mother may leave a tiny silver breast, a milagro, to symbolize the realization of the promesa.<n>Milagros are made out of wood, wax, or bone, but the most common material is silver or a silverlike metal, and they are usually very tiny objects, about one inch in diameter. The custom of offerings to saints goes back hundreds of years and can be traced to the Mediterranean among pre-Christian Greeks, Romans, and Iberians. The tradition as it has evolved in the New World is an amalgamation of African, Native American, and Spanish beliefs. Saints are very important among Chicano Catholics, influencing every aspect of daily life and acting as mediators between man and God. Promesas made to saints and the milagros presented are a reflection of their strong predominance in daily life. In the Southwest, this custom has been documented since the colonial period and was undoubtedly introduced by the Spanish missionaries.<n>It is known that Hernán Cortés, the conqueror of Mexico, had a milagro made in the shape of a gold scorpion, which he offered to the patroness of his home, Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Guadalupe, Spain. This was in thanks for surviving the bite of a scorpion that he received in Yautepec, Mexico, in 1528. In the past most milagros were commissioned, and the local silversmith made them out of silver or sometimes gold. Today they are mass-produced and can be bought at religious stores. Thousands may be found in various shrines, cathedrals, and on saints’ clothing throughout the Southwest and of course in Mexico. The milagros are pinned to the clothing of the saint and left there until collected by the priest or caretaker of the church.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
These retablos may be painted for a specific saint in gratitude for a favor granted, or in praise of the powers of the saint. For example, Durand and Massey have compiled and written about the many retablos to the Virgen de San Juan de los Lagos in Mexico. The paintings usually depict an event survived or celebrated, an illness, an operation, imprisonment, or having received a passport to the United States, or they may depict a person praying to the saint. A few sentences written on the retablo express the favor granted, starting with the words “Doy gracias” or “Doy infinitas gracias a la Santisima Virgen de San Juan de los Lagos” (I give thanks, I give infinite thanks to the most holy Virgin of San Juan of the Lakes) and the reason for the retablo is written out, with the location and date added at the end.<n>Another expression for this religious art is retablo ex-voto, a votive painting created in payment to a saint according to a vow. The Latin term ex voto means “from a vow,” so the ex-voto is specifically created to complete a vow made to a particular saint. Other retablos may be painted in gratitude for something gained or accomplished but not because a vow was made. A retablo ex-voto is a work of art, a religious painting, and also a historical document. The painting depicts the favor or miracle that occurred, the holy image or saint responsible for the miracle, and a short text that describes what occurred, including the location and date of the event. The text describing the event may begin with “Doy Gracias” (I give thanks) and express a need to state the miraculous event and tell how at the moment of crisis “me encomendó a la Virgen” (I entrusted myself to the Virgin). The text usually ends “por eso dedico este retablo” (this is why I dedicate this retablo). The retablo is then placed in a church or a shrine devoted to that particular saint. The tradition of creating votive paintings goes back hundreds of years in Mexico, and can be found along the U.S.-Mexican border region and in the cities of the Southwest. Many people immigrating from Mexico, for instance, have painted or commissioned a retablo in gratitude for surviving a disaster or an illness. Art exhibits in the United States have shown retablos ex-votos that depict the treacherous experience of immigrating to the United States.<n>See also Mandas<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chR.txt
La Vieja Inés y Los Listones (The Old Mother Game)<n>A very old game played by little girls that is known by various names. It is called Los Colores (the colors), Los Listones (the ribbons), and Tan Tan. The main players are la mamá and “Saint Inez,” who may also be called La Vieja Inés (Old Lady Inés) or La Virgen Inés (Old Maid Inés). All of the other players are given a color by the mamá: red, yellow, green, blue, or they may choose their own color. La Vieja Inés comes and pretends to knock on the door, Tan, tan. The mother asks, “Quién es?” (Who is it?) and the answer is “La Vieja Inés.” The mother asks, “Que quieres?” (What do you want?). “Quiero colores” is the answer. “Que color quieres?” (What color do you want?) “Quiero verde” (I want green), or any color is mentioned. The little girl whose color is mentioned runs away and La Vieja Inés tries to catch her before she reaches a spot designated as home base. The game goes on until all of the colors have been chosen and all of the girls are caught. In some versions the girls carry ribbons, each of a different color. Scholars who have analyzed the game point to the socialization of gender roles for little girls, and the game serves as a lesson in the inevitable eventual separation from the safety of home. This was one of the games collected by the Federal Writers’ Program in New Mexico during the 1930s. Although there were many games played by Hispano and Mexican children, this one appears to be one with a long historical tradition.<n>Jose Limón has written about a version found in Texas. It is an ancient game that can be traced to medieval Spain, to a place called Zafra. In the version from Zafra two teams are involved, one representing evil, the other goodness. One team is led by the devil, el demonio, and the other by an angel, ángel de la guarda (angel of the guard). Each player is named a color, and the two leaders, the devil and the angel, try to gain the most players. In this version it is a battle between good and evil to see who can win the most souls.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chV.txt
Yardas (Gardens)<n>Although the Spanish word for garden is jardín, many Chicano families favor the term “yard” while referring to their gardens, pronouncing it in Spanish as yarda. Although yarda appears to be a pochismo (Chicano slang), it can be found in Cassell’s Spanish Dictionary. The layout and organizational aesthetics of Chicano yardas are unique enough that folklorists and cultural geographers have written about them. Many yardas can aesthetically constitute yard art, even though it does not appear that this is the intent of the creator. Besides planting shrubs, flowers, and sometimes grass, the gardener will bring into play the creativity that goes into decorating a yard unconsciously, with the result being a folk art display. Invariably, a yard will contain many potted flowers arranged in a patterned manner. The central focus of many yards is often a devotional shrine set up in memory of a family member, with a nicho housing a saint or Madonna, and the design of the yard’s plants and flowers is laid out in reference to the shrine. Some yardas may not have planted grass, but instead hard-packed dirt that is kept free of weeds, swept frequently, and kept prepared for family gatherings. But trees, preferably fruit trees, abound to make shade for family gatherings and outdoor cooking.<n>A common practice among many working-class Mexican Americans is to recycle as much as possible, although the concept that recycling is an environmentally correct thing to do is not always known. Common recycled objects that can be found in yards are tables, kitchen pots, painted tin cans, and car tires used as planters. Tires are cut across the width, making two containers, opened up and cut with a scalloped design around the edges. After being painted and filled with flowers and plants, these plant containers do not even resemble their original form. Recycled tire planters can line a driveway or establish the boundaries of a large yard. The practice of reusing objects that have lost their original purpose, such as kitchen pitchers and pots, is a means of keeping something familiar, something associated with a memory, alive and finding a new use for it. This practice probably originates from poverty, but the historical result has been that it creates its own aesthetic in adding adornment to one’s home and life. These “yardscapes,” as they’ve come to be called, are composed of bits and pieces of one’s personal life and as such can add visual charm and historical value to a home. A family’s religious and cultural values, as well as the special identity of being Mexican American, can be found in yardas.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chY.txt
The anchor for this new conception of government—a government that intervenes in private choices in order to protect individuals from exploitation—lies in the Thirteenth Amendment. Yet, it seems very ambitious to derive all of this from a black-letter prohibition against private arrangements of “slavery and involuntary servitude.” The fact is that we are not entirely sure how far we should extend the prohibition against unjust relationships of domination. At the time the amendment was enacted, it was fairly clear that the drafters and the public had a broad construction in mind, for the Thirteenth Amendment became the constitutional foundation in 1866 for the first Civil Rights Act—indeed, the Act that is still used today to prosecute those who, like the police who beat up Rodney King, engage in racially motivated deprivations of civil rights.17 Because the deprivations of civil rights were understood to be an instantiation of relationships of unjust domination, it is clear that the framers envisioned a new constitutional order much broader than merely business as usual, just without slavery.<n>Academic writers have found the Thirteenth Amendment a rich source for constitutional speculation. Some have claimed that the amendment goes so far as to require the government to be watchful and intervene against child abuse.18 Others have argued that the amendment offers convincing grounds for recognizing abortion rights. Requiring a mother to carry a child to term arguably amounts to an oppressive form of involuntary servitude.19 A third voice holds, much in line with the argument of this book, that the potential ambit of “involuntary servitude” includes all forms of employment and labor that are unjust and oppressive.20 These are imaginative readings, and others are possible.21<n>Some restraint is necessary. We have to be mindful of the prospect that the values of the Secret Constitution might play themselves out more effectively as the informal restraints of civil society rather than as binding rules of law. As we have seen, our impulse to promote religion, love for the nation, and “politically correct” speech seems to yield greater results when the state holds back and limits itself to a gentle nudge in the right direction. But, more significantly, we have to recognize that we are locked in ongoing contradiction between the values of our first and our second constitutions.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt
Indifference toward the victim began to change with the Thirteenth Amendment. For the first time, the people who must bear the cross of involuntary servitude became the focus of attention. They would no longer suffer in the United States. The federal government had the duty to protect them. The government also asserted its duty to protect the weak in the Prohibition Amendment, but, alas, the duty to help others is not always easily realized. Yet, the idea that the government should protect the weak, that it should tender compassion for victims, became a mainstay of the Secret Constitution.<n>Of course, no one is constitutionally protected in the action of committing a crime. The rights attach to those suspected of crime. The purpose of the amendments is to insure both that innocent persons will not be convicted but just as critically to protect the dignity of every suspect as he or she falls under the investigative and prosecuting power of the state. For example, the privilege against self-incrimination goes beyond the protection of the innocent to speak to the dignity of the suspect who may remain silent. Similarly, the protection of the home and private papers often deters the efficiency of law enforcement, but only for the sake of promoting personal privacy. So long as we recognize that the constitutional provisions are interlaced with dignity concerns, then we cannot properly disregard the claims of victims to be treated in the same way. The victims’ rights movement focuses, therefore, on increasing the participation of victims in various stages of the process. Participation itself helps enhance the dignity of the victim by allowing him or her to be heard and to feel respected as a citizen.<n>The most common problem faced by victims is that they are not allowed to attend the trials of those who have allegedly assaulted or raped them or killed members of their families. The trial of Timothy McVeigh for bombing the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 and killing 168 people provides dramatic proof of indifference to discrimination against the interests of victims. First, federal Judge Richard Matsch changed the venue of the trial from Oklahoma City to Denver, which of course made it much more difficult for the murdered victims’ families to attend the trial. The nominal reason for the change of venue was that McVeigh was more likely to receive an unbiased jury in a city several hundred miles away. The likelihood of finding potential jurors, in Denver or anywhere else in the United States, unaffected by the intensive media coverage of the bombing was thought to be minimal. The other factor influencing the judge’s decision to relocate the trial in Denver was the politely undiscussed fact that he owned a ranch outside of Denver. It suited his personal interests to be close to home.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
The Supreme Court has remained remarkably unaffected by the academic swing toward support for hate speech legislation. In the R.A.V. case, for example, the Court struck down a municipal ordinance that punished the display of a symbol that one knows or has reason to know “arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.”21 Academic critics of the decision stress the value of regulating speech that has the effect, it is argued, of silencing minorities.22 The overriding value, they claim, is the equality of those affected by hate speech. Only by restricting intimidating speech, the argument goes, can all potential participants in the democratic dialogue feel free to speak and to make their opinions known. In the courts, however, the ancien principles still reign. The primary value is not equality but freedom.<n>But the government’s staying its hand does not mean that hate speech goes unsanctioned. Civil society has it own spontaneous means of chastising those who veer too far from the acceptable range of discourse. The best remedy against the “Auschwitz lie,” as the Germans call it, is to ignore it. Deborah Lipstadt, in her book Denying the Holocaust, wrote that we should not publicly debate unacceptable as well as obviously false claims, and thus she advanced a remedy as powerful as governmental censorship. When civil society turns a deaf ear, crazy ideas lose their edge. The remedy disturbed one historian labeled a “denier” so much that in late 1999 he unsuccessfully sued Lipstadt for libel, primarily to force her to confront his claims.23<n>In other areas, where racist and sexist speech wounds, the spontaneous order of American society has been uncannily effective in changing patterns of speech. Consider the careful choice of words in this book. I do not write “Negro” or “colored,” as people were wont to do not long ago. “Black” and “African American” have become the norm, and it all happened without government’s uttering a sound. When governmental officials try to tell people how to talk, they look slightly ridiculous. Witness the French trying to outlaw the use of the word “cheeseburger” and other insidious harbingers of American culture. However strong the value of preserving the French language in all its purity, the task is not one for government. At a certain point we have to trust the unplanned, powerful forces of civil society.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
There have been several responses to this issue, some raised prior to Smolin’s work. One is based on a view of multiple universes and the “weak anthropic principle.” This principle states that there exist multiple universes, but only those universes that were complex would sport life forms with the wit to wonder why their universe was complex. So the very fact that we humans are here to wonder about this issue merely means that we happen to be in one of the complex universes among vastly many universes. The argument is at least coherent. But it’s hard to be thrilled by this answer.<n>The “strong anthropic principle” goes further  indeed, too far  and posits that, for mysterious reasons, the universe is contrived such that life must arise to observe it and wonder at it. Few think the strong anthropic principle counts as science in any guise.<n>Smolin points out that there are two possible answers to the puzzle of the complexity of the universe. Either we will find a parameter-free description  a kind of supertheory  that yields something like our complex universe with its constants, or some historical process must pick those constants. Smolin proposes the possibility of “cosmic natural selection.” Here, daughter universes are born of black holes. Universes with more black holes will have more daughter universes. Given minor heritable variation in the constants of the laws of the daughter universes, cosmic natural selection will select for universes whose constants support the formation of a near-maximum number of black holes. He then argues that on very crude calculations most alterations in the known constants would be expected to lower the number of black holes. Lee points out that his theory is testable, for example, by deducing that our constants correspond to near-maximum black hole production, and that his theory has not been ruled out yet.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt
Morowitz then considers the equilibrium ratio of chain-extending bonds to all bonds, chain-extending plus chain-terminating, that would occur as a function of temperature, or equivalently, the energy per unit volume of the system. At very high temperatures, the system is a plasma, and chain-terminating bonds are vastly more predominant at equilibrium than chain-extending bonds. At very low temperatures, chain-terminating bonds predominate overwhelmingly.<n>If one plots the equilibrium ratio of chain-extending bonds to all bonds as a function of temperature, or energy per unit volume, the curve goes up, reaches a single peak, then trends downward. Thus, there is an optimal temperature, or energy per unit volume, where the equilibrium ratio of bonds maximizes the ratio of chain-extending chemical bonds to all bonds. Morowitz’s remarkable conclusion is that the maximum of this curve, where chain-extending bonds are as abundant as possible at equilibrium, corresponds quite closely to the average energy per unit volume of the biosphere of the Earth!<n>Even if the calculation is crude, I find this result deeply interesting. It suggests that, somehow, the biosphere has achieved an energy per unit volume such that at equilibrium chain-extending bonds are maximized. But this means that the energy requirements to form a biosphere of high molecular diversity are minimized!<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
The wonderful result that Scott and friends showed is a phase transition from Ksat expressions that are almost certainly satisfiable to Ksat expressions that are almost certainly not satisfiable (Figure .).<n>In Figure ., the horizontal axis is labeled C/V. Thus, the x-axis shows the ratio of clauses to variables, hence, on average, how many clauses each variable is in. Obviously, as each variable is in more and more of the C clauses, with randomly assigned truth requirements, Vi versus not-Vi, the chance that the set of clauses can be jointly satisfied gets harder. On the other hand, as K goes up, there are more variables per clause, any one of which, if satisfied, satisfies the clause since the variables within a clause are joined by “or.” Thus, as K goes up, the problem gets easier.<n>Remarkably, there is a phase transition on the C/V axis at ln x (K) or . x K. As shown in Figure ., for C/V values less than this phase transition value, the expression is almost certainly satisfiable. As C/V passes the . x K critical value, the probability that the expression can be satisfied plunges to near zero.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
Importantly, it is easy to create systems that are not readily adaptable by mutation and selection. What follows is not quite a theorem (and was discussed in At Home in the Universe), but it will do. Many of the readers of this book are competent programmers. Consider a typical program, say written in C, Java, or some other language. Perhaps it computes something as simple as the square roots of the first two million integers. Perhaps it simulates an ecosystem. Whatever that program does, imagine trying to evolve it by making random mutations in the code.<n>We all know what would happen. Most mutations of a computer program are of major eect. The program won’t compile. If it compiles, it generates some vast stream of symbolic nonsense or goes into an undetected infinite loop and “hangs.”<n>And we can make the matter substantially worse by eliminating redundancy in the code. Any computer program can be written as a sequence of binary, and , symbols, where that sequence represents the input data to the program and the program itself.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
Here is how the toy model works. Each species is represented by a single individual. Hence, the species is assumed to be isogenic, except during the rapid evolution to fitter genotypes that happens as a fitter mutant of a species steps from one point to another point on the landscape. Very rapidly, it outreproduces its less-fit cousins. Hence, in this limit, the entire species can be said to hop between points on the landscape.<n>At each move of the computer program, any of four events may happen. A given species is chosen at random. First, it may do nothing. Second, it may change its genotype, and if the result is that it is fitter in interacting with its ecosystem neighbors, that innovation will be accepted. The creature has evolved on its landscape and probably deformed the landscapes of its neighbors. Third, the critter can change the ruggedness of its landscape by increasing K or decreasing K. Landscapes become more rugged and multipeaked as K increases. The move altering K is accepted only if that move makes the current genotype of the creature fitter. Hence, altering the ruggedness of the fitness landscape must pay o for the creature immediately and is accepted selfishly. The fourth thing that can happen is rather mean. A random other creature, say, Godzilla, is chosen to attempt to invade the current species niche. A copy of Godzilla, Godzilla’, connects to the first species’ ecosystem neighbors and has a go. If Godzilla’ is fitter when coupled to the first species’ econeighbors than that species, that species goes extinct in its niche and is replaced by Godzilla’.<n>By the fourth mechanism, if Godzilla’ happens to have a beneficial landscape ruggedness due to its K value, that good landscape ruggedness has now replicated from the initial Godzilla to its copy. So good landscape ruggedness can spread, by natural selection, through the model ecosystem, hence, landscape ruggedness can evolve.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
By the fourth mechanism, if Godzilla’ happens to have a beneficial landscape ruggedness due to its K value, that good landscape ruggedness has now replicated from the initial Godzilla to its copy. So good landscape ruggedness can spread, by natural selection, through the model ecosystem, hence, landscape ruggedness can evolve.<n>The results are shown in Figure .. Indeed, landscape ruggedness does evolve to an intermediate ruggedness. During this evolution, the mean interval between extinction events increases dramatically, hence, the mean number of extinction events decreases. In this sense, all the creatures that remain become fitter due to the coevolutionary tuning of landscape ruggedness. In addition, when Godzilla’ replaces the hapless species that now goes extinct, its econeighbors find themselves interacting with Godzilla’ itself. They may not be as fit interacting with Godzilla’ as with the first species, hence, they too may be invaded and driven extinct in turn.<n>In short, avalanches of extinction events can propagate. Figure . shows that the distribution is a power law, with many small and few large extinction events. Moreover, once a new species comes into existence, say, Godzilla’, it may not fare well in its new niche, hence, may go extinct soon. But if it lasts in its niche, it may be well adapted, hence, resistant to being driven extinct. The results (Figure .a) are a power law distribution of species lifetimes.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
This fact suggests that the optimal prediction of a short sequence of data is obtained by a model of intermediate complexity  a few Fourier modes, neither a single one nor very many. The sense of bounded rationality Vince and I want to advocate is that optimal prediction of a limited time series is achieved with models using only a few Fourier modes, or their analogs in other basis sets  models of modest, or bounded, complexity.<n>The rest of the theory Vince and I have developed goes to show that agents who have theories of one another and act selfishly based on those theories will typically create a persistently changing pattern of actions. Therefore, they persistently create a nonstationary world in which only the relatively recent past has valid data. Thus, there is always only a limited amount of valid data on which to base theories, and the agents, in turn, must always build models of intermediate, bounded complexity to avoid over- or underfitting the meager valid data.<n>Natural rationality is, in this sense, bounded. It is bounded because we mutually create nonstationary worlds. What happens is that the agents act under their theories. But in due course some agent acts in a way that falsifies the theories of one or more other agents. These agents either are stubborn or change their theories. If they change their theories of the first agent, then typically they also change their actions. In turn, those changes disconfirm the theory of the first agent, and perhaps still other agents. So the agents wind up in a space of coevolving theories and actions with no fixed-point, stable steady states, which means that past actions are a poor guide to future actions by an agent since his theories, and hence his action plans, have changed. But this means that the agents mutually create a “nonstationary” time series of actions (nonstationary just means that the statistical characteristics of the time series keep changing because the agents keep changing their theories and actions). In turn, the agents typically have only a modest amount of relatively recent data that is still valid and reliable on which to base their next theories of one another. Given only a modest amount of valid and reliable data, the agents must avoid overfitting or underfitting that smallish amount of data, so they must use theories of intermediate complexity  for example, four Fourier modes to fit the data, not one or twenty.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
In due course, the conditions are met to begin construction of partial objects on the way to the entire chair. Legs, then backs, begin to be assembled as screws and nails are used up. Eventually, a seat is constructed too, and the first chair triumphantly follows.<n>All goes well until all the screws are used up. The seat, having relied on screws and screwdrivers to attach padding, goes nuts and looks about frantically, asking the screwdriver to work on nails. No luck. Eventually, the seat tries nails and hammers jointly, and that complementary pair works. More chairs are constructed, then nails run out and failures propagate throughout the system.<n>Not a metaphor, the technology graph. Rather, a new tool to understand the general principles of robust constructibility, the structure of economic webs, a knowledge-management tool for a firm, a new hunk of basic science. Indeed, one of the interesting features of technology graphs is that they constitute the proper conceptual framework to consider process and product design simultaneously.

That may have been the case some years ago, but modern development has strongly interfered with its once distinctive appearance. You can judge for yourself by ascending the bell tower of the parish church (which also goes by the name of Nossa Senhora do Rosário), which you will find by winding your way through the narrow streets back to the Praça da Restauração (you may have to ask for access to the tower in the sacristy). Founded by King Dom Pedro II in 1698, the church has an impressive, scroll-decorated Baroque façade, brilliant white dome, stone belltower, and a chapel at the rear, Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos (Our Lady of the Afflicted), where women often pray when their fishermen husbands are away at sea.<n>Instead of the red-tiled roofs and filigreed chimneys seen elsewhere in the Algarve, the Olhão skyline comprises flat-topped roofs of terraces called açoeitas. Look hard and you can still see the narrow, outside staircases leading to white-washed towers, where fishermen’s wives, or perhaps smugglers, would look out for the incoming fleet.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
Cross the river via Magere Brug then travel one block north and take a left along the northern bank of the Herengracht Canal. Here you will get your first glimpse of the canal system which was built during Amsterdam’s Golden Age and revolutionized the city. During its time, probably the most sought after and expensive real estate in the world. Herengracht particularly has many beautiful houses which can really only be appreciated by an afternoon strolling by them (see box page 66). This part of town is still mostly residential and many houses have been converted into apartments for successful Amsterdammers. It is fascinating to peek inside at the ultra-modern interiors, which give a feel of the flair the Dutch seem to have for interior design.<n>At number 605 Herengracht, Museum Willet-Holthuysen gives you the opportunity to look behind the façade of a genuine Golden Age house. It was completed in 1690 and structurally has been altered very little since that time, although it has been changed cosmetically several times as fashions changed. In 1855 it came into the possession of the Holthuysen family. Pieter Holthuysen was a successful trader in glass and English coal (which goes to prove that you didn’t need to trade in exotic goods to become wealthy). After the death of Pieter and his wife, the house is bequeathed to their daughter Louisa who later married Abraham Willet. He had a love of art and was a founding member of the Royal Antiquarian Society — a society whose aim was to promote national art and history. On her death in 1895 Louisa bequeathed the house and its contents to the city of Amsterdam on condition that it would be opened as a museum. This it duly did in 1896. You will be able to examine in detail the furniture, porcelain, and numerous artworks collected by the family.<n>Travel further along Herengracht to the end of the second block. Here you will find one of the most fascinating views of the canal ring. From the bridge it is possible to see 14 other bridges by looking up and down Herengracht and ahead down the adjoining Reguliersgracht (this view is even better at water level, so take a canal cruise — and your camera!). Reguliersgracht has some very pretty houses and is quieter than the main three “girdle” canals built at this time.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
North from Zea harbor is another pretty harbor, Mikrolimani (Small Harbor) or Tourkolimani, where you’ll find the fishing fleet and some good fish tavernas. Or head south towards the main historical attractions of Piraeus.<n>From the south side of Zea harbor it is only a short walk to the Archaeological Museum of Piraeus. The rather dour building hides a treasure-trove of statuary and other artifacts found during excavation of the ancient shrines of the city, and communal buildings such as the Agora. Pride of place goes to the Piraeus Kouros, the oldest full-size bronze figure depicting the god Apollo. On the grounds of the museum are scant remains of the ancient Theater of Zea.<n>Walking further south along the promenade past remnants of the ancient sea wall brings you to another small bay where you will find the Hellenic Maritime Museum, a semicircular museum with small garden in front complete with cannon. Rooms display an eclectic series of artifacts with dioramas of the great Battle of Salamis in 480 b.c., letters from the naval heroes of Greek independence, and numerous items salvaged from the seas around the Attica coastline.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
Around the shoreline of San Salvador are four separate places that are purported to be the site of Columbus’s landing. No one will ever know for sure, of course, but the competition continues. After the Spaniards went on to other islands in the Caribbean, the island became a base for English pirate John Watling; indeed until 1926 it was known as Watling’s Island.<n>The interior of San Salvador is dotted with lakes; there is a great deal of marshy land and only one major road. Cockburn Town (pronounced “KOE-burn”) is the capital. Pride of place in the town goes to the small jail found by the main coast road. It’s now a museum because, as one resident said, “we don’t have no need for no jail.” (The opening hours are irregular.)<n>The main road leads around the circumference of the island. Heading south from Cockburn Town you’ll first come to Long Bay, the “official” site of Columbus’s landing. It is marked by a plain white cross that sits bright and stark against the azure-blue ocean on the seaward side of the road. The area has been designated as Landfall Park. Another monument, to the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, sits a little way from the cross. This depiction of the Olympic rings on a circular plinth is here because the Olympic flame was brought to San Salvador on its way to Mexico.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
West of Klungkung, a narrow lane leads to the village of Tihingan, one of only two places in Bali where the gongs for gamelan orchestras are made. The other is Sawan, near the north coast (see page 65). In any of the bronze foundries, you’ll find the same medieval scene, with a boy apprentice pumping the bellows to keep a charcoal fire blazing while the smiths hammer away. Hanging mats keep the place in semi-darkness so that the workers can judge the temperature of the glowing metal by its color. In the village of Banda, about 5 km (3 miles) south of Tihinga, a museum celebrates one of Bali’s most successful contemporary artists, Nyoman Gunarsa.<n>On the eastern periphery of Klungkung a bridge crosses the gorge of the Unda river, which is used as a big communal bath every afternoon as the sun goes down. Ash, mud, and floods from the 1963 eruption of Gunung Agung devastated this part of the island, and the effects are still felt today, as its agriculture has not yet fully recovered from the disaster.<n>Goa Lawah<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Mengwi<n>Just to the northwest of Kapal, there’s a major road junction. The right fork goes north to Bedugul (see page 61) and Singaraja, but you only have to go 3 km (2 miles) to reach the town of Mengwi, where you’ll find one of Bali’s most beautiful temples.<n>Pura Taman Ayun, near the center of town, was built in 1634 and renovated in 1937. It’s notable for its double moat. Every morning as well as late in the afternoon, people use the wide outer moat for washing themselves and their clothes. You can circle the outside of the wall that surrounds the inner compound and look in at the cluster of merus (pagoda-like, multi-roofed towers). Meru towers may only contain an odd number of roofs.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Practically every brochure for Bali shows this exotic sea temple on its rocky islet, often silhouetted against the setting sun. Inevitably, tour buses converge here in late afternoon so everyone can take that same picture. It is 10 km (6 miles) down a narrow side road from Kediri to the coast, and there can be a long procession of traffic. You might like to plan a dawn visit instead, avoiding at least some of the hawkers who congregate later in the day. Tanah Lot is believed to have been founded in the 16th century by the Javanese priest Nirarta, who dedicated it to the sea god. Now the sea threatens to undermine the rock on which it stands, and concrete breakwaters have been positioned to hold back the waves. Nothing, however, is done to hold back the commercial tide. Ever more souvenir stands and food stalls cluster as near as they can get, and the nearby coast is being developed as a huge, and controversial, resort complex.<n>But the former raja’s capital of Tabanan goes about its business with few concessions to tourism. The Dutch burned the palace here in 1906, so the heart of the old town is gone, but Tabanan remains a center for music and dance. Kerambitan, just off the main road to the southwest, is a pretty town with three palaces, still the property of a princely family. Today, one of the palaces, the Puri Anyar, acts as an aristocratic type of homestay, where guests can experience the traditional hospitality that might have been extended to honored visitors in the past.<n>The main road reaches the coast at Soka, with two small beaches and occasional good surfing waves. Balian Beach is similar, with informal bungalow accommodations. Experienced surfers head west to Medewi, where simple but pleasant new cottage-style hotels face a mostly rocky shore with a small beach.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
entertainment<n>Spaniards have earned a reputation as consummate partiers, and while Barcelona may not be as fanatical about late nights as Madrid, it is still a place that really swings when the sun goes down. It has virtually every kind of nightlife diversion, from cool cabarets to live jazz, rock, flamenco, and world beat to opera, and a thriving bar and disco scene. At night, some streets, like the Rambla and Passeig de Gràcia, become slow-moving rivers of strollers. The main churches and monuments are illuminated, and the city takes on a new and graceful aspect.<n>The weekly cultural guide Guía del Ocio contains up-to-date information on all entertainment in Barcelona (available at newsstands, in Spanish), while Barcelona Olé!, a monthly guide put out by Barcelona Tourism, has information on big shows and performances.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt
The west-side Portal of the Passion and its towers have been under construction since 1952, with builders using plans by other architects emulating his style. The east façade shows best what Gaudí intended. Everything has significance and a name, and no space is left unfilled. The three doorways, with stonework dripping like stalactites, represent Faith, Hope, and Charity, and are loaded with sculptures depicting angel choirs and musicians, and Biblical episodes such as the birth and youth of Jesus, the Flight into Egypt, the Slaughter of the Innocents, the Tree of Calvary, and much, much more. The cathedral is intended to incorporate every aspect of creation and faith. Twelve towers, four at each portal, are to represent the Apostles; four higher ones, the Evangelists; a dome over the apse, the Virgin; and the central spire, the Savior. Both, an elevator and steps give access to a lookout from one of the east towers.<n>On the west side is a modern sculptural interpretation, much criticized, that has galvanized those who believed the temple should have been left as it was, unfinished, as a tribute to the great Gaudí. Nevertheless, onward it goes  — when it will be finished, nobody knows. For now and perhaps the generation to come, the great spires are marred by ever-present scaffolding and cranes.<n>A short walk diagonally from La Sagrada Familia is the astonishing Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, designed by Domènech i Montaner (architect of the Palau de la Música Catalana) and completed by his son. The complex of buildings — still a working hospital — is one of modernisme’s most underrated (and least known) achievements.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
Farther up Montjuïc, turn left where the Avinguda de l’Estadi (the Olympic Ring boulevard) becomes the Avinguda de Miramar, to see the simple and elegant Fundació Joan Miró. The museum was designed in 1975 by the architect Josep Lluís Sert to house a large collection of paintings, drawings, tapestries, and sculpture by the Catalan surrealist. Miró died in 1983 at the age of 90. The exhibits follow Miró’s artistic development from 1914 onwards. Photographs show him always neatly dressed and barbered, looking like a Catalan businessman in contrast to the more bohemian Picasso, and in contrast, too, with the surrealist works he created. The collection is witty and bright with the bright colors and unique language symbols associated with the artist.<n>The Avinguda de Miramar continues past the station of the funicular railway that climbs the hill from the Avinguda del Paral.lel near the Paral.lel metro stop. The funicular links up here with a cable car that goes to the Parc d’Atraccions de Montjuïc, an amusement park, and on to the Castell de Montjuïc on the summit. Cable cars run daily in summer, weekends-only in winter. A short walk from the amusement park is the Plaça de l’Armada station for the cable car that crosses the harbor, completing an interesting network of transport by cable.<n>The fortress atop Montjuïc, built in 1640, remained in use by the army and then as a prison until shortly before it was turned over to the city to become a museum in 1960. The Museu Militar (Military Museum) has an extensive collection of antique weaponry and armor, lead soldiers of different epochs, and models of Catalan castles. Here in a basement room you’ll find what may be the only statue of Generalíssimo Francisco Franco to be seen in Barcelona today. The fort has somber associations for the city: Its cannons bombarded the population to put down rebellions in the 18th and 19th centuries, and it was the site of political executions, including that of Lluís Companys, president of the Generalitat of Catalonia during the Civil War, who was shot by a firing squad in 1940.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
Other markets specialize in certain merchandise. The Chaowai Flea Market, north of Ritan Park, is known for its antiques, carvings, and furniture. The Scroll Market, in the Xicheng District inside the Second Ring Road North, sells handpainted scrolls, chops, and goldfish. A bit farther north from here, the Bird Market sells songbirds and ornate cages. The Sanlitun District has a large wicker and bamboo market, as well as a sportswear market, amidst its café and bar strip. The Hongqiao Market (also known as the Chongwenmen Market and the Farmers’ Market), on the northeast edge of the Temple of Heaven (Tiantan) Park, is the best place to shop for jewelry bargains, especially pearls.<n>The Panjiayuan Antique and Curio Market (variously known as the “Dirt Market,” “Ghost Market,” and “Sunday Market”) is the most interesting to browse in Beijing. Located well south of city center inside the Third Ring Road, it goes into full swing at sunrise every Sunday morning, when over 100,000 visitors sift through wares ranging from antiques and collectibles to ceramics and family heirlooms.<n>Entertainment<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhatToDo.txt
Across the street is the Carriage Museum. Until the 1940s, horses and carriages were the only modes of transportation permitted along the narrow Bermuda roads, and almost every well-to-do family had a horse-drawn vehicle. However, these disappeared almost immediately following a relaxation of the strict rules that had kept motor vehicles off the island. This collection of beautiful carriages celebrates those “gone-but-not-forgotten” days.<n>St. Peter’s Church sits on Duke of York Street, now the main route through the town. Originally built in 1612, it is the oldest Anglican church in the Western Hemisphere still regularly used for services; much of the present structure dates from 1713. The beautiful building is filled with Bermudian cedar for the roof supports and the pews. The font is even older than the church itself and was brought with the earliest settlers from a previous church in England. Pride of place goes to the collection of silver, the chalice, the chalice set, and the alms basin, all dating from the 17th century. The church has also kept old coins dating from 1616. Behind the south churchyard you can find the Old Rectory, built in the 18th century for pirate George Drew and kept in beautiful order by the Bermuda National Trust.<n>Take Duke of Kent Street north from the town center to reach a number of important attractions. Almost immediately on the left is St. George’s Historical Society Museum, set in an 18th-century house that was once home to the Mitchell family. Walk up the “welcome arms” staircase (a common feature of family homes of the era) and step into a treasure-trove of Bermudiana. Furniture, clothing, and works of art have all been donated or bought to add to the fascinating — and constantly growing — collection. Here is everything from buttons to bottles to old bathtubs. The kitchen at the back of the house is filled with authentic pieces: earthenware jars for storage, copper cups for measuring, iron pots for cooking. The admission price includes tea and Bermudian banana bread.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
Cape Ann<n>From Salem the coast road (Route 127) to Cape Ann goes through Manchester, which has the lovely, sandy Singing Beach. Just past Magnolia Hammond Castle Museum looms above the entrance to Gloucester Harbor. Inventor John Hays Hammond, Jr. built this medieval-style castle to house his early Roman, medieval, and Renaissance collections. It also contains an 8,200-pipe organ (concerts are given).<n>Gloucester (38 miles/61 km from Boston) is a gritty salty town, the country’s oldest fishing port and also the busiest on the Massachusetts coast. Rows of gulls perch on the ridges of the factory roofs that line the wooden quays and jetties, while a steady stream of fishing craft and whale-watch cruisers weigh and drop anchor. It’s also home to one of the most engaging small museums anywhere, the Cape Ann Historical Association. It shows the largest collection of paintings by native of Gloucester Fitz Hugh Lane (1804–1865) along with works by other artists who visited Cape Ann — Winslow Homer, Milton Avery, and others. It also has exhibits on the Gloucester fishing industry and the area’s granite quarrying industry.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
Early Settlers<n>The settlement of present-day Hungary goes far back in time. Less than 64 km (40 miles) to the west of Budapest, human traces thought to be half a million years old have been excavated and are now on display at the Hungarian National Museum. The ﬁrst tribes that came to this area brought skills and tools which improved the lot of the hunter, made farming feasible, and, in time, gave rise to primitive industries.<n>Around the third century b.c., Hungary was occupied by a Celtic-Illyrian tribe known as Eraviscans, refugees from wars in Greece. They established a tribal centre on top of Gellért Hill and continued the early settlers’ artistic and industrial innovations.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-History.txt
This is an old narrow-gauge line which traverses seemingly unspoiled forests — but for the numerous walking trails — and climbs, slowly, ever-upwards. At the ﬁrst stop, Normafa, you’ll find a ski-run, but unless it’s snowing stay on the train until János-hegy. It is a 10–15 minute walk from here to the János-hegy lookout tower, at 529 metres (1,735 feet) the highest point in the city. If the horizon is not blurred by mist, there’s a splendid 360-degree view for mile upon mile; you can also eat here.<n>On the way to the lookout tower you will have passed a chair-lift that goes down to a camping site. The views from the chair-lift are also spectacular, and the peace and quiet as you soar up and down the mountainside is quite extraordinary. Remember to note that the chairlift is closed on some Mondays — check with Tourinform, or go on another day. If you would prefer a speedy return to town, catch the 158 bus (to Moszkva tér) from near the bottom of the chair-lift.<n>Between the Banks<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
You can see Yosemite Creek drop down half a mile from the opposite wall in the spectacular Upper, Middle, and Lower Yosemite Falls, and you’ll get an outstanding view of the majestic Half Dome, a granite monolith sliced in two by the Ice Age glaciers. From here you may feel like leaving the bus and hiking back down to the valley, along the Panorama Trail via the Nevada and Vernal Falls, a trip of 8 miles (13 km), most of it downhill!<n>A beautiful and easy hike goes out to Mirror Meadow, tucked in underneath the vertical northwest face of Half Dome. The trail is especially good during early spring or summer mornings, when the waters are perfectly still, capturing the most breathtaking colors from the trees and the cliffs of Mount Watkins behind it.<n>Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
The Centre’s design, in a lovely green ravine of the Don River valley, makes an exciting first impression. Architect Raymond Moriyama has linked up the Centre’s several buildings with escalators and passageways like a series of atomic nuclei, comparable to his work on the various spaces and levels of the Metro Toronto Library.<n>Inside, it’s one thing to remember what your teacher told you about static electricity, and quite another to touch (without risk) the Centre’s 500,000-volt sphere and see your hair stand on end. You can man the controls of a space vehicle for a simulated moon-landing, broadcast your voice clear around the world through a parabolic sound reflector, or find out what goes on off-camera in a fully equipped TV studio.<n>The McMichael Canadian Collection (in the village of Kleinburg, 25 km/15 miles, 40 minutes’ drive, northwest of Toronto) consecrates the work of one of Canada’s best-known schools of painting, the Group of Seven. These artists of the first half of the 20th century sought the sources of their inspiration in a distinctly Canadian landscape rather than in the derivative themes of European painting. The museum has chosen an appropriate setting of evergreen forest overlooking the Humber valley for its location. The stone and log building is itself, in more solid form, a visual reference to the log cabins of the country’s earliest settlers. Look out, too, for the Inuit and Indian art, most notably the work of Norval Morrisseau, a Midéwiwin Indian from northern Ontario whose works explore traditional subjects with a modern abstract technique.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Switching its echoes from Westminster to Buckingham Palace, Parliament Hill provides pomp with a Changing of the Guard by 125 soldiers of the Governor General’s Foot Guards (June 23 to August 25, 2001 at 9:45 a.m). On summer evenings, a sound and light show illuminates the Parliament Buildings to present, alternately in English and French, a 30-minute history of Canada.<n>Sparks Street Mall, the first street in Ottawa to be paved and then the city’s, indeed the country’s, first traffic-free pedestrian zone, is a pleasant shopping area enlivened by street musicians and clowns and bordered by some first-class modern office buildings. Pride of place goes to the elegant 12-story mirror-glass Bank of Canada (between Kent and Bank Streets) by Arthur Erickson. The green patina of the building’s copper skeleton is an artful homage to the copper roofs on the old Parliament Buildings. Inside is the Currency Museum (see page 78). On the vast three-sided Confederation Square — popularly known for its traffic congestion as “Confusion Square” — notice the great granite arch of the National War Memorial, with its statues of 22 World War I soldiers and a horse-drawn cannon. Ironically, it was dedicated by George VI just three months before the outbreak of World War II. The square’s bunker-like National Arts Centre (1969) houses the capital’s ballet, opera, and theater, but it’s the summer beer-garden overlooking the Rideau Canal that is the most popular attraction. Getting a federal government’s priorities in proper perspective, one member of parliament bemoaned the cultural center as “50 years ahead of its time — that’s how long it’ll take the taxpayers to meet the 500 percent cost overrun.” The formidable Château Laurier, (1912) a railway hotel on the north side of the square, is built in the Renaissance castle style much favored by the C.P.R. and C.N.R. for their luxury transcontinental hostelries. Local citizens boast that the Rideau Canal, which stretches 200 km (120 miles) from the Ottawa River to Lake Ontario, qualifies in winter as “the world’s longest skating rink.” In summer, it offers delightful boat cruises and canoeing, or you can explore its banks with a rented bicycle.<n>On the edge of the parliamentary district, across the Rideau Canal, is Byward Market (one block east of Sussex Drive and north of Rideau Street). Since 1846, when it was a clearing house for nearby farmers, this has been the popular center of town, meeting place for the non-politicos. In its jolly, well-restored state, only one of the market stalls dates as far back as 1867, but the market retains much of its 19th-century atmosphere. Quite apart from the colorful stalls of fruit and vegetables, it’s a great place for breakfast, open even on Sundays in a town that otherwise closes down when the bureaucrats go home.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Entertainment<n>Once the sun goes down, Cancún gears up. There’s no shortage of places to go or things to do, and no need to take a long novel to fill those quiet moments — there just won’t be any. Many people don’t take to their beds until they’ve seen the sun come up. If you choose to stay in Mujeres or Cozumel, things will be a bit more laid back. The diving fraternity tends to enjoy low-key, less glamorous entertainment and relatively early nights before they head under the waves early the following day.<n>Before you head straight into the resort atmosphere of Cancún, check out what’s happening in your hotel. Many have “Las Vegas style” floor shows, Mexican evenings with traditional folk music and dances, and clubs where you can take to the dance floor yourself.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhatToDo.txt
South of the cruise port, the road (currently in the process of being upgraded) leads away from the urban development and out into the countryside. This part of the island has some of the best and most sheltered beaches. In recent years, a number of excellent resort hotels have been built on large plots of land; you will see their gated entrances as you drive by. Next to these are the more modest accommodations that for years have catered to dedicated divers.<n>Around 5 km (3 miles) from town you will find the entrance to Chankanaab State Park. This was one of the first sites on the island to offer organized reef snorkeling in an offshore lagoon, though as it became more popular it developed other attractions. Snorkeling is still extremely good offshore, though the lagoon site is now devoid of marine life and is used simply as a safe swimming area. Chankanaab offers a botanical garden and a sculpture park displaying native art from all areas of Mexico. It has a dive shop, beach umbrellas, sun beds, and two restaurants. Perhaps the prize of the park goes to the “Swim with the Dolphins” program. The dolphins are kept in open water just offshore and reached by a wooden walkway. Small groups of people can enter the water with the dolphins; an instructor controls the activities and exercises.<n>South from Chankanaab you can stop at a number of fine sandy beaches on the west coast. The major sites are Playa San Francisco, Playa del Sol, and Playa Palancar. All the main beaches have public access and each has its own café-bar, watersports facilities, and lockers for beachgoers. The water is a beautiful clear turquoise color; you will see small dive or snorkel boats bobbing offshore as you soak up the sun. These waters offer some of the best diving and snorkeling in the world. The variety of sea-life living on and around the coral reef here is amazing, with many of the largest migratory fish species paying a visit at different times of the year. In order to protect the delicate environment around the reef, the Cozumel Reefs National Park was created in July 1996, covering over 80% of the dive sites off the island in its 11,987 hectares (29,620 acres). There is a US$2 daily charge to dive in the park.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
Chongqing (Chungking)<n>Although the city’s history goes back thousands of years, Chongqing was never a cultural center, and it isn’t today. It cannot offer spectacular temples, palaces, or archaeological sites. Rather, it is a place to see the daily life of a major Chinese industrial city and to begin some outstanding excursions on the legendary Yangzi River.<n>In the Qin Dynasty, in the third century b.c., the city was the capital of the dreamily named Kingdom of Ba. Its present name (Chongqing means “Double Jubilation”) dates from the medieval period, commemorating a lucky streak in the life of the local prince. Until the last few years it was spelled Chungking, by which name the city was best known in the West as the political and military capital of the Nationalist government from 1939 to 1945, the wartime redoubt of Chiang Kai-shek.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Sights worth seeing in town include the Chongqing People’s Hall, built in 1953 to serve as a 4,000-seat conference hall and hotel. It blends the styles of the Ming and Qing dynasties with the needs of a modern conference hall. The Chongqing Museum, while poorly-lit and aging, does contain a collection of dinosaur eggs and two 3,000-year-old wooden boats that, suspended from the cliffs of the Yangzi, served as caskets for nobles in the days of the Ba Kingdom. Perhaps the liveliest sight in Chongqing is the 1,000-year-old Luohan Temple, where blind fortune-tellers and devoted followers of Buddha converge from dawn to dusk.<n>In the domain of darker political history, two former Nationalist prisons outside town are open as monuments to the Revolutionary cause. The US/Chiang Kai-shek Criminal Acts Exhibition Hall (so goes the catchy title) includes cells and torture chambers. Western visitors are not usually shown around unless they specifically request it. This is largely in deference to the sensitivities of Europeans and Americans, who are blamed for collusion with the Nationalists in the excesses of their anticommunist struggle.<n>Because of Chongqing’s notoriously torrid summer weather — it’s known as one of the “ovens” of China — hills and parks are a very welcome refuge here. Loquat Hill (Pipashan), the city’s highest spot, has gardens, a teahouse (Hongxing), and some splendid panoramas. The Northern and Southern Hot Springs parks (Beiwenquan and Nanwenquan) are also popular gathering places, with well-kept public gardens. A typical Chongqing method of escaping the heat is to take refuge in a cool cave. During the years of Japanese air raids, hundreds of air-raid shelters were dug into the mountains here, and some have been turned into cafés and restaurants.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Tourists are so numerous in the otherwise relaxed shopping district of Guilin that the pedestrian crossings have signs in English as well as Chinese. Another cosmopolitan influence comes from the area’s many minority peoples: Guilin is part of the Guangxi-Zhuang Autonomous Region, which borders Vietnam. The proliferation of so-called Muslim restaurants is explained by the presence here of thousands of people of the traditionally Muslim Zhuang nationality, China’s largest minority group.<n>The geological history of Guilin, the key to the wonder of its moody mountains and caves, goes back several hundred million years. The area was under the sea when an upheaval raised it to the status of terra firma. Later it was flooded, then lifted again in further cataclysmic events. The alternation of sea water and air through the millennia created limestone formations called karst, which eroded into pinnacles, mounds, and peaks that captivate the imagination.<n>Guilin was settled more than 2,000 years ago when the Ling canal was built, effectively linking the great Yangzi and Pearl rivers. Guilin’s connection with one of mankind’s most ambitious engineering projects was important, but otherwise little was heard from the town. It served as provincial capital for several hundred years, and in modern times, thanks to the profusion of caves to hide in, Guilin was a center for resistance during the war with Japan. Today, rebuilt from the rubble of war, the city is thriving, thanks in large measure to its spectacular scenery.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
To the south is a much larger village, Daxu, with a high bridge from the Ming period called “Longevity Bridge.” Here and elsewhere, the rich, flat land produces the ingredients for a formidable fruit salad: oranges and grapefruit, chestnuts and persimmons, plus exotic tropical delicacies all but unknown outside Asia. Adding to the entrancing beauty of the scene, great stands of a feathery variety of bamboo grow along the riverbanks, forming huge cascades of green.<n>Beyond the village of Yangdi unfolds the uncanny scenery that prompted a Chinese poet more than a thousand years ago to write: “The river is a green silk belt, the mountains emerald hairpins.” Peaks and pinnacles crowd the river, white goats pose on steep mountainsides, and an eagle soars above the cliffs. The river itself flows green and transparent. Credit for this limpid rarity goes not only to the strict antipollution standards to protect the River Li but also to nature itself, which endows the water with a high content of carbonic acid.<n>Mural Hill is so called because the sheer cliff face comprises so many patches of color that it might be a fresco. In the lights and shadows of the cliff, the shapes of nine different horses can be discerned, hence the cliff’s alternate name, “Nine Horse Hill.” Near the end of the voyage, the village of Xinping comes into view on the left bank, surrounded by magical scenery — landmarks with names like Snail Hill, Five Fingers Hill, and Carp Hill.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
At the moment of highest tension, the matador leans over the horns to thrust his sword deep into the bull’s aorta for the kill. Success means instant death. But the target, a tiny fist-sized area between the shoulders, can only be reached when the animal’s feet are together; and swift kills, which need strength as well as skill and nerve, don’t always happen.<n>If the fight has been good and the kill clean, the presidente will award the torero one or both of the bull’s ears and, for exceptional performances, the tail, too. An ear is usually the signal for a lap of honour, and, if the crowd agrees with the award, flowers and botas of wine shower into the ring. Very occasionally an exceptional performance by the bull earns him a reprieve for breeding. In this case, the presidente drops a green handkerchief and the crowd goes wild.<n>The corrida is not for everyone — not even for every Spaniard. But see at least one before you pass judgement on this extraordinary institution.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Perhaps the most illustrious resident of the neighborhood was Moses Maimónides. And a statue of the 12th-century doctor, philosopher, and theologian stands a few steps from the synagogue in the square named in his honor, Plaza de Maimónides. Also in the plaza is the Casa de las Bulas, which holds the interesting combination of a small market of Córdoban craftspeople selling silver filigree and tooled leather goods, and the Museo Taurino (Bullfighting Museum).<n>Northeast of the mosque on the Plaza Jerónimo Paéz, the splendid Renaissance Palacio Paéz houses the Museo Arqueológico Provincial. The exhibits span the centuries from the Iberian era to the Visigothic period, but pride of place goes to objects from the 10th-century palace of Medina Azahara, like the bronze figure of a stag taken from a fountain presented by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII.<n>A Christian king, Alfonso XI, built Córdoba’s Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos, overlooking the river to the southwest of the mosque. The ramparts offer a fine view over the old town and the river, the islets in midstream each occupied by a ruined Moorish mill, and the ridges of the Sierra de Córdoba low on the northern horizon. The Catholic Monarchs received Columbus and planned the invasion of Granada while residents here.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Zorba the Greek? Music and Dance<n>For many, the image of Greek music and dance is inexorably linked to the film “Zorba the Greek.” Anthony Quinn performs the syrtáki dance (in fact an amalgam of several different traditional dances), to the sound of the bouzoúki, a stringed guitar-type instrument that produces melodic, slightly metallic sounds. When played live it has a haunting melody, but taverna owners do have the irritating habit of playing it at high decibels through overloaded speakers. This does a great disservice to the Greek musical tradition, which is rich, varied and goes back for hundreds of years. The tradition is still particularly strong on Crete where traditional musicians and singers are held in high regard.<n>Musical rhythms were traditionally matched to the complex cadences of the epic poetry of Greece. These are very different from the ‘four beats to a bar’ that characterizes the western musical tradition, and therefore it is sometimes difficult for Western listeners to follow. Songs have traditionally been sung by men — relating the hard life of the farmer or fisherman and including an element of sentimentality rarely expressed in other areas of a Greek male’s life.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhatToDo.txt
Firá is beautiful but can get a little oppressive as visitors crowd the narrow streets. A little way north is another smaller town where the pace is a little less frantic. Iá (pronounced Oya), set on the northern cliffs, became home to a number of artists and still maintains a more bohemian atmosphere than Firá. There are many homes built into the hillsides and some have been converted into art galleries and ‘collectibles’ shops. Its typical Cycladic architecture and multicolored façades make it one of the most photographed villages in the world.<n>Aside from the stunning views, Santorini has many more delights to show its visitors, with 12 villages to visit set among agricultural land. The fertile volcanic soil is blanketed in vines — over 100,000 bottles of wine are produced here every year — or in plants producing tiny sweet tomatoes, a speciality here. In the center of the island is the village of Pirgos with the remains of a Venetian fortress at its heart. On a rocky bluff beyond the village you will find the 17th-century Monastery of Profítis Ilías. The monastery is only open when the priests inside take liturgies — mornings or early evenings — but it is well worth taking the time to visit. Pride of place goes to a 15-century icon of the prophet Elijah. It also has a museum, which conveys a flavor of monastic life, along with icons and manuscripts. Unfortunately the hilltop is also shared with the Greek military and it bristles with satellite and digital technology, prohibiting photography of the beautiful panorama. On the east coast are beaches of fine black or red sand — another legacy of the volcanic activity — which heat to a ferocious temperature in the summer sun.<n>In the south of the island is one of the most important ancient sites in the Mediterranean. Near the modern village of Akrotíri, a complete city was discovered dating from before 2000 b.c. It was totally covered by several feet of ash during the eruption around 1500 b.c., but unlike the tragic city of Pompeii in Italy, no human remains have been found, leading scientists to believe that the population escaped before the disaster took place. Since 1967 the site has been painstakingly excavated to give a picture of daily life before the great eruption. A society of complexity and sophistication is being unveiled, including organized urban planning, heating, sanitation, and a standard script. However, much of the beautiful artwork found here is, for the moment, in the Archaeological Museum in Athens. The remains, which include streets with houses and pretty communal squares, have been placed under a protective corrugated roof that gets hot and crowded, so try to visit as early in the day as possible.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Not far from the museum is one of Santiago’s best places to get sweaty in the evening. The Casa de las Tradiciones, a “cultural center” in a sweet little pink house (Calle General Lacret, 651), has live music and as much dancing as its tiny space will allow. It’s great fun, and the locals usually outnumber the tourists.<n>Just west of the Padre Pico steps (south of the train station) is the one-room César Escalante cigar factory, unimpressive by comparison with other Cuban cigar factories but still an enjoyable place to visit, and the Ron Caney rum factory. The oldest rum distillery in the country, it was established in 1838 by Don Facundo Bacardí (whose descendants fled the country in 1959) and nationalized the following year. The rum produced here now goes under the name “Havana Club.” You can visit only a small museum and bar.<n>Around Santiago<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
North of Moncada, beyond the bus station, is the Plaza de la Revolución, a frighteningly polluted open square at the corner of Av. las Américas and Av. de los Libertadores. Massive spears thrust toward the sky in this monument to Antonio Maceo, a hero of the war of independence, who is seen riding triumphantly.<n>The fine Cementerio Santa Ifigenia, just north of the harbor (Av. Crombel and Reparto Juan Gómez), is the resting place of many Cuban heroes. Pride of place goes to the Cuban founding father José Martí, in a vast octagonal mausoleum designed so that the tomb catches the sun throughout the day. Look also for the tombs of Céspedes and Frank País; Frank’s (as santiagueros refer to him) is marked like many others with the Cuban flag and the flag of the 26 July movement.<n>In an impressive setting 7 km (4 miles) from the city is the 17th century El Morro Castle, surveying the harbor mouth from a commanding clifftop position. Moated, thickly walled, and full of cannons, drawbridges, and passageways, it is in excellent condition. One room houses displays on pirates through the ages. A guide will point out a torture room with a trap door in the floor, through which uncooperative prisoners and slaves were reportedly dropped to the sea below. That’s not a terribly appetizing thought, but the restaurant just beyond the castle, also called “El Morro,” has gorgeous views of the sea and some of Santiago’s finest food; it’s a great place to get out of the intense sun. The easiest way to get to El Morro is to hire a taxi, which costs about US$15 roundtrip (the driver will wait for up to a couple hours while you explore the castle and even eat lunch).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
A typical day on an organized camping trek begins around 6am with a mug of tea outside your tent as the first rays of sun hit the high peaks above you. Breakfast might be a bowl of porridge or toast and eggs. After a bit of a wash-up from a basin of warm water, you’ll be on the trail by 7am. No need to worry about packing up the tent or cleaning the breakfast dishes: that’s what you’ve hired the porters to do.<n>Porters stop for their first real meal of the day — rice and lentils — between 10 and 11am, and consequently, trekkers can also expect to eat lunch fairly early, usually on the edge of a village or at a scenic vista. After a bit of exploration in the area, there will be a few more hours of hiking before calling it quits for the day around 3pm, once again usually in an interesting village. The porters will then busy themselves with setting up camp, usually in a designated campground, and preparing the evening meal. The sun often goes behind the mountains early, and supper always follows soon after sunset, usually around 6pm. With only kerosene lamps to keep away the dark, exhausted trekkers usually head for bed by 9pm.<n>For trekkers doing a lodge-to-lodge trek, the day’s schedule is slightly different. There is usually no “bed tea,” but there might be a wide range of choices for breakfast (many lodges now have electric ovens, and fresh baked breads and rolls are all the rage).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
Some Popular Treks<n>Solu-Khumbu: the Everest region (5 days–3 weeks). The shortest possible trek for a close view of Mount Everest and Sherpa country in Sagarmatha National Park is a five-day dash with round-trip flights between Kathmandu and Lukla. The trail goes up the Dudh Kosi river valley through lovely woodlands with an overnight at Phakding or Jorsale. The next night is at Namche Bazaar, where there is a Sherpa market on Saturdays. Return is by the same route with an added night at Lukla to be on hand for one of the (often cancelled) early morning flights back.<n>Add two days for the interesting switchback walk from Namche to the Thyangboche Monastery and back, or ten days for the circuit that goes on to Pheriche, Lobuje, Gorak Shep, and Kala Patar for one of the greatest of all Himalayan views. It is also possible to continue on to the Everest Base Camp area at an exhausting 5,360 m (17,586 ft), although there is not much to see at base camp (no view of Everest). Add another week (for a total of 20 to 21 days) if you hike in from Jiri (reachable from Kathmandu by bus or taxi) and then fly out of Lukla. Add yet another 5 days if you walk back out to Jiri.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt

This route provides superb views of Macchapuchhare, the spectacular Fishtail Peak. Continue to Ghorapani, which sits high above the valley of the Kali Gandaki River. Separating Dhaulagiri and Annapurna 1, the Kali Gandaki forms the world’s deepest valley. Return to Pokhara in five to six days via Poon Hill and Birethanti. Or add ten days round-trip and continue from Ghorapani to Tatopani and Muktinath through Thakali villages along the old salt-trade route to Tibet.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
KathmanduValley<n>Just minutes away from the heart of Kathmandu, life goes on as it has for centuries in the rural communities of the valley. Most of the network of driveable roads is less than 40 years old. Before that there were few cars in Nepal. In the valley, at least the main street of principal villages is paved and accessible by taxi and bus, though the slower pace of walking or cycling is the most pleasant way to enter this world where time seems to have stopped.<n>Farmland begins at the very edge of the cities, and the fields are full of activity whatever the season. Rice needs lots of water, so the paddy (the shoots are grown from seed) is transplanted when the June rains flood the fields. This is a job for the women, who work in lines to space the young plants in neat rows. In summer the rice forms a green velvety blanket, then turns golden in autumn when it ripens and is harvested. This brings out the whole valley in force, everyone bending low with small sickles to cut the stalks, then stacking these in sheaves for fuel or thatch after the rice is threshed. Then the grain is dried in the sun, covering the squares and streets of villages, and is winnowed by tossing it in the air from round trays. Fields of yellow mustard are grown for oil-seed. Wheat is planted as a winter crop in the paddies, and garden plots supply maize, chilies, and vegetables.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
Travel by road provides a glimpse of the Terai, an extension of the Ganges Plain. This well-watered farming zone stretches the length of the country on its southern border with India. It’s only about 40 km (25 miles) wide, but a third of Nepal’s population lives here, producing much of the nation’s food.<n>A visit to Lumbini, birthplace of Gautama Buddha, can also be made in about three hours from Chitwan. (There are also flights from Kathmandu to Bhairawa, the nearest airfield, with a bus service to Lumbini.) The story goes that Buddha’s mother gave birth to him under a tree in a garden at Lumbini, unable to get back in time to the palace, some 20 km (12 miles) away. Marking the spot is a pillar commemorating the visit in 250 b.c. of the Indian emperor Ashoka, a zealous convert to Buddhism. Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world come to Lumbini, and in recent years the site has been developed into an international cultural and religious park with several hotels and numerous Buddhist temples built by the world’s various Buddhist countries.<n>Although few tourists stray from the Kathmandu-Pokhara-Chitwan focal points, it is possible to see something of the undeveloped west without walking three weeks to get there. There are now several lodges at Royal Bardia National Park on the Karnali River. This park was created specifically as a preserve for tigers, which, with a little luck, can be seen here more easily than at Chitwan National Park. Elephant rides, jungle walks and drives, river rafting, and bird-watching keep visitors busy. The Karnali gorge above Chisopani is especially beautiful and is noted for the size of the fighting mahseer carp taken by sport fishermen.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
Municipal pools are available for swimming. The most serious action takes place at the Olympic-size indoor pools in the Centre de Natation, at 34 boulevard Carnot, and the Forum des Halles shopping complex.<n>Among spectator sports, pride of place goes to horse-racing. The summer meetings at Longchamp (venue of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe), Auteuil, and Chantilly are as elegant as Britain’s Ascot. The serious punter who wants to avoid the frills and Champagne can have a very good time at Vincennes and Enghien trotting races.<n>Rugby and football (soccer) can be seen at the spectacular new Stade de France on the northern outskirts at St-Denis or at Parc-des-Princes at the south end of the Bois de Boulogne. Nearby, tennis tournaments are held at Roland-Garros, or indoors over at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, near the Gare de Lyon. Paris-Bercy is also the venue for everything from rock concerts to tango competitions, as well as cycle races and indoor windsurfing.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhatToDo.txt
Estoril Coast<n>The Costa do Estoril (formerly called the Costa do Sol) begins just west of Lisbon and goes all the way around the tip of the peninsula to Guincho on the open Atlantic. Those seeking pollution-free swimming (see page 132) usually head for Guincho, but the famous old resort of Estoril itself, some 24 km (15 miles) from Lisbon, is still worth a visit. The beaches and resorts west of Lisbon are all accessible by train from the capital’s Cais do Sodré station.<n>While Estoril is a full-scale resort — cosmopolitan and sybaritic — Cascais, which sits on a pretty curved bay, leads a double life, as a town of fishermen and kings, where the humble and the retiring rich coexist with camera-toting tourists.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
Attractive Amarante sits on a gorge of the Tâmega (a tributary of the Douro) and makes a good stop if you are driving along the road from Porto towards Mesã Frio and Régua. Baronial mansions with gaily painted balconies overlooking the river line the streets. Rising above a handsome stone arched bridge and leafy park, the church of the former 16th-century monastery of São Gonçalo is well worth a visit, especially if you are looking for love: It hosts a pilgrimage in June for women seeking husbands (with the exchange of phallic-shaped cakes—a remarkably literal step in the mating dance).<n>The river bends and twists, widens and narrows among green terraced hills. The port trade prompted the growth of Peso da Régua (usually called just Régua), 70 km (43 miles) east of Porto. Régua was once the main port used to ship young wines downriver in barcos rabelos (flat-bottomed wooden boats) to Vila Nova de Gaia. Though the railways took over for transport from Pinhão (at the confluence of the Douro and Pinhão rivers), and today the wine goes mostly by road, Régua remains an important transportation and commercial hub.<n>What the town lacks in beauty it makes up for in industry. The headquarters of port winemakers, Casa do Douro, remains in Régua (visitors can pick up a map of the Port Wine Route there). Sandeman operates a large modern winery just across the river, and Cockburns is up the hill overlooking Régua.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
The Sotavento Coast<n>Heading east from the provincial capital of Faro, the first settlement of any size you will come to is the colorful fishing town of Olhão. Olhão used to be described as the “little white Cubist town of the Algarve,” its architecture likened to that of North African towns. The parish church (which also goes by the name of Nossa Senhora do Rosário) was founded by King Dom Pedro II in 1698. The small chapel at the rear, Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos (Our Lady of the Afflicted), is where women often pray when their fishermen husbands are away at sea.<n>Instead of the red-tiled roofs and filigreed chimneys seen elsewhere in the Algarve, the Olhão skyline comprises flat-topped roofs of terraces called açoeitas. The Olhão fish market is one of the Algarve’s best, especially famous for its mussels and other shellfish.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
Northern Beaches and Towns<n>Further north beyond Nuevo Vallarta are a succession of small towns and relatively undeveloped beaches, in easy reach by car. Just a few kilometers to the east, traditional Mexican farming life goes its unhurried way up steep mountain roads where views can be superb and well worth the extra drive. The simple and the sensational seem to coexist so easily here.<n>Bucerías is a breezy beach community known for its fresh oysters and the palapa restaurants on its wide, white-sand beach. Independent small hotels and rental homes provide overnight accommodations.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt
