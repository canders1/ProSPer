rk, attributes the growth of inequality to the following: technological change (45 percent), international trade (12 percent), a decline in the real minimum wage (10 percent), rising immigration (8 percent), and other factors (15 percent).5 [SEP] Although such analysis and policy discussions have not singled out specific industries, the nature of the occupational structure and workforce in textiles and apparel—particularly the latter sector—makes the general discussion relevant to these two industries. [SEP] It would appear that neither the market imports of textiles nor the immigration of low-skilled workers has had an appreciable negative impact on the wages of the textile industry or its major sectors. [SEP] The average hourly earnings of U.S. employees in textile mill products (SIC 22)	went	from $4.66 in 1979 to $10.02 in 1997—an increase of 115 percent and more than the increase in all manufacturing or nondurable manufacturing. [SEP] This relative wage increase in textiles took place despite its concentration in a low-wage region—the southeastern Piedmont states—the low level of collective bargaining, and the higher-than-average percentage of women workers. [SEP] But the experience in apparel is less categorical, especially because of the differential impact on various branches of apparel and other textile products (SIC 23). [SEP] In 1997, the average hourly earnings of apparel workers were $8.25. [SEP] On the high end, automotive and apparel trimmings (SIC 2396) averaged $11.36; on the low end, women’s and misses’ blouses and skirts (SIC 2331) averaged $7.01.

A Dying Industry—or Not? [SEP] For many commentators, a book about the future of the U.S. apparel and textile industries is still an oxymoron. [SEP] The conventional wisdom paints a grim picture of where these industries are headed. [SEP] Low-cost labor overseas and the increasing penetration of imports have certainly undercut American apparel manufacturers; apparel imports grew rapidly in most categories starting in the mid-1970s. [SEP] If we measure import penetration in physical units (rather than dollar value),12 import penetration for men’s and boys’ suits, for example,	went	from just 10 percent in 1973 to 43 percent by 1996. [SEP] A similar expansion in imports occurred for men’s and boys’ trousers, women’s and girls’ dresses, and women’s slacks and shorts.13 [SEP] As one consequence, the number of business failures among U.S. apparel manufacturers climbed from 227 in 1975 to a high of 567 in 1993.14 Not surprisingly, employment in the apparel sector during this period declined appreciably. [SEP] And the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a further reduction in the domestic apparel industry during the period 1996 to 2006 from 864,000 workers to just 714,00015—this from an industry that employed about 1.2 million employees in 1950 and reached a peak of 1.4 million employees in 1973.16	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
he norm in traditional textiles, in the early 1950s leaders like Burlington Industries and Milliken undertook vertical integration to handle textile products from fiber to finishing.36 [SEP] Historically, finishing operations were often undertaken by separate firms known as converters, which played a large role in the design of finished goods. [SEP] Companies like Burlington integrated forward by bringing converting operations in-house, while a number of converters extended their operations backward into primary textiles. [SEP] Beyond restructuring for materials flow, the industry has experienced substantial horizontal integration. [SEP] As a consequence, some segments of textiles, such as spinning, weaving, and knitting, became more concentrated by the late 1970s. [SEP] The industry under	went	another substantial restructuring in the 1980s, and product lines became even more concentrated.37 [SEP] Much of this happened because less efficient firms, using older technologies,	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
The late Joseph Gerber, founder of Gerber Garment Technology Company in Tolland, Connecticut, invented automated fabric cutting and introduced it to the market in 1969. [SEP] This innovative company	went	on to create a new industry in automatic-cutting equipment. [SEP] By the late 1970s, Gerber Garment Technology was supplying the automotive and apparel industries with its GERBERcutter, allowing firms to cut cloth and nonwoven material more effectively. [SEP] The Gerber system first made it possible for a computer to guide the cutting knife anywhere on the cutting table. [SEP] Gerber’s automatic-cutting equipment, as well as that of several other international competitors, has continued to improve; cloth from a single ply to layers up to six inches thick can now be cut quickly and accurately. [SEP] Gerber is also a major worldwide supplier of information systems for the sewing products industries.

ns or small elements of existing garments—say, the trim or the fabric—and is more a matter of technical creation than a flight of fancy. [SEP] Consider the expansion of basic and fashion-basic garments in the U.S. market. [SEP] For T-shirts, sweatpants, and different types of jeans, the design elements that change annually may only amount to a change of color, fit of the jeans, or the addition of a pocket to sweatpants. [SEP] Traditionally, a new apparel design was created by asking the designer/artist to make a watercolor sketch. [SEP] If the fabric was to have a pattern, there might also be a close-up colored sketch of it. [SEP] Many designs would be grouped together into a storyboard, which was then presented to managers for final decisions. [SEP] Next the designs that passed this stage	went	through a technical design step in which details were added and patterns made. [SEP] After this step, fabric might be cut and a sample made to see how it would look on a mannequin. [SEP] If the new garment was a blouse, for example, the designer might wish to see how it looked with skirts planned for the collection. [SEP] If the designer was not satisfied with the drape of the garment, the fit, or the pattern, he or she might go back to square one. [SEP] Several iterations of these initial design steps could add weeks or months to the process before production began. [SEP] Although some haute couture or high-end apparel designers may still work in this manner, each year more garments are designed using computer technology.

 and sensitivity did not result in more competent children.8 [SEP] Instead, positive, supportive parenting that endured, even when it marked a change from an early period of parental retreat or negative interaction, was linked to favorable child development, including persistence in problem solving, high self-esteem, socially skilled behavior, closer friendships, and better peer relationships.9 [SEP] In sum, high-quality involvement with children requires a certain quantity of time—actually, a great deal, as I’ll argue in this book. [SEP] In Angela and Tom’s case, sandwiching concentrated time with Victor and Jeannine between work and other obligations, which often took precedence over family rituals, meant that routines that signal parental caring and that are major sources of development	went	by the wayside. [SEP] For example, family dinnertimes and storybook reading at bedtime became rare events. [SEP] So did the sheer enjoyment that comes from relaxed parent–child play; a joint cooking, art, or construction project; and a conversation based on real listening and exchange of ideas. [SEP] Because these experiences were so few and short-lived, Angela and Tom were deprived of valuable opportunities to observe their children closely and to become intimately familiar with their talents, shortcomings, preferences, styles of learning, and ways of coping with hardship—knowledge that is crucial for helping children develop into mature, competent individuals.

EP] They might, for example, run across Arnold Gesell’s books of the 1940s and 1950s—The Infant and Child in the Culture of Today, The First Five Years of Life, and The Child from Five to Ten38—still prominent in many bookstores. [SEP] Oering a lock-step description of physical, intellectual, and emotional milestones at each age, Gesell aimed to reassure uneasy parents that children’s problematic behaviors were merely a phase—part of a biologically based sequence requiring understanding, not correction. [SEP] A search of the previous generation’s parenting handbooks might uncover other volumes of this child-centered wave, including In Defense of Children, Children Have Their Reasons, and even Stop Annoying Your Children and Parents, Behave! [SEP] Experts of Gesell’s time complained that he	went	too far in downplaying the role of parents. [SEP] His advice was soon overshadowed by Benjamin Spock’s standby, Baby and Child Care, published in 1946 and selling millions of copies over seven editions, the most recent appearing in 1998.39 Providing answers to virtually any question about child rearing that might occur to a parent, from physical care to emotional, disciplinary, and educational issues, Spock seemed, on many fronts, to lean toward parental ﬁrmness and away from children’s rule-of-the-roost. [SEP] A closer look, however, indicates that even Spock felt torn between the embattled forces of adult and child control.

everyday routines and duties.   [SEP] By participating in everyday routines and duties at home and in preschool, children develop a sense of responsible participation in family and community life. [SEP] At the same time, they acquire practical skills and a wealth of knowledge about their physical and social surroundings. [SEP] The parent always in a hurry—who says, when the child desires involvement, “There isn’t time,” or who fails to insist that the child join in household tasks in keeping with his or her capacity—severely limits the child’s learning. [SEP] In preindustrial times, children spent most of their day alongside parents as they	went	about housekeeping and earning a livelihood. [SEP] As a result, children became deeply familiar with adults’ daily activities, picking up many skills through observation and direct participation. [SEP] (Recall John Ise’s account of family life on a rural Kansas homestead, described in Chapter 1.) [SEP] Greater parent–child togetherness throughout the day is also common in tribal and village societies, where adults spend less time supporting children’s learning through verbal scaolding because children have so many opportunities to observe and participate directly in the work of adults.98 [SEP] Because ﬁne-tuned scaolding is seldom required, adult–child participation in everyday routines and duties—preparing a meal, washing dishes, raking and bagging leaves in the garden, buying groceries—oe	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3

d defuse Sylvia’s envy with a game in which Sylvia spread out the newspaper before her, picked out all the capital letters on the page, and pretended, in a very grown-up way, to read—an achievement that attracted much parental admiration. [SEP] Sylvia’s mother often made up bedtime tales, serialized from one evening to the next. [SEP] Almost as soon as they could talk, Sylvia and her brother responded in kind with limericks, poems, and fantastic stories of their own. [SEP] On walks to their grandparents’ house and on long car trips, favorite books invariably came along, offering ready inspiration for the children’s imaginative creations.54 [SEP] Filmstar Charlie Chaplin’s mother was herself a talented comedy actress and singer. [SEP] As a young child, Charlie often accompanied her when she	went	to work at the theater. [SEP] As a result, playacting and impersonating became an early focus of Charlie’s pretending. [SEP] One evening during a performance, his mother’s voice failed. [SEP] In a pinch, the stage manager, who had seen Charlie at play, led the little boy onstage in her place. [SEP] Charlie continued his playacting unabated, which included songs, dances, and impersonations from his mother’s repertoire. [SEP] He was demonstrating the wares of his ﬁrst and best teacher in the art of make-believe, and the performance evoked a roar of appreciation and a shower of coins from the crowd.55 [SEP] In these and many other similar biographical anecdotes, childhood make-believe engendered imaginativeness that was clearly related to outstanding accomplishment in adulthood.

 grade. [SEP] No difference exists between younger and older classmates in achievement test scores.45 [SEP] A related dilemma involves whether to retain a kindergartner for a second kindergarten year if he or she is not progressing well. [SEP] More than a half-century of research has failed to show any learning beneﬁts for children retained in grade, and mounting evidence indicates that retention can be harmful, prompting negative attitudes toward school and a drop in self-esteem and in academic motivation, even as early as kindergarten.46 [SEP] In one study, retained kindergarten children, despite the extra year of school, scored lower than their classmates in academic achievement after entering the primary grades. [SEP] In contrast, children recommended for retention but who nevertheless	went	on to ﬁrst grade were doing just as well as classmates who had been promoted in the standard fashion.47 [SEP] Yet another alternative is to place a poorly performing kindergarten child in a “transition” class—a waystation between kindergarten and ﬁrst grade. [SEP] Transition classes, however, are a form of homogeneous grouping that gathers children judged by the school system as less likely to succeed. [SEP] As with other “low-ability” groups, teachers often have lower expectations for transition-class students and teach them in a less stimulating fashion than they do other children.48	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] The film is about the life of the Chicano singer Ritchie Valens, who recorded the song and made it very popular in 1958. [SEP] The song actually goes back to early Mexican colonial history; it has been traced to 1790 when it was performed at the Coliseo Theatre in Mexico City. [SEP] There are printed sources that cite the song being sung and danced in Veracruz during the nineteenth and early t	went	ieth centuries. [SEP] By the 1830s it was also a popular dance in Mexican California. [SEP] “La Bamba” is considered to be a son jarocho (country folks’ dancing music), an example of the mestizo (mixed-race) musical tradition, with strong African influences, from the state of Veracruz. [SEP] The instrumentation of the traditional son jarocho included a small harp, a small eight-string guitar (jarana), and a small four-string guitar (requinto).

[SEP] Even adults who’ve heard the story many times and do not want to admit belief still fear a late-night encounter with La Llorona. [SEP] There are ancient texts of indigenous mythology narrated by the Aztecs and recorded by the Spaniards that very closely resemble the La Llorona legend. [SEP] In some tales she is believed to be Cihuacoatl, the patron goddess of women who die in childbirth. [SEP] It is said that Cihuacoatl carried a little baby cradle on her back, or a dead baby in her arms, as she roamed the country crying through the nights. [SEP] Those who saw her considered it an ill omen. [SEP] Sahagún mentions in The Conquest of Mexico that “a woman was often heard [as] she	went	weeping and crying out. Loudly did she call out at night. She walked about saying: ‘O my beloved sons, now we are about to go!’” (Horcasitas and Butterworth, 208). [SEP] Horcasitas and Butterworth reprint several texts of these early chronicles. [SEP] Diego Muñoz Camargo (ca. 1529–1599) also reported that before the Spaniards arrived, “many times and many nights was heard the voice of a woman who cried out in a loud voice, drowning herself with her tears, and with great sobs and sighs, wailing” (Horcasitas and Butterworth, 209). [SEP] Contemporary texts of La Llorona collected in Mexico assert that the original Llorona was La Malinche, the mistress of Cortés. [SEP] Cortés abandoned her to return to Spain, and according to the legend Malinche killed their son with a knife.

[SEP] Her influence in the conquest of Mexico may be debatable, but there is no doubt that she is considered a heroine, almost on the same plane as La Virgen de Guadalupe. [SEP] Octavio Paz writes of La Malinche as the “violated woman,” La Chingada, and his writings have influenced several generations of Mexicanos and Chicanos in seeing the Mexican people as “hijos de la chingada,” that is, “sons of a conquest by rape.” [SEP] Cortés married Doña Marina off to one of his lieutenants, Juan Jaramillo, and they had one daughter.

nts.13 [SEP] The key provisions of these amendments define political membership, articulate basic rights, and provide an ambit of legislative competence. [SEP] So reformed, the American system of government would be able to protect individual rights as well as promote the equality of all persons who survived the war. [SEP] Of course, we must assume a set of institutions—a Congress, an Executive, and a Judiciary—that will continue to function according to the terms of their initial creation. [SEP] Still, there is something missing in this filtering off of the three Reconstruction Amendments and calling them a separate constitution. [SEP] The missing factor is the consciousness of setting forth a new framework of government, a structure based on values fundamentally different from those that	went	before. [SEP] To find that consciousness, we need to turn, I wish to argue, to the critical message of the Civil War, the address that would generate a new normative world in which to make sense of the epic war that consumed America from the firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox. [SEP] The new Nomos, the new framework of values that necessitated a new constitution, comes forth in one of the great prayers of the American civil religion, the Gettysburg Address. [SEP] It is worth recalling some of the enduring phrases of this civil prayer, the incantations that reverberated in American consciousness: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation [SEP] . . . .	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
The historical retreat to the Declaration of Independence left Lincoln with a major paradox.

[SEP] Yet, he thought himself back prior to the Philadelphia convention and the creation of the presidency. [SEP] He pulled the rug of legitimacy out from under his own office. [SEP] To be able to advocate the principle that all men are created equal, that a nation was born committed to this principle, he had to speak from a time prior to the creation of the government for which the Union troops died.

tribution of small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events. [SEP] As we shall see, the best data now suggest that precisely such a power law distribution of extinction and speciation events has occurred over the past 650 million years of the Phanerozoic. [SEP] In addition, the same body of theory predicts that most species go extinct soon after their formation, while some live a long time. [SEP] The predicted species lifetime distribution is a power law. [SEP] So too are the data. [SEP] Similar phenomena may occur in an econosphere. [SEP] Small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events occur in our technologies. [SEP] A colleague, Brian Arthur, is fond of pointing out that when the car came in, the horse, buggy, buggy whip, saddlery, smithy, and Pony Express	went	out of business. [SEP] The car paved the way for an oil and gas industry, paved roads, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. [SEP] The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote about this kind of turbulence in capitalist economies. [SEP] These Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction appear to occur in small and large avalanches. [SEP] Perhaps the avalanches arise in power laws.

 Wittgenstein invented the concept of a “language game,” a codefined cluster of concepts that carve up the world in some new way. [SEP] Consider, he said, legal language, and try translating it to ordinary statements about human agents without using legal concepts. [SEP] So consider, “The jury found Henderson guilty of murder.” [SEP] We understand this statement but do so in the context of law, evidence, legal responsibility, trials, guilt and innocence, jury systems, bribing jury members, appeal processes, and so forth. [SEP] Now try to translate the statement into a set of statements about ordinary human actions, “A group of twelve people were seated behind a wooden enclosure for several days. People talked about someone having died of poison. One day, the twelve people left the room and	went	to another room and talked about what had happened. Then the twelve people came back and one man stood up and uttered the words, ‘We find Henderson guilty of murder.’” There is no finitely prespecifiable list of statements about ordinary human actions whose truth would be necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement that the jury found Henderson guilty of murder.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
acent possible. [SEP] The secular diversity of organic molecular species has increased, on average, over the past . [SEP] billion years. [SEP] It is more than slightly interesting that this fact is clearly true, that it is rarely remarked upon, and that we have no particular theory for this expansion. [SEP] Indeed, I note for future reference that the standing diversity of species in the biosphere has, on average, with noticeable crashes in large extinction events, increased over the past . [SEP] billion years. [SEP] And among us mere humans, the diversity of ways of making a living has increased dramatically over the past million years, the past hundred thousand years, and even over the past thousand years. [SEP] If you wanted a rabbit for dinner thirty thousand years ago, you bloody well	went	out and caught a rabbit. [SEP] Now most of us can go buy a rabbit dinner. [SEP] Something again has happened. [SEP] At the level of species and ways of making a living in the “econosphere,” the actual has expanded into a persistent adjacent possible. [SEP] We are all parts of the universe. [SEP] So, in our little hunk of the universe, with the sun shining beatifically upon us, rather remarkable goings on have occurred.

[SEP] In disjunctive form, the requirements for species S to survive are (S v S v S) and (not S). [SEP] Bruce and Tim did numerical experiments for dierent values of S and K and C where again K is the number of alternative species any given species could eat. [SEP] (S v S v S) corresponds to K = .They found the same phase transition. [SEP] As more and more species are added, there are more potential interactions among the species since the pairwise possibilities increase as the square of the total species diversity. [SEP] As this occurs, each species appears in an increasing number of clauses, so as C/V increases, at some point the satisfiability of the Ksat system	went	from easy to hard. [SEP] It became hard, then impossible, to add new species. [SEP] The community filled up because the Ksat problem	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
ixed microbial communities hover on the subcritical-supracritical boundary? [SEP] We have seen other reasons that bound a community’s complexity, including Ksat problems noted in this chapter. [SEP] So a better question is: Can microbial communities be driven supracritical? [SEP] And if so, are they often near that boundary? [SEP] Of course, I do not know, but the hypothesis is testable. [SEP] Increase the diversity of species and test for the diversity of synthesized small molecules, say, by gas chromatography. [SEP] A colleague and I once devised such an experiment with mixtures of increasingly diverse moss species, planning to measure the molecular diversity of gas species evolved as a function of community diversity and the diversity in gas species introduced to the community. [SEP] We	went	skiing instead. [SEP] I still like the lines of the experiment. [SEP] It could be carried out directly with mixed microbial communities as well. [SEP] As noted in the previous chapter, there must be some interplay in the entry into the adjacent possible that gates the exploration by the capacity of natural selection to trim away the losers. [SEP] I described the Manfred Eigen–Peter Schuster error catastrophe. [SEP] If the mutation rate in a population of viruses is low, by successive rare successful mutations the population climbs steadily uphill, then becomes trapped on or in the near vicinity of a local peak.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
inction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. [SEP] In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. [SEP] We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. [SEP] We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. [SEP] And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera. [SEP] But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. [SEP] Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. [SEP] With the horse	went	the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. [SEP] With the car came paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. [SEP] The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. [SEP] One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. [SEP] More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? [SEP] Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. [SEP] Most firms die young, some last a long time. [SEP] We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions.

[SEP] I thought Origins and At Home were largely about the challenge of extending Darwinism to an account of evolution that embraced both self-organization and natural selection in some new, still poorly understood marriage.

d ornaments worn by men and women. [SEP] The ancient Greeks incorporated elements of dress in temple architecture. [SEP] This is most apparent in colonnades, which Vincent Scully has likened to hoplites massed in a phalanx.2 [SEP] There is no doubt that Classical columns were given human attributes. [SEP] Ancient authors likened the vertical flutes to the folds in a chiton, or tunic.3 [SEP] Columns have capitals—that is, heads. [SEP] The moldings of Doric capitals were sometimes painted to resemble headbands; Ionic and Corinthian capitals incorporated carved head garlands, and the curving tendrils of Corinthian capitals often look more like hair than foliage. [SEP] Indeed, Vitruvius considered the Corinthian order “feminine,” as opposed to the sturdy masculine Doric. [SEP] Sir Henry Wotton	went	so far as to call the Corinthian order “lascivious” and “decked like a wanton courtesan.”4 The second connection between dress and décor is social. [SEP] In the 1890s, the famous English economist Alfred Marshall observed that as people earned more money, they wanted better food, better clothes and larger homes—both for social standing and comfort.

[SEP] If family coats of arms are displayed, they will be seen on wall medallions as well as on blazer buttons.

s. [SEP] Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director for operations immediately thought the second strike was a terrorist attack. [SEP] The job of the NMCC in such an emergency is to gather the relevant parties and establish the chain of command between the National Command Authority-the president and the secretary of defense- and those who need to carry out their orders. [SEP] On the morning of September 11, Secretary Rumsfeld was having breakfast at the Pentagon with a group of members of Congress. [SEP] He then returned to his office for his daily intelligence briefing. [SEP] The Secretary was informed of the second strike in New York during the briefing; he resumed the briefing while awaiting more information. [SEP] After the Pentagon was struck, Secretary Rumsfeld	went	to the parking lot to assist with rescue efforts. [SEP] Inside the NMCC, the deputy director for operations called for an allpurpose "significant event" conference. [SEP] It began at 9:29, with a brief recap: two aircraft had struck the World Trade Center, there was a confirmed hijacking of American 11, and Otis fighters had been scrambled. [SEP] The FAA was asked to provide an update, but the line was silent because the FAA had not been added to the call. [SEP] A minute later, the deputy director stated that it had just been confirmed that American 11 was still airborne and heading toward D.C.

[SEP] On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. [SEP] Minutes	went	by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. [SEP] Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. [SEP] At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. [SEP] Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to "engage or "take out" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: "I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out.

SecDef: We can't confirm that. [SEP] We're told that one aircraft is down but we do not have a pilot report that did it. [SEP] As this exchange shows, Secretary Rumsfeld was not in the NMCC when the shootdown order was first conveyed. [SEP] He	went	from the parking lot to his office (where he spoke to the President), then to the Executive Support Center, where he participated in the White House video teleconference. [SEP] He moved to the NMCC shortly before 10:30, in order to join Vice Chairman Myers. [SEP] Secretary Rumsfeld told us he was just gaining situational awareness when he spoke with the Vice President at 10:39. [SEP] His primary concern was ensuring that the pilots had a clear understanding of their rules of engagement. [SEP] The Vice President was mistaken in his belief that shootdown authorization had been passed to the pilots flying at NORAD's direction.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. [SEP] The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. [SEP] In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. [SEP] The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. [SEP] When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready allies in the Dutch. [SEP] From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. [SEP] The British were furious and	went	to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered.

[SEP] The city strides into the future while still holding hands with the past. [SEP] The historic heart of Amsterdam has remained unchanged mainly because of people power. [SEP] As in most cities in the world, during the second part of the 20th century property developers eyed the old canal houses with relish. [SEP] The price of land was soaring, and developers could make a tidy profit by demolishing them and replacing them with something modern. [SEP] Unfashionable buildings, such as the warehouses of the old docks, were simply left to the elements, deemed to be worthless. [SEP] Amsterdammers, though, had other ideas. [SEP] They	went	out onto the streets to fight for their city, barricading historic houses and occupying empty buildings in the warehouse district. [SEP] This was typical of the populace, and it wasn’t the first time; in fact Amsterdammers have been standing up for what they believe in for centuries.

tern end of the market square is dominated by the twin spires of Mozes en Aäronkerk (Moses and Aaron Church), a Catholic Church built in 1840 on the site of a secret chapel. [SEP] The Old Testament figures of Moses and Aaron were found depicted on gable stones in the original building and were set into the wall of the new edifice. [SEP] The fine towers are actually wood rather than stone. [SEP] They were painted to match the sandstone walls in a 1990 restoration. [SEP] Waterlooplein — and its market — used to be much larger, but a massive building project begun in the early 1980s cut its size considerably. [SEP] Protesters deplored the loss of several old canal houses fringing the square which constituted much of what was left of the old Jewish Quarter. [SEP] Nevertheless, the construction	went	ahead, and the result of this labor is the Muziek Theater and Stadhuis, the front façade and entrance of which sits majestically on the Amstel River. [SEP] The attractive glass-fronted building was opened in 1986. [SEP] It is home to the Netherlands Opera and the National Ballet and also hosts a range of traveling companies in what is the largest auditorium in the Netherlands.

Byzantine and Ottoman Obscurity When Roman Emperor Constantine gave Christianity official sanction in 326, he looked for a “New Rome” in the eastern Mediterranean.

[SEP] Under Byzantine rule the city of Pericles sank into deep provincial obscurity. [SEP] It merited only a few brief mentions in the history of the following centuries. [SEP] Christianity had taken early root in Greece, as a result of St. Paul’s visit to Athens somewhere around 50 a.d. Polytheism, however, persisted until 529, when an edict by Emperor Justinian outlawed the last “pagan” temples and closed the famous Athenian schools of philosophy.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
Civil War Blockade Running Over the centuries, trouble on the nearby American continent has often meant good news for the Bahamas.

[SEP] Nassau harbor was busy with ships unloading Confederate cotton and tobacco and taking aboard arms, medicine, and manufactured goods, mainly from Europe, to be run back through the northern blockade. [SEP] As the war	went	on, speedy and camouflaged contraband vessels were built to slip past the ever-increasing Federal patrols.

d attack from invaders. [SEP] Its recent history is fascinating: In the 1930s it was owned by Swedish millionaire Axel Wenner-Gren, an arms manufacturer who was found to be a Nazi sympathizer. [SEP] He sold the island to Huntingdon Hartford, who changed the name from Hog to Paradise and created a beautiful private retreat, now the Ocean Club Hotel. [SEP] Later gangster Per Lansky began the process that transformed the island from a private sanctuary with magnificent homes into a playground for tourists. [SEP] The wonderful beaches, such as Cabbage Beach on the northern coast, were the focus of the development. [SEP] The first hotels began to appear in the 1960s when gambling was a lure to the rich and famous. [SEP] As Paradise Island saw owners Donald Trump and Merv Griffin come and go, it	went	through a continuing series of developments and re-developments. [SEP] Today Paradise Island may be close to fulfilling the dream of the perfect vacation playground. [SEP] It has many of the essential ingredients needed: fine white-sand beaches, a protected marina, a golf course, a group of fine hotels, and perhaps the biggest adult playground this side of Las Vegas. [SEP] The brainchild of the Sol Group, Atlantis Paradise Island is a new concept in resorts — it’s a huge hotel with an amazing theme park and entertainment village all on one site. [SEP] The resort takes its name, and inspiration, from the lost city of Atlantis, said by some to lie off the coast of Bimini. [SEP] This theme runs throughout the whole resort.

This tiny patch of land, 63 sq miles in area, is at the center of a momentous turning point in history, for it was here that Christopher Columbus first made landfall in the New World, on 12 October 1492. [SEP] One can only imagine the relief of his crew, and perhaps Columbus’s own sense of satisfaction that his theories had proved to be correct (though not entirely, since he assumed he had found the Indian subcontinent). [SEP] Around the shoreline of San Salvador are four separate places that are purported to be the site of Columbus’s landing. [SEP] No one will ever know for sure, of course, but the competition continues. [SEP] After the Spaniards	went	on to other islands in the Caribbean, the island became a base for English pirate John Watling; indeed until 1926 it was known as Watling’s Island. [SEP] The interior of San Salvador is dotted with lakes; there is a great deal of marshy land and only one major road. [SEP] Cockburn Town (pronounced “KOE-burn”) is the capital. [SEP] Pride of place in the town goes to the small jail found by the main coast road. [SEP] It’s now a museum because, as one resident said, “we don’t have no need for no jail.” (The opening hours are irregular.)	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
a Agung (god-king) of Gelgel, near Klungkung. [SEP] His men even succeeded in turning back the tide of Islam for a short while, adding eastern Java and Lombok to his domains. [SEP] During his rule, Balinese power, culture, and influence reached a peak, with a boom in temple building and the associated crafts of sculpture and woodcarving. [SEP] During the next 250 years, Bali’s rulers fell to squabbling among themselves and the island split into ten or more rajadoms. [SEP] Bali’s contact with the Dutch was restricted to providing slaves — mainly Balinese who had broken the rajas’ laws or priests’ taboos — and soldiers for the army of the United Dutch East Indies Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC). [SEP] The company was the instrument of influence of the Netherlands until it	went	bankrupt in 1799 and was superseded by the government. [SEP] Throughout the 18th century, Dutch influence and authority slowly spread across the Indonesian archipelago, but bypassed the relatively poor, unimportant island of Bali. [SEP] Between 1811 and 1817, during the Napoleonic Wars, Britain took control of Indonesia and seriously thought of staying once the wars were over. [SEP] Britain’s administrator, Stamford Raffles, who was named Lieutenant Governor, even visited Bali, and may have had it in mind to build a trading station here. [SEP] After the war, however, the British government decided to restore Dutch territory and interests — and Raffles found another site, the island and future port of Singapore.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] The country’s limited foreign-exchange reserves were squandered on window-dressing projects, grand monuments, and stadiums to host the Asian Games of 1962, seen as part of a plan to bring Indonesia into the world spotlight. [SEP] International travel agents were given a tour of the country, including a visit to Bali that coincided with an important Balinese ceremony in March 1963 at the so-called “mother temple” Besakih, on the slopes of the island’s highest mountain, Gunung Agung. [SEP] Portentously, Gunung Agung, though long dormant, chose this particular moment to begin emitting smoke and firing rocks into the air, but the ceremony	went	ahead anyway, literally under a cloud. [SEP] The official guests had scarcely left Bali when Gunung Agung exploded in what was the most violent eruption the island had seen in centuries. [SEP] Lava flowed down its slopes, but despite the impressions conveyed by reporters (and by photographs seen in many books), it covered only a limited area. [SEP] The chief instrument of destruction was the volcanic ash that showered down on the northern half of Bali, covering it with a layer 40 cm (15 inches) thick. [SEP] Crops were wiped out; the rice terraces were devastated, and starvation threatened. [SEP] The ash fall also blocked rivers, but the dams it formed could not retain the waters for long.

[SEP] Mataram has the array of government institutions found in every Indonesian provincial capital, as well as tree-lined residential streets with many opulent houses. [SEP] Cakranegara (or just Cakra — remember that it is pronounced “Chakra”) grew up around the palace of the Balinese rajas. [SEP] Today it is the commercial center of Lombok. [SEP] All that remains today of the royal compound is the 1744 Mayura Water Palace, the former meeting hall and court of justice standing in the middle of a lake and reached by a causeway guarded by old cannons. [SEP] This was the scene of a short-lived Balinese victory over Dutch troops in 1894. [SEP] The result was reversed only weeks later and the Dutch	went	on to take over the whole island. [SEP] Across the way, Pura Meru, the biggest temple in Lombok, was built in 1720. [SEP] It has three meru-topped shrines dedicated to Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu. [SEP] The huge wooden drums in the outer courtyard are sounded, calling the Hindu community to festivals and ceremonies.

For all of Barcelona’s exuberant architecture, the city’s modern district is a model of rationalist urban planning, a rigid geometric grid dryly called “the Extension.” [SEP] The outrageous and conservative, one learns, coexist here without much fuss. [SEP] Barcelona’s expansion came about in a remarkable burst of urban development. [SEP] By the mid-1800s Barcelona was bursting at the seams and suffocating inside its ring of medieval walls. [SEP] A municipal competition was held in 1859 to select a plan for a new quarter between the old city and the Collserola hills. [SEP] The job	went	to a road engineer named Ildefons Cerdà, whose plan quintupled the city’s size in a matter of decades. [SEP] Eixample construction by elite Barcelonans transformed the city into a showcase of extravagant modernista architecture, and the swank Passeig de Gràcia became the place to be seen. [SEP] Barcelona used the 1888 Universal Exposition as an open house to show the world its new face. [SEP] The place to begin a modernista tour is definitely on Passeig de Gracia and its single, hallucinatory block popularly known as Manzana de la Discordia (“Block of Discord”) between Consell de Cent and Aragó.

Since the time of the First Opium War (1839–1842), Western nations had been pushing China to open its doors to foreign trade. [SEP] In 1860, during the Second Opium War, British and French troops forcibly occupied Beijing and exacted treaty rights. [SEP] Foreign delegations, businesses, and missionaries poured into the capital, taking up residence in the Legation Quarter, located just southeast of the Forbidden City. [SEP] In 1900 the Legation Quarter was attacked by the Boxers, a radical nationalist group that had the tacit support of the Qing court. [SEP] In retaliation for this unsuccessful attempt to expel Westerners from Beijing, military forces representing the eight foreign nations resident in the capital	went	on a rampage, destroying the national library and even setting fire to the Summer Palace. [SEP] Thereafter, the Legation Quarter exercised complete control over its own affairs, becoming its own foreign city within the city of Beijing. [SEP] Many of the European-style embassy buildings, offices, banks, hotels, and mansions of the period have survived, although all have been converted to other uses since the revolution of 1949.

he venerable city gates and towers remain standing today. [SEP] China’s first subway system now makes a loop that retraces the foundations of the city walls, with the subway stops named for the ancient city gates. [SEP] Tiananmen Square was substantially enlarged, Chang’an Avenue widened, the Great Hall of the People built, the Museum of History and the Museum of the Revolution opened — all in the 1950s. [SEP] Old neighborhoods began to be replaced by modern brick-and-concrete highrises. [SEP] Beijing became its own powerful municipality (not part of any province), the seat of the new revolutionary government for the nation. [SEP] The Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) closed Beijing’s doors to the outside world. [SEP] Mao and his most radical followers shut down the nation’s institutions and	went	on a witch hunt for those alleged to harbor politically incorrect thoughts, behaviors, or backgrounds (which at times seemed to include anyone not waving Mao’s Little Red Book). [SEP] Many of Beijing’s temples and historic sites were not only closed but severely damaged, all in the name of making a complete break with the feudal, superstitious past. [SEP] Renovations as a result of this era of cultural destruction are not yet complete, and some ancient sites have never reopened.

Western Hills When China’s rulers really wanted to escape the heat of the city, they	went	farther west than the Summer Palace to the Western Hills (Xi Shan), romantically known today as Fragrant Hills Park (Xiangshan Gong yuan). [SEP] Imperial villas first dotted these hillsides — 27 km (17 miles) from Beijing — more than 800 years ago. [SEP] But it was the Qing Emperor Qianlong who converted the Western Hills into a formal mountain retreat for the enjoyment of the court, complete with its own temples, lakes, gardens, and even a zoo. [SEP] Late autumn is the favorite season for park visitors these days, when leaves turn a fiery red. [SEP] However, locals as well as tourists come to the Western Hills year round for the natural beauty and historic sites. [SEP] Two renowned temples still survive in the Western Hills.

The Third Reich Communist hostility towards the Social Democrats split the opposition to the Nazis. [SEP] Hitler became Chancellor on 30 January 1933. [SEP] Only a month later, on 27 February, the Reichstag	went	up in flames. [SEP] Hitler used the fire as a pretext to eliminate Communist and all left-wing opposition from German political life. [SEP] The Nazi reign of terror had begun. [SEP] Flames were the leitmotiv of the Third Reich in Berlin. [SEP] On 10 May 1933, a procession brought thousands of students along Unter den Linden to the square before Humboldt University. [SEP] They carried books, not to a lecture but to a bonfire on which were burned the works of Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, Stefan Zweig, Albert Einstein, and Sigmund Freud, as well as Proust, Zola, Gide, H.G.

the Third Reich in Berlin. [SEP] On 10 May 1933, a procession brought thousands of students along Unter den Linden to the square before Humboldt University. [SEP] They carried books, not to a lecture but to a bonfire on which were burned the works of Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, Stefan Zweig, Albert Einstein, and Sigmund Freud, as well as Proust, Zola, Gide, H.G. Wells, and Jack London. [SEP] In 1936 a flame was brought from Athens to Berlin to inaugurate the Olympic Games, an attempt at Aryan propaganda which was soundly destroyed by black athlete Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals. [SEP] In deference to foreign visitors, all anti-Semitic signs such as Juden unerwünscht (Jews not wanted) were removed from shops, hotels, and cafés. [SEP] As soon as the foreigners had left town, the signs	went	up again. [SEP] Discrimination against Jews moved inexorably to the night of 9 November 1938, when synagogues and other Jewish-owned buildings were burned. [SEP] In the midst of the smashed glass of the looted shops, German wit eased the discomfort by referring to the event as Kristallnacht (Crystal Night). [SEP] Berlin’s Jewish population, which stood at 170,000 in 1933, was reduced by emigration and extermination to around 6,000 by 1945.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
The gate itself, designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, was built between 1789 and 1791. [SEP] With two rows of six Doric columns forming the gateway proper, it was inspired by the Propylaeum gatehouse leading to the Parthenon in Athens. [SEP] (To go all the way, Hitler had even planned to hoist the gate onto an artificial hill, in an attempt to create a mini-Acropolis.) [SEP] Forming part of the city wall, the gate was intended by the more pragmatic Prussians not so much as a triumphal arch as an imposing tollgate for collecting duties. [SEP] The gate was left isolated in no-man’s land when the Wall	went	up, and subsequently became the scene of quite ecstatic celebrations when it came down, though now you would scarcely believe it as Berliners cross nonchalantly from east to west through Brandenburg’s mighty central arch. [SEP] The new US Embassy is being built nearby, on land originally occupied by that country’s pre-war embassy, and a large stretch of ground leading towards Potsdamer Platz has been designated as the site of a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
re sent out on the Plough to join three pioneers who had volunteered to hold the fort. [SEP] Defenses were built and the town of St. George’s was established at the east end of Bermuda, near the spot where the Sea Venture castaways had first landed. [SEP] The Bermuda Company was then created to administer the island. [SEP] News of the British settlement agitated the Spanish. [SEP] After all, a Spaniard had discovered (and given his name to) Bermuda. [SEP] Philip III of Spain was urged by his advisors to act immediately to force the British out. [SEP] Two ships were dispatched with orders to evaluate the situation. [SEP] As they approached the island, the small British population created a number of ruses to convince the Spanish that Bermuda was well defended; two salvos fired from a cannon	went	across the bay. [SEP] The Spanish fell for the ploy and fled, grossly overestimating the strength of the English garrison, which couldn’t have mustered a third shot at that time. [SEP] Bermuda’s Britishness was affirmed. [SEP] A Growing Colony	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-history.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
A Growing Colony Progress was swift during the first few years of the colony’s existence. [SEP] In 1619 the congregation of St. Peter’s Church moved into a permanent building, and Bermuda’s parliament met in an enclosure still visible amid the pews. [SEP] But it was soon decided to separate the secular from the religious, and a new government building	went	up. [SEP] State House, Bermuda’s first stone structure, is still standing today in St. George’s. [SEP] An English surveyor, Richard Norwood, undertook a study of the terrain, dividing the colony into the nine “tribes” that are the parishes (counties) of today and the origin of the numerous “Tribe Roads” still to be seen across the island. [SEP] Of the nine parishes, all but St. George’s were named after prominent shareholders in the original Bermuda Company.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-history.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
new colony, whose major crop was tobacco. [SEP] In reality, Bermuda could never compete with the crops produced in Virginia, but it began to develop a plantation system, including the importation of slave labor. [SEP] The slaves were treated a bit better than were those on islands farther south, and slavery was finally abolished in Britain (and Bermuda) in 1834. [SEP] The initial centuries of enforced settlement, followed by emancipation and the ensuing years of equality, have produced Bermuda’s modern biracial society. [SEP] When agriculture failed to be profitable, the ingenious settlers looked for other ways to make a living. [SEP] Bermuda sits astride the main whale migration route, and because the motherland and other colonies demanded (and paid well for) the oil, the local population	went	into the whaling business. [SEP] Once the colonists were good enough seamen to land whales, it was perhaps only natural that they might turn their skills to another historical marine tradition: piracy. [SEP] The practice evolved modestly, perhaps even legally, from the salvaging (called “wrecking”) of treasure found on ships grounded on the local reefs. [SEP] From there it was easy to make the transition to taking goods by subterfuge or by force. [SEP] Smuggling was so commonplace that it passed almost unnoticed.

From the bank, head for Queen Street, which leads north from the Birdcage, a metal cage once used by police officers to direct the traffic that regularly comes to a halt on Front Street. [SEP] It was designed by a Mr. Bird, although it also has a resemblance to “Tweetie Bird’s” cage. [SEP] Traffic lights now regulate the junction. [SEP] Remember to look right as you prepare to cross the road! [SEP] On the left as you walk up Queen Street is Perot Post Office, named after the man who was appointed Bermuda’s first Postmaster General in 1821. [SEP] He had actually been acting as “unofficial” postman for several years, meeting the ships and putting the letters under his hat before touring the town to deliver them. [SEP] William B. Perot (pronounced “Pea-rut”)	went	one stage further in 1848 when he began to produce his own postage stamps; only 11 are known to exist today, making each one extremely valuable. [SEP] The little Post Office is very much as Perot kept it, neat and simply furnished. [SEP] The building still houses an active post office, which makes it an appropriate place to buy the stamps for your postcards. [SEP] Bermudian stamps always have a colorful and interesting design; perhaps you can start a collection by buying a set for yourself. [SEP] Just behind the Post Office is a building that houses the Bermuda National Library and the Historical Society Museum, prime collections devoted to important historical documents and artifacts from the island.

A Bewitching City In Salem magic bookshops, fortune tellers, a witch house, dungeon, and museum all recall the town’s witchcraft trials of 1692, but there is much more to this town than witches. [SEP] Start at the National Park Visitors Center at Museum Place (on Essex Street), where you can pick up some literature and a map of the Heritage Trail. [SEP] Visit the outstanding Peabody Essex Museum, where the exhibits tell the story of the development of this very wealthy seaport town, which produced America’s first millionaire, Elias Hesketh Derby. [SEP] Kids always love the Salem Witch Museum, a diorama show that tells the story of the witch hysteria when 19 people	went	to the gallows.

Peace lasted for the rest of the century and the country made great economic strides as a province of the Habsburg empire. [SEP] Factories, theatres, and newspapers were opened and Pest expanded its role in international trade while Buda regained its status as Hungary’s administrative centre. [SEP] But prosperity was not for the majority. [SEP] The rich were getting richer while the serfs were getting poorer, and the Magyar identity was being repressed by the influence of the Germanic Habsburgs. [SEP] In the mid-19th century, the Hungarians once again	went	to war for their independence. [SEP] The rebellion of 1848 was led by a group of young intellectuals, including the 25-year-old radical poet, Sándor Petoﬁ. [SEP] A provisional government was formed, headed by Lajos Kossuth, but it was short-lived. [SEP] The Emperor Franz Joseph I summoned help from the Czar of Russia and the revolt was crushed in 1849.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
and Lake Champlain. [SEP] By 1854 more than 250 miles joined Niagara and Windsor. [SEP] The dream of a transcontinental railway with freight revenues drew financiers to the Grand Trunk project to join up Montréal, the Great Lakes, and the western hinterland. [SEP] But initially they had to content themselves with luring American trade to the St. Lawrence by linking eastern Canadian cities to Portland, Maine. [SEP] Choosing a permanent capital for these United Provinces wasn’t easy. [SEP] In the perennial Anglo-French conflict, bilingual Montréal was too troublesome, while English-speaking Toronto or French-speaking Québec City would favor one community at the expense of the other. [SEP] Royal Engineer officers sent watercolors of likely sites for Queen Victoria’s approval. [SEP] The choice	went	to Bytown, a puny lumber depot renamed Ottawa after the river on which it stood, diplomatically situated between Upper and Lower Canada. [SEP] To the east, and remote from the centers of power, the people of Newfoundland and the Maritime Provinces lived in small, isolated communities with no unifying geography comparable to the Great Lakes or St. Lawrence River. [SEP] Newfoundland turned its back on the hostile interior to reap the harvests of the sea. [SEP] Always psychologically closer to London than to Ottawa, Newfoundland did not become part of Canada until 1949.

ns, as they are known to American anthropologists. [SEP] The Blackfoot of Alberta are a classic example. [SEP] Their name, says the myth, was bestowed on them when an ancestor, on his way to meet another tribe, walked through land burned by prairie fire and blackened his moccasins. [SEP] For these great hunters of the Rocky Mountain foothills and prairies, wild game included grizzly and black bear, antelope, deer, elk, wild sheep, and goats, but the only “real meat” was buffalo. [SEP] Before the early 1700s, when horses appeared on the scene, guile was more important than speed, and hunters stalked the buffalo herd disguised with the skins of wolf and buffalo calves. [SEP] Horseback hunting brought new skills and prestige to an élite that had been given no other duties. [SEP] The Blackfoot	went	to war with Shoshoni and Crow Indians, to the south, for their horses, and were in turn attacked by the Cree from the north for their territory’s great buffalo herds. [SEP] Buffalo was everything to these tribes — food, clothes, and tents; and twelve to fourteen buffalo skins were needed to construct a single teepee. [SEP] So the cultural and ecological shock was all the greater when the herds were exterminated in the 1870s. [SEP] Métis and Cree Indians were devastatingly efficient with their repeater rifles, and the transcontinental railway builders made a deliberate policy of clearing the tracks of migrating buffalo. [SEP] By 1877, under the Canadian government’s Blackfoot Treaty, the native peoples gave up their hunting grounds to raise cattle on reserves instead.

This is the grand parade drive along the Ottawa River to the town’s smartest residential neighborhood, home of ministers and “Embassy Row.” [SEP] The Neo-Gothic Basilica of Notre-Dame (Sussex at Guigues) was born with the capital. [SEP] The Catholic cathedral’s steeples	went	up in 1858, though the whole church was not completed until 1890. [SEP] Québec sculptors Louis Philippe Hébert, Philippe Parizeau, and Flavien Rochon carved the pulpit, choir stalls, organ loft, and bas-reliefs. [SEP] Turn off on St. Patrick Street to drive through Nepean Point Park to a statue of Samuel de Champlain, founder of Québec, who looks west along the Ottawa River with his Huron Indian scout. [SEP] Here he still has the astrolabe that he lost on his explorations.

The Photographs Collection covers the history of the art from William Henry Fox Talbot through Eugène Atget, Walker Evans, and August Sander to the contemporary work of Diane Arbus and Paul Diamond. [SEP] The august Victoria Memorial Building at Metcalfe and McLeod Streets houses museums created with the treasures uncovered by the Geological Survey of 1841, predating the foundation of Canada itself. [SEP] The survey	went	beyond geology and mineralogy to study the uncharted country’s paleontology and anthropology, its climate, forestry, and botany. [SEP] In the National Museum of Natural Sciences in the east wing, the star attraction is Dinosaur Court, devoted to the 75,000,000-year-old beasts excavated in Alberta. [SEP] The museum is a good place to look at the country’s rich wildlife as a primer to your own explorations of the Canadian forests and mountains. [SEP] The National Museum of Science and Technology (1867 St. Laurent Boulevard) is in the style of science through fun and games.

 town was known as Pile of Bones until they were ground up for fertilizer. [SEP] Today, you’ll find the buffalo, along with other regional wildlife, prehistoric and present-day, in the Museum of Natural History, on Albert Street. [SEP] The museum is south of the city center in the very pretty Wascana Park, one of the few places in southern Saskatchewan where you’ll see any trees. [SEP] The creek has been dammed to form a lake, with a bird sanctuary out on Willow Island. [SEP] Also in the park is the provincial Legislative Building, with an interesting portrait gallery of Indian chiefs on the ground floor. [SEP] On Lakeview Drive is the Diefenbaker Homestead, brought here from near Saskatoon to give a vivid insight into the simple country life led by Saskatchewan’s most famous son before he	went	off to Ottawa “to show them Yanks and Ruskies a thing or two.” [SEP] Headquarters of the famous Mounties in the 1880s until moved to Ottawa, Regina keeps the Royal Canadian Mounted Police College as a major training center (north of the airport at the end of 11th Avenue). [SEP] Visit the barracks, crime laboratories, and Centennial Museum, which traces Mountie history from the first clashes with gold-rush panhandlers to wartime reconnaissance and latter-day counter-espionage. [SEP] The old mess hall is now the “Little Chapel on the Square,” where the stained-glass windows portray not saints but Mounties, notably a reveille bugler and guard in mourning.

rivers, rain was a precious resource and the Maya saw any stock of water, such as the limestone water holes or cenotes, as holy places. [SEP] The rain god Chaac was a very important deity, whose image can be seen at every Mayan site. [SEP] But there was a dark side to this sophisticated society. [SEP] The Maya viewed their gods not as benevolent guides but as changeable spirits in need of constant appeasement. [SEP] To incur the wrath of the gods would result in drought, a loss of crops, and certain starvation. [SEP] To keep the gods happy, the people offered sacrifices at their great pyramid temples. [SEP] The ceremonies were overseen by a powerful caste of high priests. [SEP] Grain and animals were used, but the gods came to demand more, and a cult of human sacrifice grew. [SEP] The Maya	went	out on raiding parties, taking hostages from the surrounding lands to use in their bloody ceremonies. [SEP] The murals and reliefs at Mayan cities tell gory tales of beheading and the tearing out of human hearts to appease the lords of the underworld. [SEP] Archaeologists dredging the Sacred Cenote of Chichén Itzá have recovered dozens of human skeletons, thought to be the remains of victims sacrificed to the rain god. [SEP] Mayan civilization in the northern Yucatán reached its peak around a.d. 900–1200. [SEP] For reasons still unknown — perhaps civil war, drought, or disease — the great cities were abandoned.

In the Wake of Cortés The first recorded Europeans to arrive in the Yucatán, in 1511, were doubly unfortunate: a group of Spanish sailors survived a shipwreck on the coast of what is now Quintana Roo, only to be sacrificed by the Mayan natives. [SEP] However, two were allowed to live as slaves and one, Gonzalo Guerrero,	went	native and married the chief’s daughter. [SEP] His children were the first mestizos — the people of mixed Indian and Spanish blood who now make up 55 percent of the Mexican population. [SEP] In 1517, an expedition led by Francisco Hernandez de Cordobá landed on the west coast of the Yucatán, near Campeche, but were beaten back by a hail of arrows from the hostile natives. [SEP] However, the following year, ambitious, young Captain Juan de Grijalva discovered the island of Cozumel and skirted the coast of the peninsula, hearing tales from the Indians of the great civilization of the Aztecs.

[SEP] Though he had begun his campaign without the King’s authority, once news of the treasures captured by Cortés reached Madrid, a royal warrant was dispatched to legitimize the victory and create “New Spain” — the latest Spanish colony. [SEP] However, it was left to Don Francisco de Montejo, “a gentleman of Seville,” following in the great conquistador’s wake, to take possession of the Yucatán in the name of the Spanish king. [SEP] Arriving on the coast in 1527, Montejo’s forces were hindered by the dense jungle and withering climate, and were met by fierce resistance from the natives. [SEP] To make matters worse, news of great riches discovered in Peru led many of his men to desert in search of greater rewards. [SEP] The campaign	went	so badly that by 1535 the Spaniards had been completely driven out of the Yucatán. [SEP] In 1537 another force, under the command of Montejo el Mozo (the Younger), Don Francisco’s son, set out to plant the Spanish standard on Yucatecan soil. [SEP] At first ill fortune dogged them; the dwindling force was besieged in Champotón, on the west coast, for two miserable years. [SEP] With reinforcements, the Spaniards managed to establish a beachhead. [SEP] A band of only 57 men, led by Montejo el Mozo’s cousin (yet another Don Francisco), marched inland to take the Mayan village of T’Ho.

Mao Zedong’s “Great Leap Forward” (1959) was designed to mobilize the masses in a crash program of economic growth, but it kept the country in turmoil and brought unconvincing results. [SEP] At about the time the Leap was suddenly reversed, relations between China and the Soviet Union plunged from polite to frosty to hostile. [SEP] China cut off relations with the world and tested its own nuclear bomb. [SEP] From 1966 to 1976, China was convulsed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. [SEP] Millions of young Red Guards	went	on the rampage, and the whole country set about memorizing the maxims in Mao’s Little Red Book. [SEP] Thousands perished and much of China’s cultural heritage was destroyed as a vestige of feudalism. [SEP] Changes came in quick succession in the 1970s. [SEP] The US president, Richard Nixon, visited China in 1972, thus normalizing relations between the two countries. [SEP] In early 1976 the widely admired prime minister, Zhou Enlai, died. [SEP] Eight months later, in September, death came to Chairman Mao himself. [SEP] Mao’s widow, the one-time film actress Jiangqing, and her close associates (the so-called Gang of Four) were arrested, tried, and imprisoned for encouraging the excesses of the Cultural Revolution.

[SEP] It remains one of China’s more Christian cities. [SEP] The twin-spired Catholic cathedral (Tianzhu Jiaotong) and the Protestant church (Jidu Jiaotong), with its working clock tower, tend to be crowded with local people on Sundays and have become tourist attractions. [SEP] German Qingdao suffered a curious fate during World War I. Japan, which joined the Allied forces, invaded the city, imprisoned the survivors of the German garrison, and occupied Qingdao for the duration of the war. [SEP] China wasn’t able to regain sovereignty until 1922. [SEP] After the Communists came to power in 1949, industrial development	went	forward. [SEP] However, even though the population now exceeds 4 million (including the outlying regions), Qingdao keeps its quiet allure. [SEP] As permanent as any of the German contributions to Qingdao is its brewing prowess. [SEP] The local beer has become China’s national beer, exported worldwide in big green bottles or modern cans under the old spelling of the town’s name, “Tsingtao.” [SEP] Brewery tours can be arranged, and the Qingdao International Beer Festival in mid-August has become China’s first attempt at an “Oktoberfest.”	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
Ningbo (Ningpo), Zhejiang Province. [SEP] Situated down the coast from Shanghai, this port town has a long history of overseas connections. [SEP] First it was involved in trade with Japan. [SEP] Then the Portuguese arrived and settled here. [SEP] Finally, a British consulate was established in the town after the end of the Opium Wars. [SEP] The sights include a thousand-year-old wooden temple and a Ming Dynasty library in a pretty garden. [SEP] Qufu (Chufu), Shandong Province. [SEP] The birthplace of Confucius has been turned into an architectural ensemble on the scale of the Forbidden City in Beijing. [SEP] The memorial temple was begun in 478 b.c., the year after the philosopher’s death, and improvements and expansions	went	on for another 2,000 years.

 were quickly dashed, and Spain was plunged into a century of power struggles at home. [SEP] Overseas, her American colonies revolted and gained independence. [SEP] Soon there was little left of the once great Spanish empire, and an attempt in 1873 to form a republic failed. [SEP] In 1902, Alfonso XIII became king at the age of 16. [SEP] His reign was a difficult time for Spain; prosperity and stability eluded the country, which remained neutral during World War I. [SEP] In 1923, assailed by economic problems and with catastrophe imminent, the king accepted a general, Miguel Primo de Rivera, as dictator. [SEP] Six years later the opposition of radical forces resulted in Primo de Rivera’s fall. [SEP] Neither reform nor the maintenance of order seemed possible. [SEP] In 1931 the king himself	went	into exile following anti-royalist election results, and another republic was founded. [SEP] Parliamentary democracy was impeded by the ideological commitment of various political factions and compromise was rare. [SEP] There was a succession of right-wing attempts to govern and Spain floundered in a sea of political strikes and violence.

nish soil, as well as oranges, peaches, and pomegranates. [SEP] The manufacture of paper and glass was another Moorish innovation. [SEP] Skilled engineers and architects, the Moors built numerous palaces and fortifications. [SEP] As superb craftsmen they excelled in the production of ceramics and tooled leather, as well as delicate silverware. [SEP] The ensuing fall of Córdoba was as remarkable as its rise. [SEP] In 1009, the caliphate splintered into a number of small kingdoms called taifas, which were constantly at war. [SEP] The Christians in the north, seeing the enemy weakened and divided, captured the taifa of Toledo. [SEP] Under threat of attack, the other taifas sought help from the Almoravids, fanatical Berber warriors. [SEP] The Berbers marched against the Christians in 1086, and	went	on to reduce Moorish Spain to a province of their own North African Empire. [SEP] For a time, therefore, the affairs of Muslim Spain were administered from the Almoravid headquarters in Granada, until they lost their grip on the peninsula, softened by their life of ease in Andalucía. [SEP] The pattern repeated itself a century later when the Moors invoked the aid of the Almohads in 1151. [SEP] These primitive tribesmen, who came from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, soon made themselves the masters of southern Spain. [SEP] They constructed major fortifications, such as Sevilla’s Alcázar, endowing the Moors with sufficient strength to resist the Christian forces a while longer.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
The Golden Age With the triumph of Christianity, the country was united under the Catholic Monarchs (Los Reyes Católicos), a title conferred by Pope Alexander VI on Ferdinand II of Aragón and Isabella I of Castile. [SEP] Also in 1492, Cristobal Colón (Christopher Columbus) discovered the New World in the name of the Spanish crown. [SEP] Fanatical in their religious zeal, the king and queen expelled all Jews who refused to convert to Christianity in the same year, and the Moors followed in 1502. [SEP] The rulers thus reneged on the promise of religious freedom they had given when Granada surrendered. [SEP] With the Jews who left Spain	went	many of the country’s bankers and merchants, and with the Moors, a good number of its agriculturists and laborers. [SEP] The converted Jews (conversos) and Moors (Moriscos) who remained in Spain were viewed with suspicion by the Inquisition, which had been established by the Catholic Monarchs to stamp out heresy. [SEP] Many were condemned to death, and still more fled the country to escape persecution. [SEP] The 16th century was glorious for Spain, with the conquest of the New World bringing much prestige and wealth. [SEP] In 1503, the Casa de Contratación in Sevilla was awarded a monopoly on trade with Spain’s territories in the Americas.

By comparison, the coastal settlements languished, and were subject to frequent raids by Barbary pirates.

[SEP] As Emperor, Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire, the first Habsburg Spanish king, turned his attention to events in Europe. [SEP] Between 1521 and 1556, he	went	to war with France four times, squandering the riches of the Americas on endless military campaigns. [SEP] Charles also had a weakness for such costly projects as his vast Renaissance palace on the grounds of the Alhambra, which he commissioned in 1526. [SEP] Taxes imposed on the Moors served to finance the building works, which eventually had to be abandoned for lack of funds when the Moriscos revolted 12 years into the reign of Philip II (1556–1598). [SEP] The king dispatched his half-brother, Don Juan of Austria, to quell the rebellion, which ended in 1570 with the defeat of the Moriscos and their eventual dispersal. [SEP] In 1588, Philip II prepared to invade England, only to be repulsed when the English navy destroyed Spain’s previously invincible Armada. [SEP] The defeat marked the st	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
On the Andalucían coast, the 19th century was a time of tentative expansion. [SEP] With piracy at an end, a number of towns and villages grew up along the shoreline, and the extension of the railway line to Almería in 1899 promoted the early development of the eastern region. [SEP] Alfonso XIII, just 16 years old, assumed the crown in 1902. [SEP] Prosperity and stability continued to elude the country, which remained neutral during World War I. Against a murky background of violence, strikes, and regional strife, the king accepted the dictatorship of General Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1923. [SEP] Seven years later, the opposition of radical forces toppled Primo de Rivera from power. [SEP] Alfonso XIII	went	into exile following anti-royalist election results in 1931, and another republic was founded. [SEP] Parliamentary elections in 1933 resulted in a swing to the right, and public opinion became polarized. [SEP] When the left came out on top in the elections of 1936, the situation deteriorated at an alarming rate. [SEP] It came as no surprise when, six months later, General Francisco Franco led a large section of the army against the socialist government. [SEP] Support for the Franco-led nationalist uprising came from monarchists, conservatives, and the right-wing Falangist organization, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, while liberals, socialists, Communists, and anarchists sided with the government.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3

[SEP] Support for the Franco-led nationalist uprising came from monarchists, conservatives, and the right-wing Falangist organization, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, while liberals, socialists, Communists, and anarchists sided with the government. [SEP] The bloodshed lasted no less than three years and cost hundreds of thousands of lives. [SEP] General Franco emerged as the leader of a shattered Spain. [SEP] Many Republicans	went	into exile; others simply disappeared. [SEP] The Republican mayor of Mijas caused a sensation when he finally surfaced in the 1960s after three decades in hiding — in his own home. [SEP] Franco kept Spain out of World War II, despite Hitler’s entreaties to the contrary. [SEP] The Spanish nation gradually healed its wounds, though conditions in the country were difficult and life was far from easy.

Founded by Phoenician traders more than 3,000 years ago, it came under Carthaginian and Roman rule before falling to the Moorish invasion force in 711. [SEP] The Moors fortified the city, developing the settlement into a major trading port serving Granada, and it was one of the last cities in Spain to be re-conquered by Christian forces in 1487. [SEP] A good place to begin a tour is at Málaga’s principle landmark, Gibralfaro (from the Arabic Jebel al Faro — Lighthouse Hill). [SEP] Located some 130 m (425 ft) above the city, this hilltop is capped by the ramparts of a Phoenician castle reconstructed in the 14th century by the Moors (who	went	on to build the lighthouse that gave Gibralfaro its name). [SEP] The restored walls and parapets offer a superb panoramic view of both the city below and the coastline disappearing into the horizon. [SEP] Because it looks down on the Plaza de Toros, the hill also acts as free seating for bullfights taking place below. [SEP] Although it is possible to walk here, it is not recommended. [SEP] Not only is the pathway somewhat difficult in places, it is also a well-known hangout for muggers. [SEP] Best, then, to take a taxi. [SEP] Back at sea level is the delightful Paseo del Parque, with contrasting fountains at either end, which connects the old town with the Plaza de Toros. [SEP] On its south side, it is a lush seaside tropical garden enhanced by fountains, duck ponds, and small bars.

Outskirts of Alicante Outside town, on the main Valencia highway, the Monasterio de Santa Verónica (Saint Veronica’s Monastery) attracts about 15,000 pilgrims and a good many hawkers during the annual May celebration of the Santa Faz (Holy Face). [SEP] Armed with canes decorated with bunches of rosemary, the participants proceed on foot to the monastery, where they venerate the Holy Face cloth that, according to tradition, retained the bloodstained image of Jesus’ face after Saint Veronica used it to wipe his brow as he	went	to Calvary. [SEP] The sacred relic was first worshipped in the Alicante region during a drought in 1489. [SEP] As it was being carried across the site of the present-day monastery, the Santa Faz is said to have suddenly become too heavy to hold, and believers claim that a tear fell from the right eye of the image. [SEP] This was interpreted as a sign to construct the building which has housed the cloth ever since. [SEP] It can be seen at the high altar or in a chapel off the sacristy.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
xpanding number of buildings are being spruced up with the assistance of UNESCO and foreign foundations, but many others are propped up by wooden columns, lean-tos that appear to be merely forestalling the inevitable. [SEP] Their arcades, fluted pillars, and mosaic tiles are teetering on last legs, praying for restoration miracles. [SEP] At night the deep darkness of the streets is punctuated only by the neon glow of TV sets from tiny front rooms and the occasional headlights of a small colony of gas-guzzling vintage Chevrolets and Plymouths. [SEP] Havana’s distant era lives on. [SEP] Legendary places plucked from the pages of popular novels and the lives of fiction writers need little input from visitors to evoke their storied past: Graham Greene’s Hotel Sevilla, where “Our Man in Havana”	went	to meet his secret service contact, and Hemingway’s favorite watering holes (El Floridita and La Bodeguita del Medio) and the Hotel Ambos Mundos, where he penned much of For Whom the Bell Tolls. [SEP] Old Havana is best experienced on foot, although you can also pick up a bicitaxi (pedicab) to get to the Malecón or the museums at the district’s edge.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
War on the Mississippi Less than two months after Louisiana won its statehood, the United States	went	to war with Britain — for the second and last time. [SEP] To everyone’s surprise, New Orleans became the stage for the most glorious, indeed the only, American victory of the whole conflict. [SEP] The War of 1812 was fostered by accumulated American grievances. [SEP] There were dramatic naval battles and a final ghastly defeat for the United States when the British burned down the city of Washington. [SEP] Finally, the warring parties focused on New Orleans. [SEP] A British flotilla, diverted from the Caribbean, sailed up the Mississippi with some 10,000 first-class troops. [SEP] The Americans rushed Major General Andrew Jackson to New Orleans to command the city’s defense. [SEP] Out-manned and outgunned, Jackson mobilized a force of somewhat irregular members: an unlikely coalition of mili	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_NewOrleans-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
d executive branches of the government. [SEP] None of these reforms pleased the Russians and Prussians, who continued to covet Polish territory. [SEP] Russia invaded Poland and in 1792-1793 it, along with Prussia, imposed a second partition of Poland, annulling the constitution and essentially divying up the country between them. [SEP] Tadeusz Ko§ciuszko, a hero of the American War of Independence, led a military insurrection in 1794, defeating the Russians with a mostly peasant army. [SEP] The uprising was quashed, however, and in 1795, Poniatowski was forced to abdicate. [SEP] A third partition crushed Poland and placed the country under the control of Austria, Prussia, and Russia. [SEP] Poland ceased to exist — its very name was abolished by treaty — for the next 123 years. [SEP] Warsaw	went	to Prussia, Kraków to Austria. [SEP] In desperation, Poland looked to Napoleon Bonaparte and Revolutionary France for assistance against its oppressors. [SEP] Napoleon defeated the Prussian army in several key battles and established a semi-independent Duchy of Warsaw from 1807 to 1815. [SEP] Napoleon gained an ally in Józef Poniatowski, a heralded military leader and the nephew of the last king. [SEP] The 1812 Polish War re-established the Poland-Lithuania border, but Napoleon’s troops were crushed as they advanced on Moscow. [SEP] Napoleon suffered a great defeat, but his ally Poniatowski refused to surrender, preferring to sacrifice himself and his troops. [SEP] The suicidal mission became an important rallying cry for Poles during the remainder of the 19th century.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Poland-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
asco da Gama’s legendary sea voyage from Lisbon in the summer of 1497 — immortalized in The Lusiads (1572), the epic poem by Portugal’s national poet, Luís de Camões (1524–1580). [SEP] Rounding what is now known as the Cape of Good Hope, da Gama found what Columbus had been searching for in 1492 (although in the wrong direction): the sea-route to the lucrative spices of the East. [SEP] The Portuguese thus ended the Venetian monopoly on Eastern trade and began attracting merchants from all over Europe to Lisbon. [SEP] Portugal and Spain, the planet’s foremost maritime powers, agreed to divide the world between them by means of the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas. [SEP] This accorded everything lying more than 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands to Spain, while everything lying to the east	went	to Portugal, thus giving Portugal a free hand in exploiting the Orient. [SEP] In 1500, Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral accidentally reached Brazil. [SEP] Trading posts were set up all along the west and east coasts of Africa, in the Middle East (Hormuz), southern India (Goa), Malaysia (Malacca), and even in China (Macau). [SEP] Profits came primarily from trading in eastern spices, silk and porcelain, African gold, and slaves, as well as through importing copious sugar from Brazil and São Tomé.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
Washington gradually began to grant Puerto Ricans a greater degree of self-government and representation. [SEP] In 1900 the first civil governor was appointed (all the appointed governors were Americans until 1946). [SEP] In 1917 Puerto Ricans won a mixed bag of benefits: they were given more say in their internal affairs, made citizens of the United States — and declared eligible for conscription in World War I. [SEP] In the years between the World Wars there were continued efforts to change the island’s status and improve its quality of life. [SEP] Some, such as those who followed radical Pedro Albizu Campos, took to violence, which resulted in several assassinations, though many more insurgents worked within the system. [SEP] More Puerto Rican draftees	went	to war in 1941. [SEP] Even while poverty lingered from the Great Depression, World War II caused continued hardship on the island because of its isolation in a dangerous sea. [SEP] But the 1940s saw the emergence of two great political figures: Luis Muñoz Marín, son of Muñoz Marín Rivera and founder of the new Popular Democratic Party, and Rexford Guy Tugwell, Governor of Puerto Rico from 1941 to 1946. [SEP] These two men were instrumental in orchestrating an amazing economic expansion that almost single-handedly converted the island from an underdeveloped backwater into a pace-setting industrial society. [SEP] Under “Operation Bootstrap,” which attracted hundreds of new factories to Puerto Rico through tax and other incentives, the per-capita income soared to the highest in Latin America. 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
Old San Juan Old San Juan is without doubt one of the most spectacular sights of the Caribbean. [SEP] Founded in 1521, it is partially surrounded by walls and fortifications that have protected it from modernization and indiscriminate development. [SEP] The carefully preserved historic houses and public buildings retain many of the most charming features of the original Spanish colonial architecture. [SEP] Cobblestone streets (the stones were brought as ballast on the Spanish ships, which	went	home filled with treasure and gold), tiny squares, and grand plazas surprise visitors at every turn as they wander the neat grid of streets planned four centuries ago. [SEP] Only eight blocks wide, San Juan can easily be covered on foot, though there are some steep ascents that may be challenging in the Caribbean heat. [SEP] Even if you only have one day, you’ll be able to enjoy its delights. [SEP] If possible, however, take at least a couple of days. [SEP] Enjoying a rest in a shady plaza or taking a long lunch at an outdoor café are just as much a part of your trip as a tour around the museums. [SEP] San Juan is a living city, and it’s especially bustling after dark, when crowds throng to the bars and restaurants or simply stroll the narrow streets and airy plazas.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
The Nao trade route continued until the early 1800s, when José María Morelos y Pavón, a hero of Mexico’s War of Independence, took over Acapulco and stopped the trade, sending the town into a century-long respite, a hiatus that ended only when the Mexican government paved the highway between Mexico City and Acapulco. [SEP] The beautiful beaches of Acapulco Bay immediately lured Mexico City’s elite, and the metamorphosis began, from slumbering trading port into the “Pearl of the Pacific,” as the media came to know it in the 1930s. [SEP] The first airplanes from the US began to arrive in the mid-1930s, and with them came a bevy of notorious visitors, from movie stars to presidents, writers to millionaires. [SEP] Acapulco became the playground for the rich and famous. [SEP] Glitzy hotels	went	up in a hurry, supported by new boulevards, power plants, and a superhighway. [SEP] Acapulco’s peak was the 1940s to 1960s. [SEP] Celebrated images included Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner sipping margaritas while watching cliff divers at La Quebrada, President Eisenhower meeting Mexico’s President López Mateos for a summit conference in a new high rise hotel, and Johnny Weissmuller swimming laps in the Flamingos Hotel pool overlooking Acapulco Bay. [SEP] Since those glory days Acapulco has aged — maybe not quite as gracefully as its fans would have hoped. [SEP] However, the “Perla del Pacífico” still attracts scores of vacationers, who are still regaled by old stories about the rich and famous, told by seasoned waiters as they serve pool-side drinks with a weathered but unwavering smile.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	3
