For example, biographical accounts of physicist Marie Curie, co-discoverer of radium and twice winner of the Nobel Prize, invariably make reference to her father’s untiring efforts to provide his children with ideas and games to ﬁll their spare time.52 A chest of colored blocks had special meaning. Marie and her older siblings used the blocks to represent cities, mountains, rivers, countries, and continents. Their father, a high school science teacher, often joined in, capitalizing on play as a way to teach geography. In the home in which Marie Curie grew up, one biographer summed up, “play was learning and learning was play.”53<n>In poet Sylvia Plath’s childhood, stories and storytelling were pervasive. As a 2 1/2-year-old, Sylvia was intensely jealous of her sickly younger brother for consuming so much of her mother’s attention. While the baby nursed, Sylvia sat nearby on the ﬂoor, impatient and unhappy. Her mother discovered that she could defuse Sylvia’s envy with a game in which Sylvia spread out the newspaper before her, picked out all the capital letters on the page, and pretended, in a very grown-up way, to read—an achievement that attracted much parental admiration. Sylvia’s mother often made up bedtime tales, serialized from one evening to the next. Almost as soon as they could talk, Sylvia and her brother responded in kind with limericks, poems, and fantastic stories of their own. On walks to their grandparents’ house and on long car trips, favorite books invariably came along, offering ready inspiration for the children’s imaginative creations.54<n>Filmstar Charlie Chaplin’s mother was herself a talented comedy actress and singer. As a young child, Charlie often accompanied her when she went to work at the theater. As a result, playacting and impersonating became an early focus of Charlie’s pretending. One evening during a performance, his mother’s voice failed. In a pinch, the stage manager, who had seen Charlie at play, led the little boy onstage in her place. Charlie continued his playacting unabated, which included songs, dances, and impersonations from his mother’s repertoire. He was demonstrating the wares of his ﬁrst and best teacher in the art of make-believe, and the performance evoked a roar of appreciation and a shower of coins from the crowd.55<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Adivinanzas (Riddles)<n>Adivinanzas are riddles. Many Chicano children remember being entertained with riddles narrated by parents and grandparents. A riddle is an intellectual brainteaser, in Spanish called a quebracabeza; facts are framed in the form of a question in such a way that the respondent cannot possibly know the answer. An example in Spanish is, “Qué camina de cuatro patas por la mañana, dos patas en el medio día, y tres patas en la noche?” (What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night?) The answer is man, who as a child, in the “morning” of life, crawls on four legs; as an adult walks on two legs; and as an old man uses a cane for support, thus walking on three legs. Another example is a “true riddle,” which is a comparison of something to the unknown answer, and that something is described in the question. For example, “Tengo ojos y no miro; boca pero no hablo; qué soy?” (I have eyes and cannot see; a mouth, but cannot speak; What am I?) The answer is a photograph. Another type of riddle is the conundrum, where the answer is contained in the riddle itself, such as “Agua pasa por mi casa cate de mi corazon” (Water passes by my house pain of my heart). The answer is “agua-cate” (avocado). Or, “Lana sube, lana baja” (Wool goes up and wool goes down). The answer is “la navaja,” la-na-baja (the knife). Conundrums contain wordplay and in Chicano culture are sometimes bilingual, playing with words in both the Spanish and the English language. Another type of riddle is the riddling question, such as “Qué le dijo la luna al sol?” (What did the moon say to the sun?) The answer is “Eres tan grande y no te dejan salir de noche” (You are so big and yet are not allowed to go out at night).<n>Many Spanish riddles collected in the Southwest reflect in some way the characteristics of the Southwest, both linguistically and environmentally. Since the problem presented in a riddle is linguistically and culturally based on both the teller’s and the audience’s culture, they must all be members of the same community or group to comprehend the puzzle. Bilingual riddles, those narrated in both English and Spanish, are clearly a Chicano invention growing out of the bicultural experience. Riddles are fun and educational as well. It is usually children who enjoy telling and listening to riddles. Like other folklore genres, riddles serve a function, helping children learn to interpret facts and form an opinion. They use language, humor, and a verbal fun activity to challenge a child’s intellect.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt
When K is the maximum value, N - , as in Figure .a–c, then each gene influences the fitness contribution of every gene. This is the totally interconnected system. Since fitness values are assigned at random for the to the (K + ), or to the N input configurations when K = N - , it is easy to show that the resulting fitness landscape is fully random.<n>A main feature of random landscapes is that there are nearly exponentially many local peaks, indeed the number of local peaks is to N/(N + ). For N = , there are local peaks on the landscape. Finding the global peak by hill climbing is improbable, and the system becomes trapped on a local peak. Other features include the lengths of walks via fitter neighbors to nearby peaks, which scales as the logarithm of N, and the way directions uphill dwindle on walks uphill. At each step uphill, the fraction of directions uphill is cut in half, yielding exponential slowing in the rate of finding fitter variants, hence, rather general laws about the rate of improvement slowing exponentially that we will discuss in the next chapter on “learning curves” in economics.<n>Now, on to coevolution and the evolution of the structure of fitness landscapes. Figure . shows a frog and fly, each characterized by an NK landscape, coupled together. Each of the N genes in the frog receives inputs from K genes in the frog and C genes in the fly, and vice versa. Thus, the sticky tongue of the frog aects the fitness of the fly via the presence or absence in the fly of slippery feet, sticky stu dissolver, or a strong sense of smell for sticky frog tongues. To accommodate the C couplings, each gene in the frog looks at K + C inputs and has its table of random fitness contributions augmented with new random decimals. So too for the fly feeling the eects of the frog.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
I have discussed my own model primarily to focus on the fact that coevolution by self-natural selection alone acting on individuals alone can tune landscape ruggedness so those landscapes are self-consistently well searched by the creatures searching them and their search mechanisms. We can, and presumably do, self-consistently coconstruct ourselves, our niches (and hence problem spaces), and our search mechanisms such that, on average, we propagate ourselves and our descendants. It has worked for . billion years. Were our fitness landscapes such that we could not search them, we would not be here. We coconstruct our ways of making a living and search out better ways of making a living while we jiggle one another.<n>The NK model is but one crude model of coevolving organisms and their coupled deforming landscapes. More generally, each organism has traits that are aected by many genes, the polygeny discussed above, and each gene aects many traits, the pleiotropy alluded to above. It is interesting to note that were organisms to evolve to a position below but near the biological reality that is the proper analogue of the Ksat phase transition, such a location might well achieve the gradualism and capacity to persistently evolve that Darwin noted and that we observe. Both the gradualism and capacity to evolve are related to the number of alternative assignments of true or false to the V variables that satisfy the Ksat normal disjunctive form. If there are connected pathways from one such assignment via -Hamming-mutant neighboring assignments that all satisfy the normal disjunctive form, then adaptive walks via alternatives genotypes are available, all of which roughly generate the same organism. Gradualism is achieved. Polygeny and pleiotropy tune landscape ruggedness and deformability, which tune coevolutionary dynamics, perhaps to a self-organized critical state of an ecosystem.<n>There are, in short, dimly understood laws that allow the coevolutionary construction of accumulating complexity. And it appears that such coevolution typically is self-organized critical. The NK coevolutionary model is not the only example of a model exhibiting self-organized critical behavior of model ecosystems. Bak and colleagues, Ricard Solé, and others have created elegant models aiming in the same direction. In particular, Solé’s model comes closest to fitting the actual slopes of the observed power laws, which are -.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt

The canalside streets of Oudezijds Voorburgwal and Oudezijds Achterburg southwest of Oude Kerk are home to the infamous Amsterdam Red Light District, known to Amsterdammers as the Walletjes or “little walls.” As with any large port, prostitution was rife from the earliest times, and although the Calvinist Protestants tried to stamp it out it has thrived to the present day. What makes the situation different in Amsterdam in modern times is that the industry has been legitimized and regulated in an attempt to curb the most disturbing facets of exploitation and in order to address health concerns. The prostitutes are entitled to regular health checks and are expected to pay taxes on their earnings — yet another example of the Dutch people’s trademark pragmatic approach when it comes to tackling society’s difficult issues. The area is safe — except perhaps in the early hours of the morning — and filled with tourists. The tree-lined canals and old narrow iron bridges are some of the prettiest in the city, and prostitutes ply their trade behind relatively discreet windows, not on the streets.<n>At ground level, seedy or amusing ( depending on your point of view) shops sell sex wares, attracting customers from all walks of life; but don’t get too distracted, else you’ll miss the rows of dainty gables, quirky wall plaques, and window boxes brimming with flowers, which give the whole area a cheery feel. Don’t be surprised to find offices, shops, and restaurants living side by side with the brothels here — it’s all part of Amsterdam life.<n>At night the streets come alive with bars, clubs, and adult shows. It is one of liveliest parts of the city after dark. Just make sure that you stay on the busier and well-lit thoroughfares as you make your way back to your hotel.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Since World War II, the Bahamas has worked hard to extend the service it provided during Prohibition and has turned itself into a “paradise” for holiday-makers. The dazzling beaches are covered with fine sand that ranges from bright white to pastel pink. The sun shines year-round, with temperatures ranging from the high 60s to the high 80s fahrenheit. To these natural ingredients have been added just about every amenity and service needed for the perfect holiday. Everything centers on New Providence, where most of the tourists stay and half of the Bahamian population lives. One of the largest cruise ports in the world, Nassau can accommodate 15 large ships at one time. English “pomp,” stout forts, and colonial houses attract history buffs. Grand Bahama, the second most populous island, has Freeport–Lucaya, Nassau’s younger, less genteel “American” cousin; nightlife here is more lavish and audacious than in Nassau. Both islands have large resort hotels that offer water-sports, floor shows, and casinos where you can enjoy the thrill of winning or the dejection of losing. Golf courses entice you to lower your handicap. Tour buses plow a path around the attractions, and duty-free shops tempt you to buy that little luxury item you’ve been denying yourself for so long. Hundreds of day-trippers cruise to both islands, eager to do it all before they have to get back on the boat.<n>On the smaller and more remote islands — called the Out Islands or Family Islands — intimate resorts cater to your every need and make it possible for you to forget about schedules, deadlines, and traffic jams. The most difficult decision you’ll have to make is what to pick from the extensive dinner menu. While the clubs and casinos may not play on into the night, during the day you’ll be worn out by walks along the beach and other strenuous activities, such as collecting sea shells, enjoying long lunches, and applying sunblock. The whole trip could prove to be exhausting!<n>The lure of the Bahamas is, of course, as much about the sea as it is about the land. The waters of the western Atlantic are still some of the clearest and most beautiful in the world. In summer the shallows are glassy still and range from azure blue to emerald green; the deep ocean channels reflect a deep blue that can best be appreciated from the air. The sandy shallows are ideal for swimming and snorkeling, and since the development of scuba (an acronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) gear in the 1930s, the seas around the Bahamas have become a top destination for diving enthusiasts from around the world.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-Intro.txt
Golf courses at Nusa Dua and up in the mountains at the Bali Handara Kosaido Country Club are both top-class, staging tournaments which bring some of the world’s best players. There’s a 9-hole course at Sanur, and at Lombok there is the 18-hole Suranadi course. Many hotels offer their own tennis courts, some floodlit for evening use. Air-conditioned squash courts are available at a few places. As the sun starts to set, informal soccer and volleyball games between visitors and locals begin on the beach at Kuta, Tuban, and Legian.<n>Walking in the countryside is one of the great pleasures of Bali. Don’t start at the southern resorts, which are a long way from the best scenery, but begin instead up in the hills, where it’s cooler. In Ubud, the Bina Wisata Information Center or your hotel can give you information on walks along the Campuan Ridge, or through picturesque local rice fields. Bookstores in Ubud sell detailed maps, including Bali Pathfinder and Ubud Surroundings, that will help guide you along country pathways. Keep Walking Tours (<balitrade@denpasar.wasantara.net.id>) at the Tegun Galeri shop in Jalan Hanoman offers one- to seven-hour guided walks; Victor Mason’s highly praised Bali Bird Walks (Tel. 0361 975 009) includes lunch, water, and use of binoculars. Both are very reasonably priced. At Munduk, in the beautiful mountains southwest of Lovina, Puri Lumbung Cottages (see page 134) offers an excellent program of walks, treks, and courses in local arts and crafts.<n>More arduous and serious mountain treks include climbing the active volcano Gunung Batur — a trek of several hours — and the crater rim and lake of Gunung Rinjani (on Lombok), which demands at least three days to complete.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhatToDo.txt
The site of the monastery is spectacular, tucked into folds of rock high above the plain. On the eve of the saint’s day, 27 April, the monks hold an all-night vigil attended by crowds of people. La Moreneta looks down from a gold-and-glass case above and to the right of the altar in the basilica, but the faithful can touch or kiss her right hand through an opening. At 1pm and 7pm (except in July), the choir boys of the Escolanía, one of the world’s oldest music schools, founded in the 13th century, fill the basilica with their angelic voices. The congregation joins in at the end of the service to sing Montserrat’s hymn, the Virolai, an expression of faith fused with a nationalist fervor.<n>Montserrat is also the goal of outdoor sports pilgrims like cyclists (who make the trip from Barcelona) and mountain climbers who ascend the spires of rock above the monastery. From the monastery there are walks to other hermitages and a funicular to the cave sacred to the legend of the Madonna. Statues and plaques line the paths. Montserrat is an extremely popular place, so there are several bars and restaurants set up to feed the hordes.<n>Montserrat can be reached in spectacular fashion by train from Barcelona’s Plaça d’Espanya. On arrival at the Montserrat station about an hour later, a cable car continues right up the side of the mountain to the monastery. A much-less preferable bus service also operates from Barcelona by Transportes Julià (Tel. 93/490 40 00). By car, leave Barcelona via the Diagonal and take the highway, direction Tarragona, exiting at Sortida 25.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
Recreation and Sports<n>Bermuda is an ideal vacation destination for outdoor activities. Summer brings warm (but not hot) weather and warm sea temperatures, making it ideal for diving, snorkeling, and other water sports. On land, you can fill your day with tennis and golf along with long walks and beach activities. In winter, the sea temperature makes it a little too cold for diving, but many visitors still enjoy swimming in waters warmer than at home, and all land activities are thoroughly enjoyable with the addition of a jacket or sweater.

Another area for safe and picturesque walking is along the sand dunes behind the South Shore beaches. These link the main public beaches (from Warwick Long Bay to Horseshoe Bay).

These two parks lie adjacent to each other, and are usually visited together — one entrance fee covers both. The main attractions are their giant sequoias, many of them approaching 3,000 years old, and the spectacular rock scenery of Kings Canyon. The forests offer a gorgeous array of dogwoods, sugar pines, and white and red firs, and a rich flora of orange leopard lily, lupine, bracken fern, chinquapin, and white corn lily.<n>Start at the Visitor Center at Lodgepole or Grant Grove, where you can pick up a map and information about the best forest walks and back-country hikes, and perhaps watch their interesting audio-visual presentations about the parks.<n>The best introduction to the forest is Congress Trail. It’s an easy 2-mile (3-km) walk, but worth lingering over for a couple of hours to absorb the beauty of the largest living creations in nature. The trail begins at the General Sherman Tree, the biggest of them all. Measuring 274 ft (84 m) tall, 103 ft (31 m) around its base and still growing, it’s one of the largest living organisms in the world. Reaching up for light well above the rest of the forest, the first branches start 130 ft (40 m) above the ground.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
Running southwest from the Parc de l’Esplanade, the broad, modern Grande-Allée runs past the Assemblée Nationale (provincial parliament), built from 1877–1886 in the favored style of the time, French Renaissance. This has been the citadel of Québec’s quest for a special identity in or outside the Canadian Confederation, especially under Prime Minister René Lévesque.<n>On Boulevard St-Cyrille, the Grand Théâtre de Québec was inaugurated in 1971 as Québec City’s arts center and home of the Québec Symphony Orchestra. Battlefields Park (Parc des Champs de Bataille, 390 rue de Bernieres) is devoted to the momentous battle on the Plains of Abraham that decided the fate of Québec in 1759. Quite apart from its historical significance, the park offers delightful walks across the treelined fields. In the center of the park you’ll see a massive Martello tower, built in 1805, as part of Québec’s new defenses against a potential American attack. In a town where every monument seems like a political statement, rue Wolfe leads to one on the spot where General Wolfe was mortally wounded, while anonymous Québécois patriots have responded with a statue of Joan of Arc, off the Avenue George VI.<n>In the southern half of the park, the Musée de Québec possesses a first-rate collection of Québécois painting and sculpture, as well as historic furniture, jewelry, and gold and silver church ornaments. The sculpture is principally from the 18th century, but the paintings range from the colony’s beginnings to the present day. Look for the historical studies of Joseph Légaré, the portraits of Antoine Plamondon and Théodore Hamel, and landscapes of Cornelius Krieghoff. Among the moderns are the Automatiste abstracts of Jean-Paul Riopelle and the optical art of Jacques Hurtubise.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt

There are several approaches to Las Cañadas National Park and Mount Teide. The park is well sign-posted from the road via La Orotava, but if you are coming from the north, then the most picturesque route is via La Esperanza. The small town soon gives way to a lush forest of giant pines and eucalyptus trees. Four km (21⁄2 miles) south at Las Raíces is where Franco met with his co-conspirators in 1936 (see page 20). An obelisk in the forest commemorates the event. As the road gains altitude and temperatures fall, the views become ever more spectacular. The Mirador Pico de las Flores looks out over to the southeast and the Mirador de Ortuño offers a panorama of the northern coast. Highest of all at over 2,000 m (6,562 ft), Mirador las Cumbres reveals Teide in all her glory.<n>The entrance to the National Park is El Portillo de las Cañadas, where there is a visitor center (open daily 9am–4pm). If you wish to walk in the park, pick up a leaflet or ask for information about the daily guided walks. Note that during winter the environment can become quite harsh, and you should never undertake walks without consulting staff at the visitor center first. At this point it is quite likely that you will be in the clouds; temperatures are very low, and in winter there may well be snow on the ground. The landscape becomes very lunar-like; it was around here that some of the filming for Planet of the Apes took place. The ascent to the top of Mount Teide can be made by climbing, or by the new cable car (teleférico), an eight-minute ride (open daily 9am–4pm, admission: 2,500 ptas, r15.03). Most visitors choose the cable car, but it’s worth noting that even after leaving the cable car it is still a good climb to the summit at 3,717 m (12,195 ft). However, if you really want to venture that far you have to go in person and with a photocopy of your passport, to the Office of the Parque Nacional del Teide (Calle Emilio Calzadilla, 5, 38002 Santa Cruz de Tenerife). Even then, there is a daily limit of just 50 people, for conservation sake, allowed up the last 200 m (219 yards) to the summit. Once there, you should be able to count off all the other Canary Islands and, on a good day, see North Africa. Impressive as Teide is, it is basically no more than a peak on the edge of a giant volcano which long ago erupted or imploded. Left behind is the vast Caldera (volcanic crater) which is most apparent from the area known as Los Roques. Los Roques are a group of giant, flamboyantly shaped lumps of volcanic rock rising out of the crater; often visited and photographed.<n>The East and South Coast<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
Walking and Hiking<n>This is an ideal island to put on your walking boots and take to the countryside. You will be well-rewarded, with small remote villages, hidden churches, and a rural lifestyle to explore. Though Cretans are bemused as to why anyone would want to hike without any purpose but the pleasure of it, they have a genuine welcome for travelers on foot. Itineraries can range from easy flat short walks to steep mountain hikes, though it’s not advisable to head into the high peaks without a guide.<n>Gorge walks are particularly popular; the Samariá is the busiest and the longest. Other gorge walks include Imbros near Samariá, and the Valley of the Dead at Zákros on the eastern coast. The peninsulas off the northwest coast present dramatic and interesting walks. Akrotíri is the most populated though not as rugged as Gramvoússa and Rodópou, which are wild and windswept. Shorter itineraries could include the walk from Agii Déka to Górtis; from Mália to the Minoan site to the east; or from village to village in the Amári valley.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhatToDo.txt

Some 200 km (124 miles) west of the capital by road and half an hour by air, Pokhara is a major staging point for treks and one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. Almost as spectacular as the flight to Everest, the air route to Pokhara heads in the opposite direction, paralleling the high mountains toward Annapurna. Below, all signs of roads disappear, and it is clear how difficult road-building is in this tortuous terrain. The town, at 900 m (3,000 ft), is almost tropical, with bananas, papayas, and poinsettias growing in gardens. The contrast makes the stunning views of snow-capped Machhapuchhare, the famous “Fish Tail” peak dubbed the “Nepalese Matterhorn,” all the more marvelous.<n>Pokhara, on Phewa Lake, has the best views for the least expended energy of any location in Nepal. The Lakeside neighborhood, jammed with cheap hotels and restaurants, is where most Westerners congregate to rent bikes, shop for Tibetan wares that are sometimes cheaper here than in the capital, and drink cheap beer. On the airport side of town, there are several luxury hotels, and one of these, on the lake itself, is reached by a hand-drawn ferry. This is a starting and ending point for trekkers, and as such is filled with a mix of people in anxious anticipation of their impending adventure and those who have recently returned from exhausting treks. Everyone seems content to fill up on cakes and pies. Day hikes are a popular activity here, with the most popular hike being that to Sarangkot to see Dhaulagiri and the Annapurnas from the viewing tower. Other good walks include a visit to the Tibetan refugee camp at Tashiling and to the Peace Stupa atop the forested hill on the south side of the lake. You can also take a boat out on the lake or walk to Devin’s Fall, where a river disappears underground into a steamy hole. While most people look on this as a staging point for a trek, Pokhara is such a beautiful spot that it can be quite enough just to relax and enjoy the mountain scenery in the warm sunshine.<n>The road back to Kathmandu follows the Seti River for much of the way. A side road makes it easy to visit Gorkha, ancestral seat of the Shah dynasty and city from which the unification of Nepal was begun. Prithvi Narayan Shah’s large palace here has been restored by wood-carvers, and you can climb for half an hour up to the stronghold, which is now inhabited by priests. Looking out of a window onto the panorama of high mountains and wave upon wave of rolling hills, one can imagine the young prince saying to himself “This must be my kingdom.” In recent years Maoist activity in the area has limited the number of people visiting Gorkha.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
A visit to Lumbini, birthplace of Gautama Buddha, can also be made in about three hours from Chitwan. (There are also flights from Kathmandu to Bhairawa, the nearest airfield, with a bus service to Lumbini.) The story goes that Buddha’s mother gave birth to him under a tree in a garden at Lumbini, unable to get back in time to the palace, some 20 km (12 miles) away. Marking the spot is a pillar commemorating the visit in 250 b.c. of the Indian emperor Ashoka, a zealous convert to Buddhism. Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world come to Lumbini, and in recent years the site has been developed into an international cultural and religious park with several hotels and numerous Buddhist temples built by the world’s various Buddhist countries.<n>Although few tourists stray from the Kathmandu-Pokhara-Chitwan focal points, it is possible to see something of the undeveloped west without walking three weeks to get there. There are now several lodges at Royal Bardia National Park on the Karnali River. This park was created specifically as a preserve for tigers, which, with a little luck, can be seen here more easily than at Chitwan National Park. Elephant rides, jungle walks and drives, river rafting, and bird-watching keep visitors busy. The Karnali gorge above Chisopani is especially beautiful and is noted for the size of the fighting mahseer carp taken by sport fishermen.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
