Oh. [SEP] Lot of times we just sit around and just reminisce and	go	back to the time when we were growing up. [SEP] Family, um.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsElissa.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
It was? [SEP] Um, now why did you decide to stay in Charlotte to	go	to school? [SEP] Um, I wanted to be closer to my family, number one, and, um, number two, I have a lot of friends coming here, which helped me a lot, and, um, I just liked the Charlotte, um, UNC Charlotte because I wanted to be a, a nurse.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Even though I had freedom when I was, you know, home, whatever, but I still had a curfew. [SEP] But here in college you don't have, I mean you can do what you want to, come and	go	as you please. [SEP] Uh, you don't have to answer to anybody except yourself.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Work hard study balance your time, you know. [SEP] You can	go	out on the weekends but during the week it, you know, it should be study time. [SEP] Well thank you for sharing your experience with me.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
However, it didn't seem to be so horrifying. [SEP] It was a story and I, you know, you knew it was fiction, but I would	go	back and read, when I could read myself, I read everything. [SEP] I read the backs of cereal boxes.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
I just really didn't ever love poetry for some reason. [SEP] I still recall, and I'm sure your mother does too "Whose woods these are, I think I know His house is in the village though;" and I won't	go	beyond that but, uh, you recall that Gail, when we were, when I was in college and we were first dating that was a, a favorite poem of, uh, us and our friends. [SEP] Was that self-written?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So, that was such a racy and shocking book at that time, and so, of course, we had to read it. [SEP] I. [SEP] I liked, uh, oh	go	sh,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So you couldn't tell what kind, at night, what kind of people were	go	ing by, but you could hear clatter, because even beasts full of weapons, with, everything, you know? [SEP] So that time, that I told you about when the, the soldiers came, my son escaped, dying, from fear, when I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So, I came in, from where I was washing, I went in, and I didn't see what the guerrillas did with themselves, because I didn't see, they were in front, but since I went it, I didn't see. [SEP] Then, you know, that in order to keep yourself out of trouble, you	go	in and don't, then they come, or, that was another time, that I suffered a terrible threat when the soldiers come through. [SEP] And he said, "Ma'am," he said, "what did the guerrillas that were there eating do with themselves?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So he says, "No, from the school up, are all guerrillas." [SEP] I said, "The fact, you, I, you can be there," I said, "or I can stay here and you	go	in," I said, "you don't see where I get off to." [SEP] Then they left, they left for the mountain, they went on up.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
He says, "And it's	go	ing to be very dangerous and it's very late." [SEP] So, I said to him, "Oh, well, I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So, my brother said, "I'm	go	ing to cut her rope, I'm not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
That's how it was, it was said, but thank God in the family hardly-- The guerrillas also took out a man from the outskirts near the, the place where we lived, who was called Juan. [SEP] He was like a catequist, one of those people who helps the priests, and according to the guerrillas, they say that he was starting to get them in trouble with the army, I mean, he started to say where they were, so that the soldiers would	go	directly to where they were, and one day they (guerrillas) took him out and killed him. [SEP] And they put out the, the word that yes, they had killed him.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Because it was more diverse. [SEP] Like in most schools in Charlotte, if you	go	on other sides, it's like everybody's just white, but in my school, there was every kind of person you could ever meet. [SEP] So, I haven't met one person at UNC-Charlotte that I didn't meet in my high school.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Yeah. [SEP] Unless I'm like, when I	go	home for like Christmas break, after being there for like two weeks, it was like I'd never moved out and we get kind of like tense with each other. [SEP] Basically because we both, um, always think we're right.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Uh, funny. [SEP] Actually my first semester at Charlotte, I was a Pre-Business major to	go	into Marketing and Advertising, because I did that in high school, too. [SEP] But I never wanted to do that.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Because I'm like a lifeguard every summer and this year I had to get a winter job all year. [SEP] And it's hard to	go	from having like your whole day to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
To have something to fall back on and everything like that. [SEP] And I'm like, I'm trying to convince him to, you know, if I don't make it and there's a strong possibility I won't, I know that, I'm not stupid, I'm nor	go	ing to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Right. [SEP] And do all that, and I mean, if I don't make it, my life's not	go	ing to be over or something, like I can't	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And do all that, and I mean, if I don't make it, my life's not	go	ing to be over or something, like I can't	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
But he realizes it's not like that. [SEP] He could	go	and make more his self if he would get off his butt and do it. [SEP] What does he do?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Yeah. [SEP] Like neither, like I'm the first one in my family to	go	to college on my dad's side. [SEP] That must be a really big deal.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
I think that's why they expect so much more of me. [SEP] It kind of gets tiring and that's what I don't like, you know, I don't like to talk about myself when I	go	around my family. [SEP] You know they're all like, "Oh	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So that'll-- TAPE 1, SIDE B --work on stage and then	go	to L.A. and work in movies to begin with, anyway. [SEP] So you wouldn't stay in Charlotte?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Like, I mean, if let's say, I make it really big, you know, big, famous person or whatever, I'll live here. [SEP] And then I'll	go	and everything like that, when I'm big enough to make my decisions on, when people are sending me scripts by then instead of me having to like audition and stuff. [SEP] You have a	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
That's	go	od, though, you need to, I guess. [SEP] You can't	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So when I graduate, more than likely I'll move to Boston, but Charlotte has definitely been a nice place to live. [SEP] I've never experienced any problems with crime or anything like that, and there's always been something for me to do, like in high school or in college, there's always things to	go	do, so it's been a nice place to grow up. [SEP] Do you think it will be strange to move up north when you've lived in Charlotte all your life?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So, I don't know. [SEP] If you want to move so bad, why did you	go	to school here? [SEP] Uh, the reason I choose to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

Very close to my family. [SEP] I usually	go	home once or twice a month. [SEP] Don't you think that will be hard if you move all the way up there, not seeing them as much?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

I'm maybe, I'm maybe nine, 10 years old and uh, of all these adults assembled there not one of them had a pair of pliers or a wrench. [SEP] I fortunately remembered when Mom and I left to	go	to the church to bring a wrench and couple pairs of pliers because of course the pews were bolted to the floor.

So she, we would always fuss about her sitting with us but anyway this one morning I putting siding dad and I are putting siding on her house and nobody come to the door. [SEP] The door was unlocked and I had to get the windows open, so I just kind of	go	cruising through the house upstairs try to find my way to the window. [SEP] Well that window happened to be through her room, so I just kind of walked on through the room and she looked up at me and I said, "Good morning," and she just screamed.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
We were helping my niece and nephew paint a new house that they bought and uh, he uh, little Raymond was with us. [SEP] He said, "Daddy I have to	go	poo-poo."

Because that was, we would wake up at, at six in the morning. [SEP] We'd be sitting there waiting on daylight to be able to	go	to work. [SEP] Couldn't some mornings, couldn't even see just hoping that it would be cooler.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

I remember, yeah I remember that based on later conversations that I ( ) with him about it, but at the time I guess I really wasn't sure what it was about, but I knew that when it all came down to the bottom of it, I knew that what I had done was the wrong thing to do and he told me that I'm	go	ing to probably have to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

Was, she would eat peanut butter cups, and she knows that I hate the smell of peanut butter, so she would actually eat the peanut butter cup and then breathe in my face and there wasn't really any way for me to defend against that because I couldn't think of any food that she really thought stunk and you know it was like it was it was untouchable there wasn't anything I could do about that, so I would, I would get really mad at that and I'd say, "Mom, Mom," and she would say, you know, "She's just breathing," so there was really no way out of it, so I remember a lot of that. [SEP] So when I was in, when I was at grandma and grandpa's house, we used to have a great time just fishing and hanging out with grandpa, and my cousins would	go	there and every Fourth of July we'd do fireworks.

I don't have enough information. [SEP] So, I	go	in there, and I haven't even told him yet that I had to start from the very beginning, because I was like, I didn't want to tell him! [SEP] So and let me tell you I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

But anyway, uh, I had a top secret clearance in that, so in 19 and 57 why, uh, they started, uh, I didn't know why they was a running the clearance on me to begin because I thought uh, top secret was the highest you could	go	in security clearance, and, of course, that I knew, everybody in my neighborhood was asking me, "Well what if they're asking about you?" [SEP] And even uh, uh, a neighbor in Earl, NC told me that they was a checking with him on why, uh, uh, on why, uh, they was running a clearance on me.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
I didn't know anything about it until about the time, well, uh, I knew about it when they was running the clearance on me when I had a top secret, so I didn't know anything about what it was all about until I arrived.

[SEP] I didn't know what it was all about or anything till I had to	go	out and train hook in a ( ) in a RV57D, which I say now I found it, it was a forerunner to your U2 aircraft.

Well it	go	t to where there's two or three aircraft arrive in a week and I didn't know where they're flying to. [SEP] All we done, they never did tell us any place where they was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
You know, you can't, you cannot survive if you don't have any counter pressure, increase breathing pressure in those altitudes. [SEP] If, if your hand was exposed outside of the pressure suit, your hands would	go	to about five times the size, if you had a decompression. [SEP] Well of, of course, needless to say, we had a, we could not make a mistake.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Physiological support differs from life support in that he handles the altitude chambers which run pilots up to 80 thousand feet in high altitude chambers, and brings him back down. [SEP] They have to	go	through a number of altitude chambers, uh, rides before they start even flying U2's or flying with pressure suits.

Of course they already had done the pilot's bit before they done, well, I had to	go	through altitude chambers myself because I was working with pressure suits. [SEP] I went to Fort Worth, TX to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
I went to Fort Worth, TX to	go	through the altitude chambers with a partial pressure just like I was working with, and when, when all the training was done on the pressure suits and things, I was chosen with a sergeant secretary to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Then he'd dress me, and, uh, he'd set the injection on me and you, uh, uh, we'd have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then we'd come up breathing as hard as we could, and you better if uh, the, the, the top portion of your helmet surged, which you had rubber around the neck and the visor closed. [SEP] And, uh, if it surged and just kept surging it would	go	'whish,' and, like it was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
I would think, "Well, I'm, I'm	go	ing to let somebody else	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
They've, they chosen me over about 15 individuals there, to	go	to through that school and I'm not, I'm not. [SEP] So I would	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And so, well, anyway, uh, they chose me. [SEP] Also, oh, let me	go	through this. [SEP] About, uh, less than two months after uh, uh, we finished the school and was set the injections on pilots for about two months, Firewell and Company come up with an automatic, fool-proof uh, uh, that uh, the regulator adjusted itself with a little valve that moved back and forth.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
OK, well, that's where I went. [SEP] They chose me over everybody else, and, of course Sergeant Secretary, he was a different AFC, but he's the one that went through school with, they chose me to	go	out of the uh, uh, the organization that I was at on the present. [SEP] Now it's on the same base, but they've set, taken me to field maintenance to run regulators in the ( ) altitude chambers.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
That still stands today. [SEP] Uh, of course, I won't	go	but we, I have just so much I could talk about, but, uh, that is the main things that we, of course, everybody knows now that the, what has happened.

Uh, I went ahead up and it was highly classified, even my orders were classified. [SEP] So I went to, I went to Washington D.C. and I didn't	go	directly to, uh, that, uh, they had told me to on my orders. [SEP] I went to my sister's that lived there .	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
They asked a few questions and I answered them and they said, "Get your baggage and leave there immediately, and come to the address you were supposed to when you arrived in Washington."

[SEP] Of course, they questioned me there, why I went.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Well after they checked, they asked me about her husband. [SEP] After they checked, found out he was in security service with the Air Force, they said, "OK," I could	go	ahead back and stay there if I wanted and they gave me a certain time to report to the CIA Headquarters, which I can say that name, and needless to say, I was up there for a week and I, I can't say anything else what happened or anything. [SEP] But I didn't know what in God's world I was there for.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
They told me that, uh, that I would be called in a guy at the end for me to meet.

Different, totally different types parachutes and in an bird that flies, uh, three times the speed of sound, over 22,000 miles an hour.

I stayed with them until 19 and 69 before I left there. [SEP] And uh, course I won't	go	into anything else because I'm not prepared with my information here, but thank you very much.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

[SEP] In fact, when he came back, one time he gave me a beautiful large pearl, perfect pearl and years and years later, when my father died in 1978, I had, took some of the money that I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
That's just kind of a little aside from the war days. [SEP] But I can remember at that time that we'd	go	out to have uh we played softball and I happened to be, when I was 12 years old I was a freshman in high school.

There was someone in the car with him and I don't remember anything about that. [SEP] But I do remember that we stood and watched him	go	by and waved at him. [SEP] I don't remember whether he waved back or not so I did get to see President Roosevelt himself and in person so that was a big thrill for me as a young person.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Another experience that I remember very clearly was riding on the train from, we were	go	ing down to see my grandparents at Bradenton, Palmetto, FL actually below Tampa. [SEP] And we would	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
I had a small child had a two and-a-half year old and a baby. [SEP] And I can remember that I had one of the first boxes of disposal diapers and I stood up in the train in the center of the train to	go	to the restroom and take Donna and change her diaper and she went to the bathroom and it all came down my dress and down her leg and puddled on the floor. [SEP] And so much for disposable diapers.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

I had previously broke the window by throwing a baseball through it on, by accident. [SEP] Well, we was replacing this window, and we	go	t it fixed, and my dad was like, "Let's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And he said a few words, and he didn't want to move me because he, he saw the way I fell and thought maybe I'd broke some ribs or something and he didn't want to move me. [SEP] So I am laying here in the middle of the road, and he kept asking if I am all right and I was like, "Yeah I'm all right," because I knew something was wrong with me, and I hate hospitals and, and I don't want to	go	to a hospital if something happens to me. [SEP] But uh, I was like, "I'm all right."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and I was like, "Yeah I'm OK Mom. I don't need to	go	to the hospital or anything like that, I am fine." [SEP] And she	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So I opened my mouth, and I couldn't get it, I couldn't shut it back. [SEP] You had to	go	to the hospital like that ?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Yeah. [SEP] She was like, she was like, "OK you	go	t to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Did they put you to sleep? [SEP] Nah, well like that night they told me they'd let me	go	home and stuff from the hospital, and my, I mean my, before I went to bed my dad was like, "Well you	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Well, that night I couldn't sleep at all because it felt like a brick wall, a brick, I mean a brick wall was on my head, so much pressure was on my chin and stuff, my jaw. [SEP] So the next morning we	go	and it was Doctor Trevez I believe. [SEP] That's who did my um,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Uh-huh. [SEP] So uh, I had to	go	through that in high school. [SEP] And you know, people started doing the "Kevin Talk."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
That's right. [SEP] How did you	go	about doing that? [SEP] Oh we had assignments where, um, we had to, um, write out the definition, actually write out, you know, using the word in a sentence.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Well, not really, not as unusual as you might think. [SEP] But, um, when we moved to VA, and I started to	go	to school here, um, the rejection I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Umm, high school was when I would write it down and keep it! [SEP] I mean I have things now that I can	go	back to, uh, poems that I wrote in high school, but I was writing before that, I just, you know how things just disappear? [SEP] Yes.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And, I really appreciated the original stories from this perspective. [SEP] He captured personalities in a way that, um, I still	go	back to th, those, uh, Pooh and Eeyore. [SEP] When I'm, my husband and I talk personality a lot and, you know, what personality type is a particular person and we really found it to be very helpful in understanding them and we realize that no one is one personality type; we're all conglomerates.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
At, at that point in time I wasn't even thinking in the personality realm, and I hadn't drawn any connection to it. [SEP] Um, it was, it was, just, um, more of my, you know, how the teenagers	go	through, uh, "Trying to find myself", a questioning period? [SEP] And that was one of the poems that came out of my, "Who Am I?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And one of the things that I have found, whether it's in a movie or a book, it's	go	t to engage me psychologically on some level. [SEP] I mean, I don't really	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So, you don't mind re-reading? [SEP] Oh, no, especially, that's how I know what my favorite books are because they are books I	go	back to. [SEP] Go back to--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Now I'm the kind of person, I'm very sequential, I've	go	t to know what the end is! [SEP] I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Um-hum. [SEP] They	go	too many different places without bringing some level of resolution to whatever the, uh, issue is that they're dealing with, you know. [SEP] Jumping around with three different kinds of story lines, that does not appeal to me	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
at all! [SEP] Are you in the habit then, since you	go	to the back of the book for the mysteries, are you having to do that with the other readings? [SEP] Um, sometimes.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
There's something, well not only that aspect of the way that the writer, he writes, he basically gives two different endings to the story. [SEP] You know, you could stop at the answer that satisfies and think that that's the end of the story, but then you	go	to the next chapter and it's like, "Ah ha!" [SEP] Um-hum.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And, um, all of her children are, are readers. [SEP] And, um, she definitely believed that education was a essential and, "You will	go	to college!" [SEP] So that was something that was definitely handed down.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And I um, try to keep my piles under control. [SEP] And periodically I have to	go	through and I will	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And the depiction, the, the, the story that she depicts, um, is so, to me, has so many aspects of a true, the struggles of our lives, that every time I read it, because I'm a little different, I get something a little different from it. [SEP] And that's one that I give it away, and then have to	go	get another copy! [SEP] Because I always want that in my library.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Because I always want that in my library. [SEP] I always want to be able to	go	back and read it again. [SEP] Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

And the two grandmothers had nothing in common but each one really gave me quite a gift. [SEP] Grandmother Tina had traveled, uh, as the wife of a military man herself and had a real interest in adventure in other cultures, uh, the out-of-doors and I remember when I was five or six she would take me by the hand and say, "Where would you like to	go	for a walk?" and I'd point and we'd	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
She'd still want to garden and things would be coming up and she would think it was time to pull them out. [SEP] You'd have to kind of	go	behind her and say, "Whoa" .	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Well, my grandmother Tina, who was a little girl,	go	t sick with some fever, and her mother was staying up with her night and day and was just exhausted.

Uh, so then we, then you	go	through all these passage ways and you come into this, um, this long stretch where all of a sudden it's this like this big long cave and it's all, there's stuff all around the walls and there are, uh, and there are all these little tiny action figures little dolls and so on jumping up and making faces and all that kind of stuff, and singing and the music is, uh .	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Cattaraugus County, which is the next county down from Erie County, which is where Buffalo is.

We both like skiing and went skiing, "Let's ski this stuff," and in a little while we went, "Yeah, you can probably see what's coming here." [SEP] Uh, I didn't	go	over the edge by the way. [SEP] So we both started skiing, and we're pretty	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
We were jumping up and down and pretending we were parallel skiing back and forth and leaping up in the air in big clouds of dust, and it was really fun, and Andy finally quit. [SEP] He	go	t tired and I thought I'd	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

ust because they, uh, were so miserable that Christmas because my brother had been so sick. [SEP] Um, another time, this was for the, um, other brother, um, the one that had been sick as a baby, they bought him, one year, all this um cowboy and Indian stuff, and again all this assembly was required, and, um, the same friends that had helped put together all the boxes a few years earlier for my other brother, um, had come over and they had to put all these decals and stickers on everything and then had to individually dress all the different Indians, and, um cowboys and you know the tiny guns and the little itty-bitty tiny holsters that they had to put around the waist of all the different cowboys, and, uh, then, you know, all the little, um, suits and headdresses and everything that had to	go	on all the little Indians and the horses and the saddles and all this kind of stuff. [SEP] And Dad said they were up till like four o'clock in the morning getting all this stuff put together and were just exhausted and about dead.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
He was an engineer, and he, um, had to travel around to lots of different mills and stuff, and so, um, everywhere he had been he just could not find this Barbie-head thing, you know, and it was just you know getting closer and closer to the time and he was starting to panic. [SEP] And so finally, you know, some little town that, you know, he had had to	go	to, um, he found one, um, in a store. [SEP] And so that was my big Christmas present well when I put makeup on her, um, it just wouldn't even rub off, I mean it was just like this, you know, permanent stuff that you couldn't even smudge off or wash off even with soap and water.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Um, and, um, I remember another time, um, being told about a time when the family was up in the mountains. [SEP] We had this place that we would	go	to and they called it our rock. [SEP] But it was near, um, on the way to Chimney Rock, I think, and it was just off the side of the road and, and where the river was and there was a great big old flat rock that sort of jutted out into the river and, um, we would	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

But in front of the rock on, you know, the other three sides of this big rock the river was very swift. [SEP] And I remember them telling me one time, um, that my youngest, well not youngest but the younger brother, the one in the middle, um, had just, you know, jumped off into this swift- moving river, and, um he was always quite the daredevil, and still is, even in his 40s, um but he just decided he wanted to	go	swimming in the deep water and he jumped off. [SEP] Well, you know, he immediately was swept down the river.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And we had	go	ne to, um, a store. [SEP] I don't know if it was like K-mart or something like that, you know, a big old, you know, store and I was with him it was just the two of us because my mom had insisted that I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

And, and how about living in the South? [SEP] Do you think that's actually, ah, I mean when, if when, you	go	back up North do people say, "Hey I can tell you're picking up some `y'alls' or something." [SEP] I have not heard that to the to the best of my knowledge I have never knowingly used the term "y'all."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
In fact my aunt who just died within the last month was living in the house that my grandmother and grandfather built when they first moved to Guelph very old wood-framed house on two lots and at the time this wasn't a big deal but now it is, there's about a hundred yards of, a hundred yard wide strip of forest behind the house and then behind that is a private country club, and a very nice one and so the land the land has become very valuable. [SEP] At the time obviously it wasn't a big deal to live on a	go	lf course and now it is, so that, that property is still in the family, um, as a kid my I used to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Right. [SEP] So it's, um, almost like you'll, you'll meet, ah, if you	go	to Guelph you'll meet someone will probably know a Jamieson there. [SEP] Yeah, yeah because some of, like my aunt who just died was a bookkeeper who worked at a lot of local businesses and was extremely gregarious, so I think she was probably on a first name basis with a awful lot of the people who shopped downtown or whoever went downtown she was she lived there all her life and just knew a lot of people and they sort of come out of that kind of, that Irish tradition like everybody's your friend, everybody's your neighbor and even people that, ah should be fairly casually, she'd greet those people by name and know a little bit about them, ah, and so yeah she's, ah, and my cousin, one of my cousins, has a couple of businesses in town and I think is relatively well-known is on some sort of c	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

Well, I worked as a police officer for the town of Matthews for about four and a half years until recently.

When I was three years old my family and I moved to Myrtle Beach, SC from Woonsocket, RI, and when I was younger, I guess about seven, eight, nine years old, every Christmas my family and I would	go	to visit our relatives in Woonsocket, and we usually left on the 22nd of December, and I remember it being a really long car ride 16 hours and my sister, my younger sister, who was four years younger than me, would often fight in the back seat, and when we	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

[SEP] Um, at the time, when I was a sophomore in college at Notre Dame I decided to	go	on Spring Break, which happened around late March, and I decided to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

Um, OK, well, so, do you think you'll ever want to travel, or, and if you do, where do you want to travel to? [SEP] I would like to	go	to Scotland I know, Scotland and Ireland, um, just because I think, the, I think the land's beautiful, I like the accent, and I just think it would be a neat place to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

Um, I remember Christmas, some Christmases with my dad, um, because, I remember one Christmas we	go	t every, we always	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
I think when we had our funnest times, I mean those times were fun, but we also when, when we were involved in youth and stuff like that we had fun then too, so we didn't-- Did you	go	to the beach with us? Fort Caswell, yeah--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

Yeah, well, um, I had, OK, Jennifer, I, it been like a couple days about a week or so and I hadn't had time to	go	up and see her and I spent a whole lot of time with her and her kids, this is before I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

um, I'm scared," so I'm like "OK Jennifer", and she made me a pallet at the end of her bed and we were we were asleep and I was almost asleep and all of the sudden we heard this noise and it sounded like it came from the bed, and Jennifer said, "Tabatha I hope that was you," and I said "no I was hoping that that was one of y'all," and she said, "No, it came from down there," and I said, "No, it came from up there". Well, she looked at the clock and she's like, "Tabatha, get up get up now and come in the living room," and we went in the living room and sh, and I'm like, "What Jennifer", you know I wanted to	go	to sleep, and um, she said, "Did you see what time it was?" [SEP] And I said, "No I didn't see what time it was," and she said, "It was 2:15," well at the time that meant nothing to me, but um, she explained to me and later we watched the Amityville Horrors, and then it really started making sense to me, and speaking of Amityville Horrors, my house	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Of course she, at the time, was living in Gastonia and really didn't know her way around Charlotte very much at all. [SEP] So we decided to	go	to Omega Sports, which is at the Arboretum. [SEP] We were at our tennis club, which is over near Quail Corners Shopping Center, it's really not all that terribly convenient.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So, we went back, played our match, and as has always been the case with Sally and I, or most of the time has been the case with Sally and I, we won this match. [SEP] After it was over, everyone wanted to	go	out and eat, but I couldn't because Jocelyn was at home. [SEP] And I said, "I can't, I really thought this was just a tennis match, I've	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

So, I went home, didn't hear anything for a while. [SEP] A couple of weeks later, Sally called and invited me to	go	to Jazz Fest uptown. [SEP] She explained a story about a group of people from work and I think maybe they'd even rented a van, um, and were making the rounds, I can't remember all the details of it, but she said, "and I thought maybe you'd want to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So we, once again, parted ways. [SEP] Several weeks later, after the other relationship had run its course and had been completely wound down, um, I invited Sally to	go	to a, um, I think 25th anniversary party with some, some people that I worked with. [SEP] Um, we ended up getting together that Friday night before, to meet some other friends of mine to kind of give her a baptism by fire.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
He said, "That's no problem. We'll	go	get it. Where do you work?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
He said, "We have a problem." [SEP] See he hates to	go	downtown. [SEP] So he put me in his car and we went to the nearest Omega Sports and bought me some shoes.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
That was impressive. [SEP] But we had a neat opportunity to talk in the car and we talked and laughed `cause we were both kind a nervous and kind of silly, and we	go	out to play tennis and we're still being silly and talking and laughing and playing against our	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Anyway we decided we weren't	go	ing to lose the match, so we settled down and we played and won and had a	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Actually, I was just looking for another excuse to call him. [SEP] So I picked up the phone about two weeks later and called him and told him that Jazz Charlotte was	go	ing on, nope it was called Jazz Fest, and that the company I worked for had a shuttle bus, which it did, and people signed up for it and you	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
But about six weeks later I get this phone call from someone asking for Chrissy Everett identifying himself as Jimmy Connors and it was, guess who? [SEP] And he said there was a party, an anniversary party for some people that he worked with and did I want to	go	, and he was sorry that he didn't get to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And all my life she constantly brought us back and forth from, um, France to, um, America, um, to visit my family there. [SEP] So I still am fluent in French and I am very thankful for that, um, because recently, when my grandmother came to visit, she has never had heart trouble, and, um, never had anything	go	wrong with her heart or anything, and one day, while she was here, which was, here recently her heart rate dropped real low, so we had to, um, rush her to the emergency room, and this was something very scary for her because she doesn't speak any English. [SEP] She speaks like one or two words of English, um, not to mention, she doesn't like to,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LuhrChantal.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Um, and when they say it rains, it pours because my mom, um, recently moved back in with me, but I don't know how long that will be, but, um, she did and she had been up one night from, she had	go	tten up one morning at like five o'clock in the morning. [SEP] By the time I had	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LuhrChantal.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
I haven't said anything about it because, you know, I know it's	go	ing take a few days, but she wants to do it all in one day, so she's still up at like 11:30 at night,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LuhrChantal.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
But, um, she, she would tell me about how, the kind of trouble they would get into, and, and how strict her parents were. [SEP] And if she, she would	go	to the store and buy them bread. [SEP] And one day she went to buy them bread and she came back with the incorrect change and so her dad	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ManserAlexis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And if she, she would	go	to the store and buy them bread. [SEP] And one day she went to buy them bread and she came back with the incorrect change and so her dad	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ManserAlexis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
He kept bugging her and bugging her and she just wouldn't let him mess with it, you know. [SEP] And so, he threatened, he said, "I'm	go	ing to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_McCloskeyKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So she ran over to the box and, um, when she saw the box she, uh, she saw that she had put the dog on backwards so its legs were facing two different directions. [SEP] And then, because she was trying to rush it, you know, trying to keep him alive, she said he would run on two feet, he would run around the whole yard, whole yard and as soon as he would get tired he would jump, do a flip, and	go	on the other two feet and just keep on running. [SEP] That's pretty funny.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_McCloskeyKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
The other guy didn't even get to touch the ball. [SEP] So, but, um, my grandmother had 10 siblings and, um, she used to tell me when they were little there used to be a creek over by their house, and, um, she used to run, they used to get vines off the tree and just, they would swing on them, and like every week some kid, just being stupid, would break their arm or break their leg, break fingers or something and	go	crying home. [SEP] And the parents are just, they would never show them, they would always have the perfect swing but they would always point to a bad one and they would just cut them down and just have it, and everybody would just keep breaking their arms and stuff and, um, I don't know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_McCloskeyKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And Bebe Parker was a boy that, um,	go	t sucked into a drainage pipe one, one day and, um, he died. [SEP] And, uh, every year I'd	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_McCloskeyKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And I was so amazed because I thought it was the coolest thing. [SEP] And we used to	go	snipe hunting when we would	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_McCloskeyKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And, ah, anyway, she, she decide, she said that she was, that she made this decision that she was	go	ing to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So, uh, but anyway, Deirdre was really, she, she, she was a, she really believed that that's what she wanted and that was what she should do. [SEP] And, uh, as I	go	along, I'll, I'll talk a little bit more about, you know, my, my family's interpretation of this whole thing because that's part of what when I, when I think of Deirdre and I think of the loss of Deirdre, some of what I try to come to terms with is why, why my family interpreted her choice the way they did. [SEP] But, um, because the, the general consensus was that she was too scared or somehow felt insecure and she couldn't be a part of the world they never, they never said, "Oh, she, she did this because this is what she believes."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
You know, it was simply that, "Oh, she doesn't know what she's doing, and she's misguided, and she's scared," that was the general consensus. [SEP] Anyway, she became a nun, and, um, I would	go	and visit her. [SEP] And, um, she was, she became, she was a teaching nun, she taught in a school, um, Marymount was the name of the, uh, of the convent and, and the school, and they had a, a school in Tarrytown but they also had a school in Manhattan.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
She ultimately ended up teaching art, because she was a very, very gifted artist, um, at Marymount. [SEP] And when I would	go	over, first she was at Tarrytown, initially, and I would	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And then, she, she was, she, she was, because she was convalescing, they, she stayed in New York, they, they didn't send her overseas again. [SEP] And she, she was teaching at Marymount and I would	go	in and visit her. [SEP] And, um, she, she was also taking classes at the Art Students' League, and I was taking classes at the Art Students' League, so we would pass in the halls, and she would show me what she was doing, and, um, and as I say, she was a very gifted artist, and she loved teaching and again, she still seemed very, you know I never	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
that maybe she had made wrong choices, but, um, she never expressed that. [SEP] At some point this was, right about the time of Vatican II, because she started to wear different clothes, and it was, it was very, um, it was very discreet, I mean, she didn't suddenly just	go	out to Bloomingdale's and buy a whole lot of, you know, fashionable clothes, but, when I would	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

And, uh, my aunt at that time had, was diagnosed as having lung cancer and she was very sick. [SEP] So Deirdre took, was, took a leave from the convent, she was given, um, permission, to, um, for temporary leave, and I don't know logistically how that works, but she was, she was allowed to	go	home and, and be with her mother, to help her, um,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And, um, at that point Deirdre made the decision, and her mother did die, and it was, it was all very traumatic, my father was very sick, he's a manic depressive, so we were	go	ing through all of that, and he was very upset with the medical profession for how they were treating my aunt, and this and that. [SEP] But anyway, Deirdre made the decision that she wasn't	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
you know, did you, did you feel more alive, making that choice, and actually dying, under those conditions?" [SEP] But I can't ask her, I can only just	go	on asking myself, sort of rhetorically, you know, When did you feel more real? And then you know, the question for my family is, "Why couldn't you accept her decision?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MevilleSusan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
I told Mama it was embarrassing for my friends to come by there, ride by there, there he was laying in the yard passed out. [SEP] So the next time he started to lay down in the yard Mama told him, she said, "Clayton, if I were you would not lay down in the yard and	go	to sleep." [SEP] He mumbled something or other and laid down in the yard and went to sleep.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillerFlora.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
He mumbled something or other and laid down in the yard and went to sleep. [SEP] She took him by his feet and we had steps to	go	up on the porch. [SEP] And pulled him up, his head	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillerFlora.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

They taught me what I ought to know. [SEP] To get the job right before I was to	go	for the interview they told me everything I suppose to know when I went in there I knew it. [SEP] That's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillerFlora.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

Miami, Florida was almost too much for six people in a car to be together for a 10-day period. [SEP] But coming home we stopped in New Orleans and my dad had been on a roller coaster in San Francisco and he thought it was such fun and so we went to Pontchartrain Beach in New Orleans and that was nearing the end of the vacation and he said he wanted my brother Fred and me to	go	for the experience, he thought it was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MottSara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

If somebody wanted to come in and, and purchase some type of hardware then I would get the nails, put them in a sack, and weigh them.

No big deal. [SEP] All right, my name is Sarah Murphy and I was born in Charlotte, NC, and my story is um, that my family has had a lake house for a very, very long time and, um, I've always been told that my great-grandfather and all of us, we have a tradition that usually every July 4th we	go	up there and we set off firecrackers and just kind of watch the neighbors and see their firecrackers. [SEP] And we just take a boat ride and do a cookout and all this.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MurphySarah.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So I've always been told that my great-grandfather, whom I've never met, one time was up at the lake and they were doing their traditional July 4th deal, um, and they were setting off the firecrackers and he accidentally just, I guess,	go	t some messed up firecrackers, or set them off too soon, or what not, but he was right there and they kind of blew his fingers off. [SEP] So that was really, and I've always been told that, and like I said, I've never met him or anything, but I was just kind of surprised that that happened and it taught me, I guess, to never	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MurphySarah.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So that was really, and I've always been told that, and like I said, I've never met him or anything, but I was just kind of surprised that that happened and it taught me, I guess, to never	go	near firecrackers. [SEP] I don't	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MurphySarah.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

I would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it, was a really big thing to	go	to the movie on Saturday mornings. [SEP] And one particular movie theater we went to, they would show serials every Saturday, which were a continued story.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you, um, wouldn't know what had taken place. [SEP] So we would	go	every Saturday morning. [SEP] And also at this theater, they gave prizes to different people.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And one of the way they gave prizes was, they would take big group photos and everybody, and there were stairs	go	ing up to a balcony, real wide stairs. [SEP] And the big group of people would	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And the big group of people would	go	stand on the stairs and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture. [SEP] And they'd take the picture and then you would	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And another, um, that was in, that was in High Point, NC.

And one other form of refreshment that we	go	t, which really embarrassed my mother because she didn't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday, there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre.

But in my mind I can remember playing that, like all day long. [SEP] And we would	go	over to my grandparents' and they had a a big white house with a big front porch and, uh, banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch. [SEP] And it was just a great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or, uh, it could be a castle; just do many things with it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Everybody had their own "best" friend but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together. [SEP] Um, and we would, had that many girls but we would only	go	out in a couple of cars and I remember one of the girls, Betty Belle, her dad had a VW Beetle, and we'd fit like 5 girls in that VW Beetle.

We were used to, um, probably some smaller parks and, and, and larger parks, regional parks and state parks.

so I was a pretty lazy child when it came down to cleaning up and cooking. [SEP] So one night my mother asked me to	go	inside and wash the dishes. [SEP] Naturally, I start crying, and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me, either my stomach, or that I had a headache, or something was wrong with my leg.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

I was really afraid. [SEP] But he told me to	go	ahead and try it, so I took the entrance test, and they accepted me into at the school, and I took some courses there.

Well I didn't like writing at the time but I took it upon myself to	go	ahead and write a paper. [SEP] And I went to, um, one of my staff members and I asked her if she would proofread it, and she thought it was an excellent paper.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
I just	go	t to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never went back. [SEP] But I love what I do and, uh, anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

Um, when they were still remodeling the house, it was Christmastime, and we still lived in the city, the phone rang uh, whether it did or it didn't, my father said it did.

My father was in the hospital at the time, and he died a month later. [SEP] So my mother then left our home, and, uh, didn't have a home to	go	to, and built a home in the city, then, uh, was happy there, although she was lonely, I'm sure. [SEP] And, uh, created another garden, but was never the same thing.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
We walked down to the creek and the watercress was still growing in the creek as it had as I grew up. [SEP] Uh, it was interesting that the man was sensitive as we are, and he said that they would	go	to certain corners of the fields on the property that was sixty-seven acres and, you could still feel Mr. McGovern's presence. [SEP] And, uh, I liked that	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

Uh, went around with, not so much a chip on my shoulder, just, uh, an inferiority complex and didn't realize until I	go	t older that I was very much proud to be Japanese. [SEP] And uh,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Hum. [SEP] Did she ever	go	back to Japan? [SEP] She went back twice.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And we feel like travel is one of the best things you can give your children. [SEP] Money, clothes and all that can	go	away but travel is in your memories and that when I'm dead and	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
We would think "Oh yeah, right, you were rich." [SEP] And then when I did	go	over to Japan, I did see what she was talking about and really felt guilty that we didn't believe her, totally believe her, that, that she had all this, but um, according to Japanese standards, uh, they are just very wealthy. [SEP] And then they come here and they look at my house	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
It was. [SEP] I mean, to	go	from there to, wow-- She was pretty much treated like a princess, pretty much, I mean they catered to her family, they adopted children--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

kind of a long distance relationship! [SEP] And my, um, fraternity was having a cocktail and I, of course, needed someone to	go	with since I didn't have a, uh, girlfriend at the time.

[SEP] Did you ever remember him playing, was he a sports guy?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Not really, hmm, he grew up on a farm and, you know, playing sports was, um, and he was so much older that I was, he wasn't really in the best of health when I was growing up. [SEP] Um, of course, we would	go	up there every Sunday for Sunday lunch and, uh, he would get out in the yard with us and watch us climb trees and throw rocks and play, but he never really participated because he was 70 years older, you know, 70 years older than I was. [SEP] So your grandpa was fairly old when you were born?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
And she used to demonstrate that for me, too. [SEP] We would	go	out and we would play horse and she would kick my butt because she had that hook shot that nobody else could do! [SEP] In her high heel shoes!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Um, so, uh, but what, but actually, my move was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me, oddly enough, um, because when I moved, um, I met like, you know, close friends that, actually, now I	go	to college with and who I was a roommate with for a year or so. [SEP] Um, so even though it was kind of a scary experience being uprooted from everything you knew, um, it gave me the chance to see that change is	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Absolutely! [SEP] I wouldn't trade that experience for the world because there are too many people that I know who are very sheltered from not only new experiences, from like new ideas and new situations, and so I think it's kind of a blessing that I had the chance to	go	through this in the kind of, um, be the new kid and see what it was like to be the outsider and to not be in the in crowd, you know. [SEP] Because, I mean, I think a lot of people who have never been on the outside don't understand what it's like to be kind of the kid that's, you know, not "Mr. Popularity," you know?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
Not really because I was, I think I was too young when they told me that, I don't exactly remember. [SEP] But, like my mother's mother, my grandmother she like told us about how when she was very young and her mother die, so she had to	go	and work and help her family. [SEP] And from when you were little do you remember somebody telling stories, other stories?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaCaroline.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
before we went to bed. [SEP] But if it was, like too late already well, we didn't listen to them, we couldn't, she didn't tell them to us, because we had to	go	to bed, but whenever she had time she would tell us.

that's true	go	ing back full-time i think is is the way to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
i'd recommend that if if someone was trying to choose a college that they they get uh as much information on the schools as they can as far as what curriculums they offer and uh how reputable they are and what kind of reputation they have in the country and uh	go	from there the rest of it's just personal preference whether you like the mascot or not or whether it's close by	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah that was a	go	od thing to look out for i looked into	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
right i know a lot of people that did most couldn't afford to to	go	to a movie yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2153-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

yeah and then if things deteriorate they can	go	to a second level which is you know like where they prepare their meals for them and and they still live somewhat independently but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals and then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level which is full care	#telephone#	telephone_sw2155-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities and they wish to get the same thing they say why can't we have the same things that these other people have and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs and what we have to do is we have to	go	there get some stuff steal it and then you know  resell it it's easy you said the magic word there drugs	#telephone#	telephone_sw2160-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
it doesn't have to do i mean the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere right and like let's say you're you you	go	you know you're driving out and you're driving back home and it's late at night and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2160-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

right now if things	go	the way that that that they are there i think that they'll keep voting but i think they'll wind up like us at some point where people sort of only half of them will end up voting and sort of caring enough to really make a statement so	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
i've had one idea that i think is is is completely undoable but it but i think it but but i suspect it would work and the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate who you never expect to win to	go	out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements so that a large population of of of voters will	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
oh anti women statements anti Semitic statements anti black statements et cetera et cetera well then i suspect a lot of people would	go	out and choose a candidate to vote for just just to spite that person but i suspect that that that would actually never work	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

and then one her last sister died and it was probably seven or eight months after that she had to	go	in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was and plus she was driving my father crazy she went through three housekeepers live-in housekeepers so she's kind of cranky to get along with there's nothing physically wrong with her except she's very very old	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

so the the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it's a really trying job i mean i	go	up twice a week to see my grandmother and i know the staff very well so they couldn't they can't hide anything on you or anything like that but i have heard of really awful conditions uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
that there's	go	od people in the homes but it's just as it doesn't matter if it is like you say the best place they still don't want to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
when my father when something if anything happens to him i don't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i don't really want to	go	and visit him at a nursing home and hopefully that he he can uh get along with uh in-house help so he he's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
in-house help so he he's	go	ing to probably hopefully set it up so that he will uh be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day because i think that's the best situation is when you're you get that old and you've been independent your whole life you don't want to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

yeah but when they	go	into the homes they lose weight and like because of the institutional food you know i think it's fine but you know my taste um buds are pretty uh flexible and here they are they're always used to these	#telephone#	telephone_sw2308-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
the judge decides whether or not they should hear it yeah uh it it it's kind of difficult and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people	go	free than to put an innocent person in in jail right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2309-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them and sure they should have them	go	out and doing stuff cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state since the state is paying for them they should get some kind of kind of work out of them yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2309-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

well what do you think though um um i don't know i the the one problem i guess i have and maybe why so many women younger women now are choosing to	go	outside is i feel that in general in this society that being at home is not looked upon as um a job in itself whereas you know you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself but i know when i was working	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
uh-huh they used to look down on women that were home they'd say oh i bet you	go	home and you know at least you get out of here at three and you can	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
hum um and i think that one reason that so many younger women feel in uh compelled to	go	into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home and yet by the same token i think some of it is jealousy you you once in a while you hear them say things like i wish i had the choice you know i wish i was the one i would stay home with my kids if my wife would	go	out and support us uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

um he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility um if that meant you know for me to be able to uh uh advance or	go	back to work or whatever i'm kind of more  thank you  i'm kind of more middle of the road i think that when children are small i think it's okay for women to work especially there should be some a lot more part time	#telephone#	telephone_sw2347-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
it you know it's worked pretty well i haven't really	go	tten into any major problems without having something formal yeah how about how about uh long term do you have anything uh for as far as as far as savings	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um but this other it's in the credit union and they and they take it out and it	go	es in there and at the end of the month but if we want to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah or if we	go	out for dinner say to a nice restaurant um that'll come out of that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
rather than put it on a credit card oh that's sort of the way we you know do it or at least certainly for some of those bigger things or maybe one of the appliances breaks down you know and we have to	go	get something new then we've	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah so it you don't have to really dig into long term or or you know well you can't cash in a CD that's kind of ridiculous um yeah no i never	go	like to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2348-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

yeah in their own community right yeah and not to have to pull up roots and you know and	go	somewhere half way around the world or something yeah that's true  most of them probably wouldn't do something like that although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents	#telephone#	telephone_sw2349-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

yeah and they'll just	go	out and do anything they can to do it yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2378-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
right and i'm not sure what what to do about that or which way it's	go	ing to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2378-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and i'm not sure what what to do about that or which way it's	go	ing to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2378-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
well in the back of their mind if they know they're	go	ing to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2378-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
right right because you know a lot of countries just shoot you on the spot you know forget that trial and the jury and all that you know they just yeah i yeah i wouldn't want to see it	go	that far you know give them due process and then and then let them	#telephone#	telephone_sw2378-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
that's right uh mean i mean they	go	out there just just for the sake of of harming somebody right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2378-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um you know i don't even know if they are worth rehabilitating if if uh they	go	out and commit some of these violent crimes so but i don't know what the answer is we'll just have to i guess each each person will just have to try to do their part and	#telephone#	telephone_sw2378-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
well let's see well we assume i was an adult twenty years a	go	um well you're you're able to you're able to uh vote and	#telephone#	telephone_sw2379-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
well you're you're able to you're able to uh vote and	go	to war and things like that so uh yeah definitely able to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2379-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
do you and although we don't have any criminal actions here we do have other um lawsuits that do	go	to trial from time to time uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2380-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
uh-huh and uh when was it a couple weeks a	go	i was asked to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2380-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and uh we were split uh ten to two so it was uh a	go	od thing that  it wasn't a total waste of time to have a hung jury on a case that trivial yeah well um i've never fully served i mean i've been asked twice to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2380-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
uh-huh and that you're very much right but the jury may or may not see it that way so you get a little anticipate you know anxious there and	go	well you know sure	#telephone#	telephone_sw2380-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah well you know i don't feel that sure and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes you know the juries come down with a result and you	go	gee yeah i was a witness in a case in a criminal case and it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much evidence was excluded	#telephone#	telephone_sw2380-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
so we do have some problems and it seems to me that uh maybe it's time to just scrap all the case law and	go	back to general principles and start over and then make a legal system that carefully protects people but uh where	#telephone#	telephone_sw2380-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and then make a legal system that carefully protects people but uh where yeah i'd even	go	for for trying to get some truth out of the witness stand if they come up with some pretty reliable uh lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the truth	#telephone#	telephone_sw2380-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
right yeah allow them to uh	go	back and and deliberate and uh you know after each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like the next day bring those people back or if they would allow them to uh give broader answers they it's really kind of uh choreographed it's like a script has been written when people testify they aren't testifying really in their own words	#telephone#	telephone_sw2380-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

and decided that there was enough evidence and then okay uh well well what they do is on a criminal indictment first they	go	to the grand jury okay the grand jury will either indite or not once a person is indicted then they generally have an evidentiary hearing um	#telephone#	telephone_sw2481-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
say how long did the other trial	go	do you know huh-uh i don't know and like you said maybe it was just with the judge i don't know	#telephone#	telephone_sw2481-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

	go	hunting or	#telephone#	telephone_sw2482-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and the and yeah well if my dad had done that when i was a kid i probably wouldn't have liked it i	go	now with my husband and i enjoy it but	#telephone#	telephone_sw2482-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
they they're always wanting to	go	on a diet or something or or something yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2482-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
they're always wanting to	go	on a diet or something or or something yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2482-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um-hum to	go	do um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2482-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
i mean what we were talking about how much it cost to	go	to Disney Land uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2482-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
huh they were really in a mess and there were children involved and it was just terrible but i didn't think anybody you know they all deserved to	go	to jail not just the one guy you know uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2484-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um to the first to to kidnapping and so we went through the second part of the trial because in Texas there are two parts first of all to find if they are guilty or innocent he already said he's guilty so then then we	go	through the trial to determine what uh punishment should be meted out oh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2484-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah to decide which day to take off and you know do you take off the day before you	go	oh that would be tough after you	#telephone#	telephone_sw2484-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
before you	go	oh that would be tough after you	#telephone#	telephone_sw2484-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
it's it's it's so easy anyway for everybody to just kind of become a yes man and get carried up along with the emotions and so if there's somebody who's strong enough to stand up with a specific doubt i would a whole lot rather	go	through the expense of another trial because of a hung jury than that a justice not be meted out correctly yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2484-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
uh wanted to find him guilty because he kept saying he did it then we kept saying he did it but the other guy you know yeah we had to convince him that um you know that yes he did it but he wasn't guilty he didn't need to	go	to jail for doing it that was you know he did it he admitted it that he bit that guys finger but he did it in self defense so you know we just didn't feel that he needed yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2484-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
oh you mean so oh i see so everybody could stay together yeah a house or something right it's like a they have like a a convention type thing and then it has little rooms off of it where you know you'd	go	and sleep at night time but then it has like a kitchenette and things like that but you uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2485-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
oh see that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together than if you all were in your own hotels or something and then every time you wanted to	go	eat right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2485-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and another with somebody you'd probably have to	go	to out eat or something it would run into a lot of money so yeah but they had that was you know that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2485-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
that'd be great that'd be really nice yeah but that's uh you know that's the best way i found because whenever you have something where you	go	and now we had one yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2485-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
uh-huh thing where you could everybody could come and meet and	go	out to eat um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2485-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
so i i mean i couldn't give an accurate i couldn't tell my kids what you know those people were like i just remember they have some funny stories but i don't know who it was maybe what you could do if you couldn't get into a full family reunion and you wanted to	go	back some but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2485-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
right and so i think uh uh of course now i	go	the other extreme i do not like to see in the corporate areas uh all the women dressed like men uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2486-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
right uh-huh i think that you you make of that what you wish and you can	go	the opposite direction and uh overdo all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which don't belong in the uh at least in my opinion in the workplace uh but that that you can have a classical look without a lot of a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine because that was one thing i always fought against i started out as a physical education teacher	#telephone#	telephone_sw2486-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and uh and i find even even at home here now i i will wear blue jeans or i'll wear shorts and what have you uh and be very comfortable but when i	go	out somewhere then uh unless i have a pair of dress slacks i don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2486-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
exactly and there there's such a range of prices prices in the car market that if you don't start by narrowing it down by that factor i mean that really gets you into just one little slot and then there are many many options to	go	to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2487-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

places that you went before spur of the moment that might be nice but casual um sometimes it's not worth it to	go	through the trouble of digging the sitters and everything just to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
right when we do	go	out uh as you said you out on the town now when we	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um-hum you don't want to just uh necessarily run out for you know a one hour and come back i noticed with us it's more when we do	go	out then we do try to make it something nice maybe a dinner theater or nice restaurant with friends um sometimes lunches when we can do that that's okay too but	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um sometimes lunches when we can do that that's okay too but um it definitely you know it definitely changes is changed we maybe eat in somewhat nicer places now but that's because when we do	go	right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um and what i'm finding now is they're finally getting to the age where we're venturing into	go	ing again with them and of course when you take them though you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
i i i tend to agree with you too we look for more um uh quiet type more of a subdued atmosphere now and i think part of that is after you have kids you're you're not as interested in	go	ing to uh Georgetown type places where you know you	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yelling and uh you know you look for different things and that crowd seems to change and you know you're not as much part of it um and you don't there are more decent restaurants moving out to the suburbs you know and that type of thing uh you don't necessarily have to	go	downtown DC to to find decent restaurants and uh there's a lot that are moderately priced also whether you're in the suburbs or	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um and you don't there are more decent restaurants moving out to the suburbs you know and that type of thing uh you don't necessarily have to	go	downtown DC to to find decent restaurants and uh there's a lot that are moderately priced also whether you're in the suburbs or	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um some of the commercial um uh places have not caught up with the population here and so we do have a problem of the the half decent restaurants when you	go	on a Friday or Saturday night you're looking for quite a long wait hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and um not all of them do take reservations either so so you sometimes have to allot yourself uh enough time um you know to	go	out uh you can't figure on	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
that's one thing to definitely consider uh-huh uh-huh i think uh a lot of a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college a lot of the students that i talked to even here in Waco they	go	to Baylor um they or they're considering	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
no no is because of the fifty thousand students and i have to tell them that just like just Waco like i live in Waco it's a large city i can still function in my own kind of area in my own group i have a job i have my friends and i'm really not as as concerned about the entire city so when you	go	to a big uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and i realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from here and i've lived in other states and done other things for the past twenty years where i	go	to church now there are five other people that went to school at the same time in the same class as i and it it's neat to know that we have that contact that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

so there's a lot of factors involved what is the point at which you would	go	from home care to institutional care well i think i would in some ways have to decide how much personally you know i was able and willing to handle and how much it would affect you know the rest of my family because i have two small children	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and um we don't have a real large house if you had a lot of money and you were able to you know have like a little separate wing or something where i wouldn't have to constantly be having my children you know be quiet and	go	away and that kind of thing to accommodate an elderly person uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um the only people i've seen is my husband's grandmother has been in a nursing home for several years i know that uh there's been a lot of questions from other family members as to whether she's getting enough attention and whether they just kind of let her sit there and roll her over once in a while it it's really tragic to	go	in those places yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
the things i brought up you know that i thought were important for my family member it it would really be hard because when we	go	to visit i'm sure places have you know their best foot forward kind of thing unless you drop in frequently and kind of get the since of what's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
so i think that would be great if if you know if i had to choose a place for myself that's definitely why i think that kind of atmosphere would be wonderful even i recall where i was living in the college dormitory as a graduate student i thought how how neat you know that you can have a place where you can you know	go	down together and have dinner with other people because if your living alone the isolation and the depression and all those other factors should be taken into consideration too so i thought you know they should have dorms for older people they had activities	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
setting you know from what i've seen with my grandmother grandmother who passed i don't know maybe ten or twelve years a	go	they had her in a setting like that where she was responsible to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2817-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and uh she was paid very well because they the parents trusted them and they you know had done such a	go	od job so um i can see where someone you know in a position like that in a live in capacity would definitely be the way to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2818-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

oh they allow you that free time to do that but  yeah and that's you know there are people down there all the time you could almost hold meetings sometimes because people tend to set up a regular schedule and	go	down there uh but the the etiquette of the place is that you don't really talk too much business oh i really wouldn't have thought they'd give you that much free time this is part of your day	#telephone#	telephone_sw4555-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and it's not like i'm taking time away from the company i probably put in extra hours because i'm now physically fit and reenergized i mean that  my routine around two two thirty to	go	down there for an hour probably makes the last three hours of the day then more productive than i would if i  you know just sort of went on through so	#telephone#	telephone_sw4555-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

um-hum and there's i mean there's nothing you can just	go	buy one and take it home and you know it's easier than getting uh like a video membership card at you know a video store yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
i i see now i know they were having a gun show uh about a month a	go	and i was just wondering how that did work if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show uh yeah yeah you just	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
no well except for the the pistols and i i'm not sure how they do that i know they used yeah i was just curious you know because uh i know at at the regular gun show you know gun shop that you that you do have to wait for pistols like a couple of weeks and then they check you out then they call you up and you have	go	pick it up um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah yeah i'm not sure i'm not really sure but what uh the the gun laws in uh Pennsylvania Pennsylvania are like um-hum  no  we don't have guns because we don't	go	hunting or anything like that but like i say my son he's no	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um-hum but he's always he went to the to the school to learn how to shoot it he	go	es to the pistol range and uh and the rifle range to shoot them he likes to	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah right right and so you know they they would just all the profits would	go	to you know now i do believe though like in California if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has i think they're liable now for it	#telephone#	telephone_sw4726-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and so they just fit in there when they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work but right now i can right now i can throw them all in the back when we have room and uh there you	go	and since i do a lot of projects i throw things in the back and i kind of like having a pickup truck actually i think of it as a  as a car that'll last	#telephone#	telephone_sw4728-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
let somebody else break it in right right and uh the van we're sort sort of we might	go	again on a on a van uh we we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time i'm not sure yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4728-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
i'm sure he does yeah yeah so you know you how when was the last time you took out took your truck out just to just to	go	driving yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4728-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
no and i	go	out twice a week on the bike so at least just for the enjoyment yeah it's like	#telephone#	telephone_sw4728-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um i don't know about you but uh i work outside the home and uh in fact uh i'll be leaving very shortly to	go	to work and i work different shifts so are pretty much a a later shift to where i don't have the family time uh when my husband gets home it's usually he's home with my daughter alone and then uh couple of hours later i'm home	#telephone#	telephone_sw4745-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
sure exactly and i also notice that the children that come over here to play that	go	to day care every day um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4745-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and i'm finding as i volunteer up at the school i just a being um i'm not educated at all in um really detecting this but i can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty	go	od basis after i've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids	#telephone#	telephone_sw4745-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um-hum not that the kids that	go	out aren't getting that it's just a different they're they are more used to being with their own age kids they're not use to being with adults and to responding to adults yeah yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4745-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
uh like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties uh were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision well jeez you know i'll	go	out and get a part time job	#telephone#	telephone_sw4745-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
right and you have to make that decision to	go	back to work part time or	#telephone#	telephone_sw4745-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
oh really so probably i'll	go	ahead and break down and you know i guess i guess from the school  this is just not professional you know  so i'm kind of a hold out	#telephone#	telephone_sw4746-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and the dashboard just looked	go	od to me it was just no nonsense had the the speedometer uh speedometer and the tach and the couple of other little gauges like engine heat but none of the you know big flashy electronic stuff yeah i i've continually i've come to learn in having this car that it was fully loaded when we	#telephone#	telephone_sw4749-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
apparently was a problem year for them because they you know what's happened is most people have just	go	tten rid of them as soon as you know they pass the three year mark and things start	#telephone#	telephone_sw4749-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and that's what kills cars up here is you know the salt rusts them out and then they die years before you you know a car from California might be undrivable right or or they they die of rust years before their major systems would otherwise	go	out yeah that's that's what happened basically to our last car i mean it just this rust took over and	#telephone#	telephone_sw4749-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah i think i think uh it's uh seems to be that i don't know some people they tend they do something you know they shoot somebody or whatever they	go	to jail sentenced to jail for like thirty years they're out in five and they're back on the street and then they shoot someone else and just cyclical cyclical cyclical and it seems seems as though the the system doesn't  tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done	#telephone#	telephone_sw4752-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
it's just that too many people argue about how to fix it yeah i know when i lived in Oakland it was just that uh like i definitely wouldn't	go	into certain areas of of the city by myself oh sure	#telephone#	telephone_sw4752-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
oh sure and uh and then then again some areas i wouldn't	go	by myself after dark right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4752-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
but down here in Patterson well like i say it's so small that you can	go	anywhere yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4752-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
think is wrong with the public school system is that i think we've lately in the last twenty years or so kind of lost focus with the basics uh in order to	go	into this sort of specialized curriculum where uh we're teaching kids not a broad base of subjects but rather trying to concentrate them on particular subject areas that they think they might be interested in	#telephone#	telephone_sw4756-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and i think you know it's those kinds of things that i i'm not sure how we	go	about fixing something like that other than maybe devoting some more uh uh resources into first of all getting uh the uh teachers reasonable salaries and uh expecting in return some sort of standard	#telephone#	telephone_sw4756-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
which i've never liked very much but she seems to yeah i don't i if i you know if if i happen to find it i'll	go	ahead and read it someplace you know if i'm in a doctor's office or something like that but other than that i never i never liked that really do you read a newspaper	#telephone#	telephone_sw4758-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
it gives you a different perspective on what people do um-hum um-hum well those travel magazines are that more or less show you different countries that you could	go	to or yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4758-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
why don't you	go	ahead with the fishing part well uh i mostly do i fish for uh bass	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
i'd rather have the blue gills the sunnies the crappies the perch um to me they're better tasting so i always seem to	go	fishing for the smaller um smaller fish versus the big fish	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
but um when i was growing up my father kind of introduced me to fly fishing and that was kind of a very interesting uh experience that i had and i'm sure that part of me would like to	go	back and do that it's kind of like for trout fishing um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
the most if i	go	fishing it's basically with the worm at the end of the hook and i you know try to catch the small fish it's it's not for the big try to try to get the biggie so yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah i use a fly  quite a bit uh when i	go	bass fishing um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah i had a chance to	go	to uh Alaska for six weeks last summer and did some salmon fishing up there and that was really uh oh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um-hum but it seems like if you	go	fishing like in the middle of the summer when it's hot and humid uh the fish tastes  tastes fishy versus um when the water it's just opened up from the ice and the water temperature is extremely cold	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um-hum it's almost the better tasting fish are either ice fishing uh when you	go	ice fishing or when uh you know you	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
it's almost the better tasting fish are either ice fishing uh when you	go	ice fishing or when uh you know you	#telephone#	telephone_sw4761-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and and i i feel as though uh that uh uh you know that if you you are a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really	go	into a deep background of course we're  being involved in my organization uh we we have deep background checks and sure sure	#telephone#	telephone_sw4765-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um but i guess i feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business um and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that uh things like drug laws seem to come and	go	you know we had prohibition for awhile and then we didn't have prohibition	#telephone#	telephone_sw4765-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
well but you	go	t to look at prohibition though you had the same problems there right uh that that people	#telephone#	telephone_sw4765-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
well i i do believe there are people that are truly concerned about um society and making a better a better world and	go	in it um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4769-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
it really if you	go	to to uh to solve root problems they take a while um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4769-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
absolutely and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to	go	i mean yeah that's what's in you know Los Angeles is i think that's biggest problem because when i was in Los Angeles for a time it's all you know from Los Angeles to San Die	#telephone#	telephone_sw4771-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
so it's just like i don't know i i guess i guess i'd have to	go	with uh i i i'd be for it uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4774-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
you know i i i don't know it's just kind of a kind of a delicate subject i guess but i i i would i would probably	go	for for	#telephone#	telephone_sw4774-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
but uh i voted with my feet and uh my kids	go	to parochial school uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4784-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

um no we've had them out in uh kind of wilderness uh areas before we	go	camping so you	#telephone#	telephone_sw4787-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
it's just when i was uh couple of years a	go	involved in some pretrial stuff and like you know you	#telephone#	telephone_sw4792-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

but um that friend of mine's telling me that i might have to	go	in for uh as a witness he may subpoena me so we'll see what happens	#telephone#	telephone_sw4792-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah yeah that's true and in fact they're even letting some	go	i'm i'm originally i'm originally from Florida and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just because they don't have room for them yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4792-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
uh-huh uh i suspect a lot of people uh uh	go	t uh turned on by watching watching those	#telephone#	telephone_sw4796-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
uh i'm not you know there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as uh you know with the space shuttle and all although plans to uh	go	to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to uh the sixties uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4796-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
the process itself gets so drug out and so you know i understand you need to prove without a shadow of a doubt that the guilt and whatnot but the appeal process of it i think is what really bugs me if you're	go	nna make it	#telephone#	telephone_sw4798-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
oh and then she had to	go	back in a couple of times but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up	#telephone#	telephone_sw4799-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
oh uh-huh and she loves that because it it they arrange activities for them all day long and then they have um where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to	go	um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4799-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
so does she have a is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to or she can	go	down to the cafeteria yeah it	#telephone#	telephone_sw4799-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
fact i because i i remember her in her letters telling me she she'll	go	downstairs for coffee or something to eat so i'm assuming it's something like that too so uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4799-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
so we haven't had to do anything but then again she has a lot of support so i mean she's	go	t her mother in town too and things like that so hopefully we won't need to	#telephone#	telephone_sw4799-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
well i i think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary you know a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's it's almost like that you know they say putting them out to pasture and some some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active they they wanted to do things they didn't you know they didn't wanna	go	down and play bin	#telephone#	telephone_sw4799-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

did the drug testing thing after that so uh it was one of those things where you	go	through the the general battery of all their tests and and then they essentially give you the offer uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4812-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

that's you know that's not always an option either right but you know if my family if all of my kids still live here and i	go	back to Iowa course there is no convenience so probably it would behoove me  to try to start something of this sort here in Dallas um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw4815-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
