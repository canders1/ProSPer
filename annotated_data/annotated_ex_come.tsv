ELAINE KORRY: Even communities that do try to reuse the base are finding they won't reap the full rewards for many years to come. Cleaning up the military's toxic waste and unexploded ammunition is turning out to be far more expensive than the Pentagon estimated. Even in the case of Fort Ord, which has been touted as a model of base conversion, local officials such as Jackie Lambert are having to scale back their expectations. JACKIE LAMBERT: Anyone who thinks they're going to	come	to this area in five or ten years and see a robust, bustling business community on Fort Ord I think is going to be somewhat disappointed, because it's going to take a lot longer than that.	think	speaker@UT	to this area		natural	COCA; 1996 (19960510); California Communities Grow Despite Base Closings; SPOK: NPR_Morning
So the FBI out of Milwaukee is investigating this guy, and they wait until he comes to the U.S. to visit an auto show in Las Vegas. And as soon as he crosses, you know, U.S. Passport Control - I believe he touched down on JFK on his way there - they know about it. They find out where he's staying. They call the FBI team in Las Vegas, and they arrest the guy in his hotel room. So he thinks he's	coming	to the U.S. for, like, this three-day, you know, car show, from Russia. He ends up, like, two days later sitting in a jail cell in Milwaukee, where he stays for more than a year.	think	speaker@UT	to the US		natural	COCA; 2013 (130820); Wild, Wild Web: Policing An Early, Lawless Internet; SPOK: Fresh Air 12:00 AM EST

Months ago he'd been invited to give a paper in the south. He had sworn many times never to return yet here he was again. Why he chose to visit the capital city first, and at this sensitive time, he couldn't say except that in part it was to see how his friends had fared through the troubles.

Keep calling. Please keep calling, Audubon thought, again and again, as they rode through the forest toward the sound. The birds-whatever they were-did keep up the noise, now quietly, now rising to an angry peak as if a couple of males were quarreling over a female, as males were likely to do in spring.

Yeah. Well, one of the most difficult things was one day up in Missouri, we were almost struck by lightning, and it actually picked Martin up and pushed him off to the side, the force of the lightning bolt. But the hardest thing that we did, I thought, was coming through the commercial traffic between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. I mean, it was an incredible amount. We had the tows, tugs, barges, the ocean freighters	coming	in. It's not something I would recommend for other people to experience.	think	theme	through the commercial traffic		natural	COCA; 2002 (20020909); Interview: David Hale discusses accompanying Slovenian swimmer Martin Strel as he swam the entire length of the Mississippi River; ROBERT SIEGEL; SPOK: NPR_ATC

SIMEONE: I've got to wonder why in heaven's name you ever left New Orleans. I mean, you're so blues influenced, and that would seem to be the perfect place to stay and to play. Mr-SMITHER: The fact is that almost every musician, every New Orleans musician that I know of who ever got anywhere had to leave town. And that goes all the way back to Louie Armstrong. Louis Armstrong had to leave New Orleans, and at one point, he thought he never would	come	back. But it was just a coincidental thing. I wanted to play acoustic blues and nobody in New Orleans in the' 60s wanted to hear that.	think	theme	back (to New Orleans)		natural	COCA; 2000 (20001111); Interview: Chris Smither discusses his musical style and his career; LISA SIMEONE; SPOK: NPR_ATCW
