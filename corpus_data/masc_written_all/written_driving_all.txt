Even if your life requires four wheels, you can use a bike for local errands. Ride it to the<n>corner store when you need milk, instead of driving across town to the grocery store.

Chassis<n>Antie will be implemented on a tiny Road Warrior robotic system. Behaviors will be coded in Interactive C, for which some pseudocode is included. Sensors will include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors. Antie be a circular robot, no more than 1cm in diameter (the length of a red harvester ant), with two driving wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization. A gripper will be located on the front of the robot consisting of two elongated tongs. Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors, sonar detectors and chemical emitters, including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging. These sacs will be refilled at a filling station each morning as Antie determines that they are getting depleted. Antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance. For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that Antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day. A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached.

I heard an automatic window roll down. “Hey,” said a male voice, “do you need some help?”<n>I turned around. The man looked over forty, and he was driving a car I’d be afraid to drive on this street. “It’s a long way to anywhere worth going,” he said. “Would you like some help?”<n>“Ah, I think I’m fine, thanks,” I told him, and turned back to the sidewalk.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
“I know your family. Get in. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and it’s best to start now.”<n>I walked around the car and got into the passenger seat. Before I had my belt on, we were rolling forward. “Okay,” I said. “I’m in the car. Now, will you tell me how you know my family, and how you happened to be driving by just now? In fact, why didn’t you call me by name the first time? And how did you recognize me when – ”<n>“That’s enough! I can only answer one question at a time. I know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours. I am here now because you called for help, and no-one else would answer.” He turned onto the next street and shifted up. “I will help you find your Rachel. I have to warn you, though, you won’t like what I have to tell you.”<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
My driver took a deep breath. As he did, his neck stretched in a strange way and I noticed several thin lines, like wrinkles, running across the sides of his neck. “Nathan,” he began in the way that people speak when they start a long and difficult explanation, “Rachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet. This person, like me, is not a member of traditional society. You see, Nathan, there is …separate from your society …oh, damn it. I’ve never had to give this conversation before. Come on, I have something to show you.” With that, he made a sharp turn onto a side street that I hadn’t noticed before. We drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that I couldn’t tell whether they were abandoned. My driver turned again next to an old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year.<n>In front of a few houses, there were cars parked, but there were almost none on the streets. Their bumpers looked ready to drop off, and their paint was half smog. I got a strange feeling that we weren’t supposed to be driving here. “Hey,” I said, “are you sure that we should be going this way? I mean – ”<n>“Just ignore that,” he told me. “You’ll be used to the sensation in a moment.” That just unnerved me more. As we kept driving, the anxiety grew more pronounced. I noticed that there were some people on the street, people the same color as the soiled buildings. Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes. “Okay, this is the spot,” said my driver, pulling over. He parked and got out.<n>	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt
