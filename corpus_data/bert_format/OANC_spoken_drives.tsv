[SEP] By the time I had got home from work, and so forth, it was like 11 o'clock at night and she was extremely tired, but my mom is one of these people who constantly has to go and do something, she can't sit still, it	drives	her crazy. [SEP] So she thinks she's going to make, you know, she moved all her stuff back in my house, and she thinks she's going to clean it up all in one day, so my house is like a tornado hit it by this time, but, you know, I'm fine.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LuhrChantal.txt	drive	spoken	OANC_spoken	4
