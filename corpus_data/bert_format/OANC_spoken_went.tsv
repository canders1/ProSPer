He dia, diagnosed me as having acute leukemia and um, this was when I lived back in Raleigh. [SEP] And uh, Momma and I took trips back and forth to Chapel Hill and	went	through a couple of treatments and uh, you know, uh, ( ) uh, I had, had to have different shots each time I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsElissa.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Um. [SEP] I guess I was in a wing of the hospital where five or six other children in that whole wing of the hospital, well, in that, that wing and everybody	went	through the same treatments. [SEP] Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsElissa.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
It's just one of those things, you know that happened. [SEP] And it was one afternoon I was out playing on the uh, sidewalk and uh Mom was, Mom was in the kitchen doing something and I was, I guess pretending to act like a salesman and I	went	up to the front door and rang the doorbell. [SEP] And Mom came to the door and uh, she saw like this glow of light all around me as if the Lord had definitely cured me of leukemia.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsElissa.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Nothing more. [SEP] Actually, I	went	back to see my doctor and when I, everything you know was fine. [SEP] Nothing, you know, nothing more to do.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsElissa.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I do enjoy reading the um, stories related to Guideposts or uh, what's another, Reader's Digest, they come in. [SEP] ( ) When cancer comes up I'm just pretty, pretty interested in it, to find out what they	went	through and I can relate to it. [SEP] Other than that, I get more out of reading Reader's Digest or Guide, Guideposts stories.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsElissa.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
That was the first time I saw them, the gue, the guerillas. [SEP] Then they	went	on, they didn't make it to the house. [SEP] At about, about three weeks later, then arrived a group of about four, at my brother's house, and told him, that they were coming to, to be, that is to take control of the place, where we lived.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
But if we didn't want to work with them, we shouldn't get them into anything with the mil, military, such as, informing on them, or something like that. [SEP] So, time	went	on. [SEP] Then when, well, since I lived alone, only with my son, they, would seek me out because, I always had, everything, because I had all kinds of animals, including doves from Castile, uh, turkeys, ducks, hens, pigs, cows, all kinds of animals.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And that's how, I kept on, working and, with them. [SEP] They there, well, they'd come from time to time to buy things, until one day, well, they already had been there for several years, when, all of a sudden along came a young fellow who	went	around with them whose name was Jose, they call him "Chepon" because he was tall, white, and all. [SEP] So, he, he came looking for, yogurt, I don't know what he came looking for, for me to sell him.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I said, "No, I'm not going to tell them." [SEP] So, the next day, I left early in the morning for San Miguel, to see my daughter, and when I was coming back, I	went	by my brother's, which was a place in, a town called Chapeltique, and I arrived at his place, and I said, his name is Salomon, and I said, "Brother, I am here to see if you'll give me posada (lodging)," we call it, like you give someone a place to live in your own house. [SEP] And he said, "What's going on?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
"Yes," I says. [SEP] That same while that I was there at my brother's, we	went	to look for, the people who owned land, to see if they would give me, pasture land for the animals. [SEP] And, yes, they gave me some, and I left.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And, yes, they gave me some, and I left. [SEP] It was getting, I got there late, like at, six in the afternoon, I got home, and after I waited for it to get dark, I	went	to my neighbor's. [SEP] My neighbor had about four, five grown boys.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So he said, "OK, that's fine." [SEP] And, the same way I	went	out to another, er, e, cousin, his name is Cristobal, and I said, "Cristobal, do you have to, what are you doing tomorrow?" "Nothing," he said, "Why?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And that's the way it as, how I kept working there. [SEP] After I worked there, then, that, I	went	to, San Miguel, because my daughter, also, had, she needed me. [SEP] And, I kept on, and finally when I saw that life was really expensive, and I didn't have, I couldn't work anymore since I'm not a professional, then I decided to come (to the US), because also, well, the, there in that area, since now there wasn't anywhere to work, I had left hidden from the guerrillas, and, well, that's what I continued.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

[SEP] Well, and I forgot to tell you when the soldiers came, to my house, the guerrillas were there, the guerrillas	went	back. [SEP] They hid and, the soldiers came to the house.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
The next time the soldiers, came through, the guerrillas were in front of the house, in the road, there's one, of those huge rocks, that you can sit on, and when they were eating.

she said, "so I'm going." [SEP] So, I came in, from where I was washing, I	went	in, and I didn't see what the guerrillas did with themselves, because I didn't see, they were in front, but since I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And he said, "Ma'am," he said, "what did the guerrillas that were there eating do with themselves?" [SEP] I said, "Sir, I've gone in, and I don't know, the house is big, and I	went	inside," I told him, "I haven't seen anyone." [SEP] He says, "Look, ma'am," he says, "you deserve to have your tongue cut out, because you are covering for the guerrillas."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I said, "The fact, you, I, you can be there," I said, "or I can stay here and you go in," I said, "you don't see where I get off to." [SEP] Then they left, they left for the mountain, they	went	on up. [SEP] Then a huge throng of soldiers came, and they shot over the house, that, we have to, my dad always used to have a lot of, we call them cercos , of, of pure ijiote of, of, made of poles that are nice and fresh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Well, so many bullets, so many things. [SEP] Then, and the neighbors, and a niece of mine and a cousin lived there, and bullets	went	through my nephew's, and he had a five-year-old daughter, who was the only one who was there, because her mom, had gone to bring water, and she stayed, because of the firefight, she also stayed inside, so that she wouldn't, the little girl locked herself in, and thank God, she survived. [SEP] And when, then that was the first time that my little boy came down with, as if, I don't know, he didn't faint, but he, he turned purple here [indicates area around her mouth], green and then purple, and then he stopped breathing, fell to the floor.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

[SEP] So, then, I grabbed him, and when I grabbed him, I put him under the bed, and I	went	outside. [SEP] In, uh, in the window in front, we have a window facing the street, there was a guerrilla lying on the ground, firing at the soldiers.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
In, uh, in the window in front, we have a window facing the street, there was a guerrilla lying on the ground, firing at the soldiers.

One of the wife's brothers had come. [SEP] When, all of a sudden, at daybreak, my, my brother	went	to, to bring a, to the well close by there, two jugs of water, his wife and he, and I stayed in the house, making coffee.

So, they tool him away, we didn't see him anymore, they took him to San Miguel, I don't know, if in that vehicle, surely in the same car they were riding in, they took him to the hospital. [SEP] Then, we were left, and since they were still in front of the house, we	went	to a woman's home, who was a nurse, so when a big round of gunfire started, we covered ourselves up against the walls of the houses, we walked a little way, we threw ourselves against the other wall, until we could get there. [SEP] And when we got there, the woman said, "Go on in to the main house," and another house father inside.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So, we stayed there. [SEP] And then, well, we found out that my brother had been admitted, until they took out th, that (fragment0, they let him come, but now he didn't come, he	went	to, to the department of education and asked a transfer, they didn't deny it to him, they transferred him to another place immediately. [SEP] Then he came and we stayed on in the same place.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
They had a big firefight like that, and there was my bro, er, my brother-in-law was, he also died.

Do you think that's a good thing that it helped culture you, or-- Yeah, it did because I know people from Charlotte now that	went	to like, not to slam Providence because I like a lot of those people, but they like have like so many like stereotypes of people because they don't know anybody.

Uh, I remember hearing stories as a child when basically my mother reading stories to me, not so much my father, but more my mother when I was, I can't even tell you how old I was. [SEP] But I just, I know for a fact as a child my mother would read to me before I	went	to bed. [SEP] Do you remember any stories?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So, like, you remember specific events? [SEP] I remember general things, I remember one time, we were at the shore, my fam, my grandfather had a house in Stone Harbor and there was a hurricane and I remember, um, you know, we moved all the furniture inside for the hurri, hurricane and we	went	out and he had an awning over his porch and, you know, and we, we double-tied the awning down. [SEP] During the hurricane we'd go out and check to make sure that uh, uh, you know, all the strings were still tied and the awning wasn't going to blow away, but I don't remember, you now, I don't think we'd sit around and telling that story I mean, I occasionally mention that.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichDavid.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
But, I don't remember, we, we, don't generally sit around and swapping stories about it, I mean, we just last week we were at, the whole family again,	went	to this time a North Carolina beach. [SEP] My Mom rented a house there and we, you know, I think at that point just because, you know, being at the beach I remember things and I would say, "You remember when we used to do this or that and the other thing and?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichDavid.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Um. [SEP] It was just, you know, we just	went	on with our lives, but now, now as I am older she would tell me things that, you know, I never even knew about. [SEP] Lived with, we lived with the whole time, but I never even knew about, so, it was a little different.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichMegan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
He came, he opened the door and I remember looking back and seeing the expression on his face, and I could tell that he was disappointed. [SEP] He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't, I wasn't really sure if what I had done was really, really wrong I just knew that he wasn't very happy about what was going on by the way he opened the door and by the way he told me I needed to come into the house, and I, I came over there and I stepped up and I didn't even say, "Bye," to my friend and was probably not into that kind of thing I didn't really notice at that time probably I just	went	into the house. [SEP] And Dad said he had noticed, he had seen me throwing tomatoes in Mrs. Faulk's yard, so he told me that I was in trouble and I was going to get a spanking, and, um, I was kind of uh, uh looking for an out so I was smart enough to say, "Hey Dad!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I was probably, just laugh about anything. [SEP] I remember, some of my friends, I remember one time when I	went	to lunch, and I always had this Pac Man lunchbox, pull out this Pac Man lunchbox, and I would, that I was so proud of, and, you know, do my thing, and I would be talking so much and laughing about the stupidest things that I wouldn't even, I wouldn't even eat my lunch. [SEP] I would just laugh the whole time, and one time I did it so much that I never even opened my lunch out of the bag, and it was like a minute before, a minute before lunch was over and the teacher, the P.E. teacher came up to me, and he said, "Look, this is horrible, Thomas.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
This is just," you know, "Look you're in trouble. [SEP] You're not eating your lunch," come with him, so I	went	, he, I had to follow him and remember being really nervous and he sat me down a corner and he told me I had to sit there until I ate all my lunch, and I remember, um, crying for a long time and I think that basically what happened there was that was just an amazing mood swing because I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Um, um another memory with my family that I have is that we had a lot of weddings, ah, and these weddings were always really big weddings, and I've always been told the reason why they're so big is because basically it's Polish, you know. [SEP] Half of my family's Polish, so Polish, we have big weddings and I remember at my cousin's wedding I was like 12 years old going to it and I had a my cousin Tim and he was about 10, and, ah we	went	to this wedding and it has like 200 people. [SEP] My uncle, he's a great guy.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
My uncle, he's a great guy. [SEP] He's also really big into the Hell's Angels and he brought about 50 of his friends to it and the wedding took place in a hotel one of those classic areas where you have, you have the weddings, and it was, ah, basically a really stormy night, real stormy and the power	went	out, and it was open bar so now we've got, ah, 50 Hell's Angels, no power, and it's the middle a summer, so it is getting really hot in there, you know, there's, there's no lights so you know there's a few emergency power lights that people brought, ah, and they had some sort of battery they were using for the ah for the radio system and it was, it was getting really crazy in there because we had Hell's Angels running around without shirts on, uh, people highly intoxicated, I remember by 10 year old cousin saying, "Bottom's up, Thomas! Bottoms up!"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I was like, "OK, well that's good," you know, like that. [SEP] Well anyway, I	went	back to my, my desk. [SEP] I ate real quick, as fast as I could and then she came in there and she ended up helping me with it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And you know, they were a close family and they loved each other and all that kind of stuff, but it was just down the road, you know, so they said fine, and, and you, you know, he came back on Sundays and he was with the family at church and all that sort of thing. [SEP] Um, but, ah, one day he didn't show up, on Sunday, uh, for church and so they wondered what was going on and they	went	to this house, ah, down the road and the cousins had packed up and left. [SEP] They had just gone.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Of course they already had done the pilot's bit before they done, well, I had to go through altitude chambers myself because I was working with pressure suits. [SEP] I	went	to Fort Worth, TX to go through the altitude chambers with a partial pressure just like I was working with, and when, when all the training was done on the pressure suits and things, I was chosen with a sergeant secretary to go through a school, which, we was in a school about the size of a nice-size bathroom. [SEP] We would go in there.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
We would go in there. [SEP] The doors were locked when we	went	in.

So I would go back determined, determined to stay with it, and, of course, they trained two more after I had been through, but who did they use to set all the injections? [SEP] And it was myself and Secretary, the one who	went	through that school, that, you know, the two that we	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
OK, well, that's where I	went	. [SEP] They chose me over everybody else, and, of course Sergeant Secretary, he was a different AFC, but he's the one that	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Uh, of course, I won't go but we, I have just so much I could talk about, but, uh, that is the main things that we, of course, everybody knows now that the, what has happened. [SEP] Uh, Russia backed down and that's the good thing to do because if they did not and we	went	to nuclear war, I was trying to get my family out of Del Rio and back to NC, but it happened so fast I didn't get them back. [SEP] Because if their was a nuclear war then, or if there's nuclear bombs started missiles or anything, I would want the first one to hit me right between the running lights because this just would be a world after a nuclear war and--.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

I, I would say, your Mom and I were in our late thirties and you were um, um well anyway, it doesn't matter.

And we had a great time.

She was kind of confused of what background she wanted to u-, what ethnic background she wanted to use, so she decided to use her black heritage, um background. [SEP] And so she moved to New York and she	went	to school there, she made it through school and she did become a attorney. [SEP] She later was going through problems because they found out that she was a black ethnic and not white, so they would, she could no longer work with the firm.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HicksDebra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
She started the organization and I can't remember the name of the organization and, um, she helped out a lot of, of women that uh, that were black women that were having problems being able to make it in society because of their, their color or their culture background. [SEP] And, um, let's see she didn't she, her grandmother passed away and she, um, after her grandmother passed away, she moved from GA, her and her husband, she did have a child and, um, so she moved back to New York, and she, uh, after she finished helping with this, um, women organization, um, she	went	back into law practice.

So it's, um, almost like you'll, you'll meet, ah, if you go to Guelph you'll meet someone will probably know a Jamieson there. [SEP] Yeah, yeah because some of, like my aunt who just died was a bookkeeper who worked at a lot of local businesses and was extremely gregarious, so I think she was probably on a first name basis with a awful lot of the people who shopped downtown or whoever	went	downtown she was she lived there all her life and just knew a lot of people and they sort of come out of that kind of, that Irish tradition like everybody's your friend, everybody's your neighbor and even people that, ah should be fairly casually, she'd greet those people by name and know a little bit about them, ah, and so yeah she's, ah, and my cousin, one of my cousins, has a couple of businesses in town and I think is relatively well-known is on some sort of city board, or something like that. [SEP] Yeah the family is big enough and the city is small enough I think that you would run into a decent number of people who would know a Jamieson or two.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
It's August 12th of this year, August 12th of 2000, and, uh, don't know, don't know too many more details about it and don't know if I'll be able to go. [SEP] I	went	a couple of years ago and didn't make it last year and I'm, I'm, now I'm kind of sorry I didn't, because my aunt passed away in the meantime, and I knew she was in poor health last year. [SEP] Oh but there's just, um, just a couple of my dad's generation left.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
After we ate dinner we decided to go and play some games in the arcade. [SEP] The kids	went	bowling, shot basketball, and just ran around crazy. [SEP] It was getting late, but we decided that we should go on the bumper cars.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
It wasn't that late, it was only about nine o'clock, so we decided to get some flashlights and go for a walk on the beach. [SEP] We	went	out on the beach and started to hunt for little sand crabs. [SEP] They are so much fun to try and catch.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
We got about ten sand crabs in a bucket and then decided to let them all go. [SEP] They all	went	crazy. [SEP] The beach was beautiful, the stars were out.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
. They finally got themselves out of their deep holes and they	went	in the ocean and took some rafts and tried to ride the waves. By then it was time for lunch.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And to chill off in the shade since to was getting kind of hot. [SEP] So we sat around and ate hotdogs and milkshakes and then	went	back out in the sand for a while longer, I took a nap, and my husband and the boys played Frisbee. [SEP] It was the Fourth of July; so we decided that we should get off the beach for a while and let the kids take a rest.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
They were everywhere. [SEP] We	went	down to a dock and someone was letting them off on a dock. [SEP] They were all so pretty, it was so much fun.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Well, it was getting late so I think it is time to go home. [SEP] So, we	went	back to the room and we all fell asleep. [SEP] We were going to have to leave the next day, so the next day we decided to play on the beach until late in the afternoon	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
We're running 70 as we come past probably the, probably at Harris Blvd. [SEP] And so I	went	ahead and let my units know up ahead as soon as we got into Matthews, he's getting blue lighted. [SEP] And I felt that he was impaired to go ahead and start another unit then.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And so as I'm backing off, I'm, I'm still keeping an eye on him if he's slowing down a little bit and he goes to highway, to Matthews-Mint Hill and 74 makes a left hand turn. [SEP] And so I	went	ahead and, uh, got back in the chase again because I figured, um, you know, I just figured I'd go ahead, go ahead and chase him because I knew that he couldn't keep up that kind of speed on the, uh, on the Matthews-Mint Hill. [SEP] And Rich was in behind me by then and so we head on the way down Matthews-Mint Hill, we probably running around 80 or 90 miles an hour.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And so he, both pulls in, they both pull in, you know, and I let them know that I lost him and then a Highway Patrolman comes up and, uh, asks, "Which way did he go?" and I say, "He	went	down that way." [SEP] And so he heads out that way spinning tires trying, trying to catch up to the guy.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
It was an afternoon in January, and there was no school that day, and my mom told me that my grandfather, who lived in RI, had died, and I guess at the time I wasn't able to deal with my emotions or that I was in denial that it happened and I remember just running away to my best friend Bonnie's house and not even telling my mom or my dad where I was going, and I got to her house and I told my friend what had happened and she could tell that I was really upset about it, and so I just felt I'd just run away. [SEP] We	went	on our bicycles and we told pretty much the whole way, and I guess that her mom Dottie had called my mom and told her that I was OK because I'm sure that she was worried. [SEP] You know, I all of a sudden ran out of the house with no explanation, but it was very comforting to spend that time with my friend, and I didn't want to be alone and it was a really good experience.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
You know, I all of a sudden ran out of the house with no explanation, but it was very comforting to spend that time with my friend, and I didn't want to be alone and it was a really good experience. [SEP] My friend Maria Cartsokalis, um, who I	went	to school with at St. Andrew's, and we became friends when I was in fifth or sixth grade and she lived across the street from me and I loved to go to her house because she had a pool and my parents did not. [SEP] And so I would go over there and we would watch TV on Saturday mornings, and usually I would spend the night, and, um, so we'd watch TV during the day and then we would go shopping at the mall and her mom always gave us 20 dollars to spend on anything we wanted so that was always fun and I remember we would during the day watch music videos and just hang out and have fun, and she had an older sister named Tina, and it was in high school, and we were in grade school at the time, and we would always try on her clothes and because she was really stylish and had the Guess?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
The meager looking pieces. [SEP] So my mother use to sit back in her chair in the den and talk about how one Saturday Granny, uh, had decided she was going to go to town and you know back then, you're talking, oh probably 1930s, early 1930s, uh, my mother would've been 10 or 12, somewhere around there, and Granny, uh,	went	to the train track to get on the little trolley train, whatever they had at that time to come downtown. [SEP] Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LeakJeffrey.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
That, that was my favorite sport. [SEP] So my senior year, I	went	to the health department, to get a physical. [SEP] That's required for those who are playing sports.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LeakJeffrey.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Now, of course, my dad never talked to me about any of that stuff, but that's another story. [SEP] So we had Sunday dinner and we	went	through the do's and don'ts of sexuality.

Well the thing about it was in, I'm sort of telling this story out of order, but my grand, after my grandfather died and my great grandmother was sort of alone, um, it must have been right around Thanksgiving and she was feeling real depressed or whatever and this lady came and invited her to come to dinner, and when she, and so my grandmother didn't think she really wanted to go and everything, but she thought, "Well, OK," she'd go ahead and go.

[SEP] And I was sitting in my dad's chair waiting on him to come home and, uh, my uh, momma told me daddy wasn't coming home, but uh, that's really the only two things I remember about my daddy being young, uh, I remember one other night, with uh, when he took my brother and sister to a, um, a race car, um, a race or something, but I stayed at home with my mom, and that's really the only three times that I remember my dad, before they split up.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

Well, she looked at the clock and she's like, "Tabatha, get up get up now and come in the living room," and we	went	in the living room and sh, and I'm like, "What Jennifer", you know I wanted to go to sleep, and um, she said, "Did you see what time it was?" [SEP] And I said, "No I didn't see what time it was," and she said, "It was 2:15," well at the time that meant nothing to me, but um, she explained to me and later we watched the Amityville Horrors, and then it really started making sense to me, and speaking of Amityville Horrors, my house	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Like I say, I was playing with some friends of mine and, and I was literally smitten, almost like a sixteen-year-old, by this new woman, so much so to where it was very, very difficult for me focus, on my game that day and I was pretty much a, a weak link in the match for that entire period. [SEP] Well, could never catch the eye of this new player, so the match was over, their match was over, they left, I left, and just kind of	went	on with my life. [SEP] Well, a few weeks after that, I ran into one of the other ladies there who, along with her husband, were friends of mine and I asked her who that person was.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
It was very informative to me I could feel a very, very strong attraction to, Sally, but I knew I had this other relationship going on, um, and didn't really want to do anything to jeopardize a potential relationship with Sally because of the other relationship. [SEP] So, we	went	back, played our match, and as has always been the case with Sally and I, or most of the time has been the case with Sally and I, we won this match. [SEP] After it was over, everyone wanted to go out and eat, but I couldn't because Jocelyn was at home.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And I said, "I can't, I really thought this was just a tennis match, I've got to go home, my daughter's there." [SEP] So, I	went	home, didn't hear anything for a while.

Uh, the story that comes to mind the most for me, um, I guess in my life, is the story of my grandmother who's now presently 85 years old, and actually, had flew down here the Friday after the tragedy, so it was, um, I think it was the fourteenth of September she flew by herself from France to here to visit us, and is still here until December 24th. [SEP] Um, her story actually is what impacted me the most in my life, um, when I think of the things she	went	through growing up, and, um, how my mother was conceived and everything on that nature, which it gets a little personal, but it's, you don't think of your grandmother telling you that, but she did.

[SEP] And supposedly, you know, it snowed more back then and, ah, but, you know, family was closer knit, I guess, so, you know, pros and cons in every, every case but and my, my grandpa, called Jidu in Arabic.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ManserAlexis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

[SEP] I remember this one where one day they were, um, they were driving down the road, and actually I think this one might be a generic tale, but, uh, um they	went	to a gas station or something, and the guy gets out of the car to pump gas and the girl's been sitting in there but it's been a while. [SEP] So she looks around for him in the parking lot and she doesn't see him and she's worried, you know?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ManserAlexis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

One time we lived down in Brooklyn and Miss Sara and she taking care and she did laundry for these millionaires out there on, uh, I can't call the place now, but anyway and she'd come then she'd get Aunt Winnie and several people to help her, you know, do the washing and ironing. [SEP] And one day then, I, I think we didn't have to go to school or something, but I	went	down and, Miss Wheeler was her name, she said, "Don't you want to iron a shirt?" "Oh yeah, but you-," I said, "I can't iron."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillsJanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
The reason I said Louisiana is because that's where I lived all of my life. [SEP] Everyone	went	to Vicksburg, Mississippi to have their babies at the Mercy Hospital because we had no facilities in Lake Providence, the most beautiful place on Earth, surrounded by um, lakes, Cyprus trees, good people, right on the banks of the Mississippi.

Miami, Florida was almost too much for six people in a car to be together for a 10-day period. [SEP] But coming home we stopped in New Orleans and my dad had been on a roller coaster in San Francisco and he thought it was such fun and so we	went	to Pontchartrain Beach in New Orleans and that was nearing the end of the vacation and he said he wanted my brother Fred and me to go for the experience, he thought it was going to be so much fun. [SEP] So we were all excited about it and got on.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MottSara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it, was a really big thing to go to the movie on Saturday mornings. [SEP] And one particular movie theater we	went	to, they would show serials every Saturday, which were a continued story. [SEP] So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you, um, wouldn't know what had taken place.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And there was one other sucker that cost a nickel and we called that an all day sucker, just because you couldn't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long. [SEP] And one other form of refreshment that we got, which really embarrassed my mother because she didn't know anything about this until she	went	with us to the movie one Saturday, there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre. [SEP] And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
No. [SEP] So we	went	out one night to the movie, but before we	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go. [SEP] And we	went	to Open Kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we didn't have money to leave tips. [SEP] We would also drink water.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Anyway, that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre, and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it's kind of a, pretty much of a spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time. [SEP] So we bought our tickets and we	went	into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat, file, all filed in. [SEP] And I just remember seeing, and I was sitting in a middle section, I was not on an end so I had girls I knew on both sides of me.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
We ask him about the car again. [SEP] The price	went	up to five hundred dollars. [SEP] But he'll definitely give it to us, you know what I'm saying, it's no problem.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NesbittFrank.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
But when I was seven, we moved to Pensacola, FL, and um, we, there were four children, and we were enrolled in a Catholic school, because my parents were Catholics, and um, they wanted us to go to the Catholic schools in the South. [SEP] So, I	went	to, I was in the second grade, and I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_O_ConnorChris.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So um, my mother learned of Ira Lee from her very close friend, my girl friend's mother. [SEP] Um and we all	went	to the same school together and the same church together. [SEP] And so that's how we found out about Ira Lee.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_O_ConnorChris.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
She was like our guest, she just ate dinner with us. [SEP] But I'll never forget when we	went	to have a lunch at my girl friend, Patricia's house, where Ira Lee also worked. [SEP] And Ira Lee fixed lunch for us.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_O_ConnorChris.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Then come to find out that during that same summer, this guy that played on our football team had, supposedly was walking through the park, Briarwood Park on, um, Plaza. [SEP] The same, uh, elementary school that we	went	to. [SEP] He was walking home from the basketball court and he supposedly got raped by this dude.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
He was walking home from the basketball court and he supposedly got raped by this dude. [SEP] And, you know what I'm saying, it was real gross because they	went	into details about him having to have stitches and all this stuff by this dude raping him. [SEP] He was supposedly this old man in a black hat and he walked around from neighborhood to neighborhood trying to follow kids.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I mean that and I mean it probably, probably didn't even happen at all. [SEP] It's like one of them little urban legends of, of a man who	went	somewhere and did something bad and just really messed up the minds of all these kids but probably helped us; you know what I'm saying. [SEP] We didn't need to be out at night anyway.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And they were already jealous, a black man making money, or a half back man making money, or whatever you want to call it, and they came and burnt the house down, burnt the chicken coop down, and they killed a cow, or a couple of cows, I ain't too sure about that, but I think they killed a cow or a couple of cows. [SEP] And, um, they tried to take his land from him and they took it from him for a minute, and he	went	to jail for a little bit, and he got out, and still, you know, couldn't get his land, but he bought, bought, and bought, and he got his land back. [SEP] And, um, now, you know, every family reunion is held there and, and, um, the land is divided up, you know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So I go in there, only person there. [SEP] I pull in, I say, "I need my inspection done," my inspection	went	out in November, "and an oil change with the free tire rotation," that's what I said. [SEP] He goes, "OK we'll take care of you," and so I go sit in the waiting room and read my little book.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And she said, "I understand. I understand," and I	went	on further to say, you know, just, just, I gave several reasons that she, she agreed with. [SEP] And I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

It caught her a little bit off guard and she said, "Yes." [SEP] And we	went	and saw one of the poorest movies I've ever seen in my life, Three Men and a Little Lady. [SEP] It's the sequel to Three Men and a Baby.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Uh-huh. [SEP] Anyway, we	went	and saw that movie; both of us hated, hated it and I think we may have actually hold, held hands together in the last half of the movie. [SEP] Didn't kiss.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Didn't kiss. [SEP] Then we	went	to Baskin-Robbins and she got some Chocolate Gold Caramel Ribbon ice cream and I got Mint Chocolate Chip, and we ate and we made a mess and I drove her home. [SEP] And that was our first date and how we met.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Because obviously you're still dating her and it's been five years. [SEP] We	went	to the prom together, junior year. [SEP] That was exciting.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And I asked her if she wanted to wear it since I couldn't, because it would, you know, the hand had the cast on it. [SEP] Anyway, she said, "Yeah, sure," and we giggled and laughed and then we	went	our separate ways and	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

Uh, we grew up in the same, uh, city together. [SEP] We	went	to different high schools but we	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And our families were friends for many years and so we were acquainted that way, but it wasn't until I was probably a sophomore in college that, uh, we started dating. [SEP] And, um, she	went	to Miami University in OH, and I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So Susan still had, uh, a semester or two to finish. [SEP] I was in graduate school and then we, I graduated and we	went	to, moved to Cleveland, she finished up. [SEP] Even though she	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

So, I think it was maybe four years ago, four, four, or five years ago and um, we left, actually just three of my sisters and I	went	. [SEP] And um, we left Connecticut and we were driving down, we were driving in my sister Diane's um, Ford Escort, which she'd had for about a year and a half and uh, we were driving and everything, anticipating good weather and I think we were just about right outside of Savannah, GA and I was driving the car and her car is standard and um, the clutch	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So, I couldn't go out, I think I was like 19 years old and you have to be like 21, uh, 18 in some clubs and 21 to drink, and we decided not to go out, considering everything that had happened that day. [SEP] So, we woke up the next morning, we	went	down and we drove down to FL. [SEP] I think it took us in all about 23 hours, maybe 24, because she, Cape Coral is on the West Coast.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
After we yelled at her for about three hours she decided to slap some sunburn on the back of her, suntan lotion on the back of her leg, and it left a nice white print, like hand print on the back of her leg, and the rest of her got sun burnt. [SEP] So, then we basically um, we visited with our grandmother and I have some step family that lives down there, so one night we	went	out with our cousin Teddy and we uh,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

, like when he, one time we were at my mom's house and she had just made pies and he saw them come out of the oven, and he knew they were hot but it had been sitting on the stove for a little bit. [SEP] And he	went	up to grab it and he burned his fingers and so we told him, you know, times that we burned ourselves and that it hurts and that it will stop. [SEP] And plus, you know, Rob can talk away fire so we had to call Daddy and tell him to talk away Rob, Gage's fire.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
You knew the hearse that he, anyway we had a neighbor who said, "I bet you can't take a hearse and make it into a convertible," and my dad said, "I bet I can." [SEP] Dad	went	out, bought a hearse, cut off the top, and painted it like bright yellow, and it had red velvet seats in it. [SEP] He had a convertible top made for this stupid thing.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And before you know it, the butcher knife came around and cut the little girl's head off. [SEP] And when the little girl	went	to heaven she was crying down to her dad and saying "Daddy, Daddy! Mama cut my head off with the butcher knife."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Mama cut my head off with the butcher knife. [SEP] " Now that knife, when I	went	to sleep it really scared me. [SEP] But the wonderful thing about it my mom was always there close by to let me know that I was OK.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So she said, "Go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we, you know, can follow through with applying for a grant, scholarship grant for you." [SEP] So that night I	went	home and I asked my mother about it and she said, "Baby, I really want you to go to college. [SEP] It's always been my dream that my children all go to school.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

If I could just work, even as a teacher assistant I would be happy. [SEP] " As the years	went	by my prayer was answered and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said, "Have you considered being a teacher assistant?" [SEP] I said, [SEP] "I would love to."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper. [SEP] And I	went	to, um, one of my staff members and I asked her if she would proofread it, and she thought it was an excellent paper. [SEP] And I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

Out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity, so I felt very proud of myself. [SEP] So I	went	on and took the courses, and as I started I think I was taking economics. [SEP] I think that was the last class I took.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
After all of this was, after I, I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of going back to school. [SEP] I just got to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never	went	back. [SEP] But I love what I do and, uh, anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I go for it so.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Um, the, you know, I really don't know. [SEP] Um, that, I really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because I was there I think the first year I	went	there was the year they built a really nice gym, and I don't think they used that gym no more than three years.

There was grass, waving in the breeze and it was rather sad, no paint on the house, but you could see it had been a beautiful home at one time. [SEP] We	went	up the back porch uh, the well was open, anyone could've fallen into the well, it was in the back porch, or the side porch. [SEP] Went in, and, uh, it always, mother had always talked about the staircase and how beautiful it was, and indeed it probably had been.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
As we walked up the stairs, the window was broken and the shade was flapping in the breeze, and the wallpaper was wet from the rain, and the elements had been coming in for years; as we walked through the home, and I have fond memories of that day, I was probably in the fifth or sixth grade, I would imagine. [SEP] Um, we	went	outdoors then,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Now, whether that calf had just wandered in, or whatever I don't know. [SEP] Uh, we ourselves lived in Grand Rapids, Michigan, so we	went	home, uh, from Grandpa's farm that night. Uh,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Typical, as I remember, dream Christmas Eve. [SEP] And we	went	out, and we drove up the driveway, and Daddy	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
. Um, when my mother passed away, she passed away in 1992 and, uh, after her funeral, we	went	out to the farm. By then it, someone else had built a house on the same spot; what had been a dirt road was then a four-lane highway.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RussellMary.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So as we grew up, I, I thought it was a curse, when I was younger, being Japanese. [SEP] Uh,	went	around with, not so much a chip on my shoulder, just, uh, an inferiority complex and didn't realize until I got older that I was very much proud to be Japanese. [SEP] And uh, got to visit Japan a couple of times, and realized that's the best thing God could have given me was to be different because I'm able to help other people go through the same situation.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And, uh, they, they were pretty happy. [SEP] I mean she	went	from being fairly wealthy, though, to being poor-- Hum.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

She was able to see her mother and um, get to know her family again because it had been 22 years. [SEP] So, uh, that was wonderful, and then she	went	one other time, which was her last time, uh, and stayed about a month, and she came back. [SEP] My first trip to Japan, although it was a sad trip, it was a watershed in my life.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

Well, before we	went	to bed. [SEP] But if it was, like too late already well, we didn't listen to them, we couldn't, she didn't tell them to us, because we had to go to bed, but whenever she had time she would tell us.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaCaroline.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
But you don't remember any about yourself? [SEP] Yes, um, like they used to tell me stories that	went	I was little I used to climb everywhere around the house. [SEP] And one of them was that one time I wanted something on top of the bed that couldn't reach and so you said, my mom said to get, to find a way to get it, and so I don't remember what I grabbed, but I grabbed something and I climbed on top of the bed and I grabbed the thing that I wanted and I think they were like surprised because they didn't think that I would actually do it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaCaroline.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Oh yeah! [SEP] My sister when she was like four, she	went	into the walk-in closet in my parent's bedroom and she put baby powder all over herself and all over the clothes. [SEP] And also in that same walk-in closet my sister and I, we would go in there and hide from my dad and when he got home from work and we would wait for him to come in and turn on the light and then when he walked in we'd scare him.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaIvonne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Um, this, this story involved, this "Wood-Monster" story involved kids that uh felt like running away from home and this story involved kids who decided to do just that one late night. [SEP] Um, they sneaked out of their bedroom windows and they all met and	went	into the woods. [SEP] Um, as they thought this was really cool, and they were sitting under a big tree in the woods, the branches started moving, the kids thinking, uh, that the wind was doing it, but when the branches started to slowly come down and start touching them, they got scared, and the branches were trying to wrap around them, then the trunk of the tree started bending also.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SmithPatricia.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
One of my children was really drawn into this story and today she is very sensitive and compassionate with animals. [SEP] Um, I also sent my young adult children Easter bunnies and the loving message that	went	with it, uh, was from the bunny. [SEP] Like, this bunny talked with me at the store and he was so sweet and loving and really wanted to be with one of you, one of my kids and not left on the shelf in the store all by himself, so I would create that kind of story and attach it to the bunnies and send them to my children.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SmithPatricia.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
If it doesn't happen I'll, I'll, you know, it can happen at another time I'm sure. [SEP] We'll be in the same place another time," because minutes	went	by and nothing happened.

So, um, Michaela was going out and I had instructions to call her as soon as I got home, to beep her as soon as I got home so we could discuss the date.

But if he asked me out again I'd probably go out again. [SEP] " So this was Friday night, early, so the next day I	went	out and I bought a Christmas tree and I had a lot of errands to do. In the afternoon Mr. Speckman calls and said, "Really had a good time last night."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And I said, "Yeah I would too." [SEP] So we're talking some more, and I said, "I	went	and got a Christmas tree." [SEP] He said, "What are you going to do this evening?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
You're going out with him again!" [SEP] So we	went	out again and we	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
You never really catch him really laughing he's always really controlled. [SEP] But he tells a good story with a dry sense of humor, and, uh, golly, he spent his career in the Army still; he just	went	to Germany. [SEP] But, uh, those are the two best storytellers I know in our family.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
That was probably, uh, golly, my dad was born in 1926. [SEP] So when he was 15 and 16ish, probably the early 40s, as best I can tell from those stories because they both	went	into the service very late; my dad	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
By the time I was a child, they were well into middle age and were the most incredibly nosy people in this entire town. [SEP] They	went	to the same church we	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Well they had a little cart; had two wheels on it. [SEP] And they hooked it up to a pony and they	went	riding towards Charlotte in the pony cart. [SEP] They got just to the edge of the city, uh, when something spooked the pony and the pony reared up and when he reared up the uh cart turned over.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasKay.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
( ) I hope it come out well. [SEP] Well, we will tell a story about the, my mother and her sister and my grandfather, grandmother and the other five children	went	down to Chattanooga, where they had been raised in a place called Sequatchie Valley and my grandfather worked for the railroad. [SEP] Uh so they had families and friends and they would go back and forth and visit and drive from Charlotte to Chattanooga, TN and back.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
He had an uncle out in CA, and so he rode his motorcycle from Charlotte, NC up to CA, um, not sure but maybe in Los Angeles area. [SEP] And there he	went	in search of his uncle. [SEP] His uncle had been into some kind of mischief and had been put in jail.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Um. [SEP] He had some other brothers and sisters, and they	went	to other homes, but when his parents died. [SEP] Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
they all worked on the farm and he educated his, most of his children, my father	went	to the seventh grade and quit school. [SEP] Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

I'm sure they do ( ) much further back than our ancestors. [SEP] That's because the, the, you remember, uh, I don't know whether you	went	to that park or not.

I heard that story a long time ago, and it is, uh, it has stuck with me. [SEP] Uh, also another one was uh, "The Raven," the poem "The Raven" uh, that we read in school and uh, we had to determine what it was about, and um, it wasn't easy at first for us to do that, and that, that story or poem	went	something like this, "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as if some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door, it is some visitor I said only this, and," uh, "nothing more."

Uh, also another one was uh, "The Raven," the poem "The Raven" uh, that we read in school and uh, we had to determine what it was about, and um, it wasn't easy at first for us to do that, and that, that story or poem	went	something like this, "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as if some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door, it is some visitor I said only this, and," uh, "nothing more." [SEP] Of course the story	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I can remember uh, some of those stories now, uh, my mother would tell the story of a my uh, great grandmother, my grandmother sitting in the door of living room, when uh, my daddy would go to see her, before they got married and, and of course she would sit there until they leave, and sometimes she would act as though she was sleeping and got rather quiet, she would ( ). [SEP] In other words, I	went	to the conclusion that there was strict supervision of, of teenagers uh, while they were under the influence of their parents. [SEP] Uh,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So, immediately, as soon as possible, rather, I got on the phone and I called over to Justine Morrow School and I got a chance to talk with the director who knew about the uh workings of ( ) Foundations and grants. [SEP] I	went	in to conference with them, and I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Uh, and to a study uh, an experience related event. [SEP] So it boiled down and I ended up working on uh the national design of uh, experiences that would help students from small areas make the transition from rural to uh, to larger cities, in eastern NC and of course I based that on the basis of high percentage of individuals who left the area after college and	went	to larger cities many of them succeeded more than we would like to. [SEP] I guess basic problems in the transition from uh, small towns and rural areas to uh, the large cities.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
But I remember when I was in college at A&T State University, W.O. Kerrington speaking uh, and he used for a subject that for every soul open its own way ( ). [SEP] And he	went	on to say that high soul chooses the high way, the low soul chooses the low way. [SEP] And in the midst, is the misty flats which most people choose, and then he	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

But, the high road leading to success and opportunities and even then, though we were quite young, he challenged us it seemed to get through that if we selected the high road that benefits had the possibilities of being numerous and sometimes when I'm out alone, when test and trials come, those words come to me, a group of words were uttered by ( ) that we were expected to learn and we were expected and required in high school to learn poems, to read poems and try to interpret poems that we could think of, and one of them was by Kipling, which was "If" and I don't recall all of it now, but it	went	on to say that "if you can dream and not make your dreams your master, if you can think and not make your thoughts your aim, you can meet with triumph and disaster. Treat those two imposters just the same" and it goes on the say that if you can do all these things, yours is the world and all that is in it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
We were a loving family. [SEP] We did a lot of, most things together, worked together, we grew up in a rural area and we worked together, we ate together, we uh,	went	shopping together. [SEP] We	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

I don't know why I would do that by myself. [SEP] I	went	by myself, basically without one, in a tour group and my visit after I got there. [SEP] I didn't have any problems except uh, when I was getting ready to leave it was in the monsoon season.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
The teachers lived in the community, primarily; they visited the churches. [SEP] And sometimes members of the churches that students	went	to. [SEP] So, they saw the students in non-academic settings as well as in academic settings.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Uh, one final thing that I must mention is religion was more of an important factor in the lives of young people when I was a teenager. [SEP] Growing up, almost everybody	went	to church and students	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Yeah, well, and, uh, another interesting word was "picking". [SEP] I	went	right into the school system and I was teaching and, um, it was a little awkward at times and the kids were, they would tease, and instead of saying, you know, I'm teasing, they would say-- \\ \\ Hello baby!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
My dad is a very, very special man. [SEP] He, um, he grew up in WV and he, um, played football when he was in high school and he	went	right into the service and he was in WWII, he was a medic in the army. [SEP] And he was over in Europe.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And he was over in Europe. [SEP] In fact, I was just talking to him this last Thanksgiving about some of the things that he	went	through when he was in the service and, and traveling across the sea on these boats that had flat bottoms and they would go way up in the, in the water and then smack down, you know, it was very rough.

So I was named after each grandmother and Mama liked "Tammy" and stuck it in the middle. [SEP] So I had a real long name when I	went	to school. [SEP] I was in the first grade before I found out what my whole name was.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I'd been writing "Tammy Watkins." [SEP] I could read and write before I	went	to school, because Mama had a lot of time to spend with me. [SEP] My next sister wasn't born until I was like five years old.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
Rode bikes for a long time until I was a big old girl. [SEP] And we	went	into the woods and there was bunch of vines that covered like a blanket. [SEP] And I'd walk through those vines and it was real shady and cool.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I thought it was a whole lot easier to ride that bike than walking. [SEP] Fixed us a picnic lunch and she brought a book and we	went	out there. [SEP] And she still talks about that.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
No that was, um, that was in Huntersville. [SEP] When Mama left Daddy we	went	and moved out to Huntersville. [SEP] Oh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I hung around with them boys from the fourth grade on up to through to high school. [SEP] But when Mama left Daddy and everything and we moved away and then moved back I still	went	to school with them. [SEP] Kenny, Kenny, huh	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

So I would go out and see my second cousins, not my first cousins because they were all old people as far as I was concerned. [SEP] But when I was, I think one of my earliest recollections, was when I was three years old, Mama and Daddy and I	went	down to, to FL. [SEP] And I remember, going through the lobby of the hotel where we stayed at with my bathing suit on and with one of those God-awful swim caps that everybody that you see when you look in the 40s movies and it felt like I was in a vacuum when I was walking!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So, you couldn't cross the street, you couldn't turn in or turn out or anything, it was just really, really crazy, because they were doing such incredible construction out there. [SEP] And I remember all the headlights on all the cars were painted black for the first half, the first, the top semi-circle was black so that when if you	went	out at night, the light would shine just down on the road and not straight ahead. [SEP] Everybody had window shades, you didn't have blinds back then, but everybody had window shades that were blackout shades and you had to pull them down at night before you turned on any of the lights, because everyone was deathly afraid that the Germans or the Japanese were going to come bomb us.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
So, for fifty cents and hour, I took piano lessons. [SEP] And I	went	around once a week, because I could walk. [SEP] She, Mother would cross the street with me and then I could walk to the piano teacher, whose name was, oh gosh, what was her name?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I never will forget, she had this great big Chow dog, the one, the kind with the black tongue, and I was petrified of that dog! [SEP] She always kept him in the backyard, so I never	went	in the backyard. [SEP] I'd always go in the front door there instead of going around to the back.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
What did you guys, in, in, in your family, with a, with Grandma and Granddaddy, I mean, what kind of trips did you take when you were little? [SEP] Oh, let's see, one time we	went	up to, oh, to the Skyline Dr. We	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

And he was 50 at this point in time, or 51. [SEP] And we	went	down to Atlanta for him to talk to people down there and they told him that they couldn't do anything so if he really wanted to be in the army he needed to come back and go up to the Pentagon. [SEP] So we drove up to Washington, and he	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

And then upstairs there were two huge rooms, one on either side of the house and a bath at the top of the stairs. [SEP] So when they completed all the, um, building out at Fort Bragg and brought in so many troops, every Sunday when we	went	to church, Mother and Daddy would bring home at least one, and usually two, GIs who were there in their uniforms and looked very forlorned; they would bring them home for Sunday dinner. [SEP] Oh that's nice!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I knew she died when you were young. [SEP] Yeah, And, um, when I was 12, in October, when I was 12, she had a, stroke, or actually a blood clot and it	went	to her brain. [SEP] It partially paralyzed her right side.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And the competition was down in Wilmington and it was on the 17th of March, The Ides of March, and so, uh, she drove me down there, and, at that point Mother had had a stroke and was back in the hospital. [SEP] So I	went	down and I played. [SEP] And I won.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
And I was, nervous and all that sort of thing, but anyway I won. [SEP] And we got back to Fayetteville and, I	went	, the, the teacher took me to the hospital and I	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3

It's a very small town that didn't or doesn't have a post office, doesn't have a grocery store, really only has a school and two gas stations. [SEP] But we actually lived in the city of Easley and	went	to Pickens High School, but had also a different phone number.

So I was driving the tractor around, around, and around, and then I got called in for dinner, so I parked the tractor. [SEP] Oh, our house also sat on a hill and, I think it sat on the top of a hill, and then the field and the fencing	went	down, and then across the street was my uncle's land and no one lived there. [SEP] Over there it was another field that was fenced in and I don't think there were any animals over there, but it was a fenced in filed as well.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
I thought for sure, for sure I remembered that my dad said to put it in neutral. [SEP] Yeah, well I remembered wrong so, uh,	went	over and got the tractor out and my dad drove it back, and I don't know what he did to the fence I'm sure that he fixed it I don't remember how badly it was damaged, but I was so upset I really thought I was big stuff. [SEP] I mean I knew how to drive this tractor and I couldn't believe that I remembered wrong and I made that mistake and I first was scared because I thought I was in trouble but then when I realized I wasn't in trouble I was really, you know, I had lost a lot of confidence because I really thought I was big stuff.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
They're not necessarily hicks they're just people who really didn't know any better.
