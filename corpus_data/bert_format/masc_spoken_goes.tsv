No, because -- and I know this is difficult, but it	goes	like this. [SEP] And this is the best I can put it, other than what I tried to do in my	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	4
And how did that harm you? [SEP] Well, it	goes	against my beliefs. [SEP] I have no problems with my faith and evolution. [SEP] They're not mutually exclusive. [SEP] No further questions of this witness.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	4
You have no objection to Pandas being in the library? [SEP] No, absolutely not. [SEP] I don't object to Pandas being in the library, just like I don't object to, you know, any of the other books being in the library, as long as -- as long as it's the appropriate level and -- you know, I mean, there is a censorship process that	goes	into putting books in the library. [SEP] So, I mean, as long as it has gone through that process and it's approved to be there, I don't have a problem with it being there. [SEP] The statement that the school district developed to be read as part of the biology class, is it your understanding that the statement that was drafted in January, 2005, or for use in January, 2005, was modified in June of 2005? [SEP] Are you aware of that?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	4
Texas, and the Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore. [SEP] These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. [SEP] The format and the rules are those negotiated by representatives of the two campaigns. [SEP] Only the subjects tonight and the questions are mine. [SEP] The format tonight is that of a conversation. [SEP] The only prevailing rule is that no single response can ever, ever exceed two minutes. [SEP] The prevailing rule for the audience here in the hall is as always, absolute quiet, please. [SEP] Good evening, Governor Bush, Vice President Gore. [SEP] The end of our 90 minutes last week in Boston, the total time each of you took was virtually the same. [SEP] Let's see if we can do the same tonight, or come close. [SEP] Governor Bush, the first question	goes	to you. [SEP] One of you is about to be elected the leader of the single-most powerful nation in the world, economically, financially, militarily, diplomatically, you name it. [SEP] Have you formed any guiding principles for exercising this enormous power? [SEP] I have, I have. [SEP] First question is what's in the best interests of the United States? [SEP] What's in the best interests of our people? [SEP] When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question. [SEP] Is it in our nation's interests? [SEP] Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests. [SEP] Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests. [SEP] Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest. [SEP] I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president.

United States should do right now to resolve that conflict over there? [SEP] The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there. [SEP] We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured. [SEP] We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on. [SEP] I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there. [SEP] The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it	goes	hour-by-hour and day-by-day now. [SEP] It's a very tense situation there. [SEP] But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there. [SEP] It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue. [SEP] Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there. [SEP] And we just have to take it day-to-day right now. [SEP] But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing. [SEP] Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives. [SEP] They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring. [SEP] And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd. [SEP] Governor	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	4
On hate crimes laws? [SEP] No. [SEP] We've got one in Texas. [SEP] And guess what? [SEP] The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them? [SEP] They're going to be put to death. [SEP] A jury found them guilty. [SEP] It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death. [SEP] And it's the right cause. [SEP] It's the right decision. [SEP] Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that	goes	on in America. [SEP] Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence. [SEP] People are stopped, and we have to do something about that. [SEP] My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect. [SEP] So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces. [SEP] It's an issue throughout our society. [SEP] And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more. [SEP] I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care. They're tolerant people. They're good, tolerant people. It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them. What -- if you become president, Governor, are th	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	4
ntains local control, it doesn't stop there. [SEP] Because I want to give new choices to parents. [SEP] To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. [SEP] I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. [SEP] For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. [SEP] And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. [SEP] I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. [SEP] I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. [SEP] Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about. [SEP] If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that	goes	mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority. [SEP] If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can't do education. [SEP] You can't do both. [SEP] You have to choose. [SEP] I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support. [SEP] Governor Bush, two minutes.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	4
Gentlemen, welcome to you both. [SEP] By coin toss, the first question	goes	to Senator Kerry. [SEP] Senator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	4
He been a senator for 20 years. [SEP] He voted to increase taxes 98 times. [SEP] When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times. [SEP] He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4. [SEP] 2 trillion. [SEP] He talks about PAYGO. [SEP] I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he	goes	ahead and spends. [SEP] He's proposed $2. [SEP] 2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	4
The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. [SEP] That's great. [SEP] I appreciate that very much. [SEP] All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion. [SEP] Mr. President, let's have a new question. [SEP] It	goes	to you. [SEP] And let's get back to economic issues. [SEP] Health insurance costs have risen over 36 percent over the last four years according to The Washington Post. [SEP] We're paying more. [SEP] We're getting less.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	4
In fact, we put together a $5. [SEP] 6 trillion surplus in the '90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security. [SEP] If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given -- President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America -- just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075. [SEP] The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut. [SEP] Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut. [SEP] I don't. [SEP] I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that	goes	to people earning more than $200,000 a year. [SEP] And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	4
Thank you, Senator Kerry. [SEP] Well, that brings these debates to a close, but the campaign	goes	on. [SEP] I want to wish both of you the very best of luck between now and Election Day.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	4
