Significantly, it was in several of these [labor-intensive] more fragmented industries—textiles, apparel, furniture, and some food processing—that the mass retailer (the department stores, mail-order houses and chain stores) began to coordinate the flow of goods from manufacturer to consumer. [SEP] In those industries where substantial economies of scale and scope did not exist in production, high-volume flows through the processes of production and distribution came to be guided—and the resulting cost reductions achieved—by the buying departments of mass retailers, retailers who handled a variety of related products through their facilities.43 [SEP] And so we	arrive	at the new information technologies of the 1980s. [SEP] These have begun to create integrated channels among enterprises in the three industries, facilitating even more product proliferation and stimulating changes in merchandising, inventory management, internal production practices, and methods of using human resources. [SEP] When it comes to the driving force behind the late twentieth-century industrial transformation, lean retailing is at the forefront of that revolution.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1
s long as only one or two retailers required rapid replenishment, manufacturers could get away with this type of solution. [SEP] But it didn’t take long before most retailers wanted orders for basic apparel items replenished this way and they became very demanding. [SEP] As an increasing number of suppliers are dancing to the demands of rapid replenishment, they are finding it a complex tune. [SEP] Manufacturers suddenly have much more to do than just make clothing—they are being asked to do work previously done by the retailer, such as picking and packing the order for each store from the retailer’s warehouse. [SEP] Each store’s order has to be put in a separate carton, labeled with its own bar code, and accompanied by an advance shipping notice. [SEP] Moreover, retailers want an order to	arrive	at their distribution center at an exact time. [SEP] If the truck is late, the driver often has to wait until the end of the day to unload, if allowed to do so at all. [SEP] Deliveries made a day late are sometimes refused and sent back. [SEP] Such retail requirements have certainly put substantial pressure on apparel manufacturers to change their own practices. [SEP] Chapter 5 described some of the basic changes many manufacturers are making to stay in the game with lean retailers. [SEP] But even if lean retailing has led to suppliers’ wide-scale adoption of bar codes and EDI-related capabilities, divergent production strategies among suppliers have emerged. [SEP] Conceivably, two business units could each meet the same lean retailing requirements yet have very different internal practices	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1
The vast majority of workers in the apparel industry are involved in assembly. [SEP] This is illustrated in Table 9.1 (page 158) for the men’s and boys’ shirt industry. [SEP] In 1990, 73 percent of all workers in this industry were classified as working in the sewing department; 91 percent were sewing machine operators. [SEP] Given the predominant share of workers in assembly, organization of work in the sewing room has been the central focus of management attention. [SEP] The sewing rooms of most apparel factories are similar in overall appearance. [SEP] Apparel parts, trim pieces, buttons, zippers, and thread	arrive	at one end of the room and are separated for each operation, or subassembly. [SEP] As the last chapter noted, large apparel firms usually operate a central cutting room that provides cut parts to an average of five sewing plants.9 [SEP] About two-thirds of the production volume of our surveyed business units did their marker-making, spreading, and cutting in a single location. [SEP] Most would deliver cut goods to sewing plants many times a week; however, when cutting is done hundreds of miles from the sewing plants, weekly deliveries are the norm. [SEP] Trucks take fresh parts to the plants and return with finished goods for the distribution center. [SEP] Sewing rooms are generally arranged in rows of workers, each seated at a machine doing one operation on a bundle of parts.

[SEP] Sometimes the undercarriage is chromed and gold-plated. [SEP] Painting low-rider cars is a specialty only available at certain paint and body shops, so low riders must be aware of such businesses. [SEP] Besides the painting of the car, other decorative designs or motifs may also be applied, such as pinstriping, fancy lace (a fire design), and murals. [SEP] Murals of an Aztec or Mayan scene or La Virgen de Guadalupe are popular icons painted on the trunk, hood, or roof of the car. [SEP] Even though there is similarity in the styles, each car is very different in the final production. [SEP] There are many techniques employed to	arrive	at a unique personal style. [SEP] For instance accessories from different-year models are interchanged, such as side panels from a 1957 model may be cut and welded to a 1952 car, or “’57 Cadillac tail lamps on a ’62 Chevy Impala” (Bright, 196). [SEP] Low riders are usually young urban Chicanos, between the ages of eighteen and thirty, and there can be two and three generations of low riders in one family. [SEP] The cost of fixing and maintaining a low-rider car is fairly high, so the owner typically is a working person. [SEP] Since finding older cars, say from the 1950s, is becoming difficult, some low riders now customize small trucks, motorcycles, and bicycles as well. [SEP] The movie Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life) depicts the work that goes into customizing a pickup truck.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] This custom is not particular to the Chicano community, and nativity scenes can be found throughout the country during the Christmas season. [SEP] It is thought that Saint Francis of Assisi is the saint responsible for much of the veneration of the infant Jesus, and the custom of creating nativity scenes or monuments to the birth of Christ has been going on for hundreds of years. [SEP] In private homes nacimientos are usually set up for the first night of Las Posadas, which starts on December 16 and continues until December 24. [SEP] A nacimiento is left in place until El Día de los Reyes, Epiphany, on January 6, when the three kings	arrive	to visit the Christ child.

ant) A tradition marking the beginning of the Christmas season with the dramatization of the search for lodging in Bethlehem by Joseph and Mary. [SEP] It always includes a procession with singing and music and starts nine days before Christmas. [SEP] The story, in the form of a novena (Catholic nine-days devotion), is based on the gospel of St. Luke. [SEP] For nine consecutive nights before Christmas Eve, la Noche Buena (the good night), los peregrinos (the pilgrims) representing Joseph and Mary visit a different home each night, reenacting the search for an inn by Joseph and Mary. [SEP] Los mesoneros, those who portray the innkeepers, keep refusing them lodging. [SEP] Los peregrinos form a procession, and children and angels hand-carry the small figures of the Holy Family. [SEP] When they	arrive	at a home they ask for shelter and sing carols. [SEP] Las Posadas occurs from December 16 through December 24. [SEP] Nine different homes are opened to the pilgrims and food and drink are offered after the peregrinos have been denied lodging. [SEP] Most homes will have a nativity scene, a nacimiento, set up for the prayers and singers. [SEP] An important tradition of these festivities is the piñata that is brought out and broken by the children. [SEP] There is evidence that piñatas originated from this Christmas celebration. [SEP] Posadas are still held today in many Mexican communities in the United States. [SEP] Some are organized by church groups, but recently others have been organized for commercial purposes by city entities.

n the line of flight of the bullet from the gun through the corresponding hole to the sandbox, with a “Gaussian” or normal bell-shaped distribution of bullet densities falling away from the peak of each mound. [SEP] When we use monochromatic light rather than bullets, we note the following: If the light hits the sandbox, changed into a photon-counter surface, we find that the size of the energetic impact is the same each time a photon hits the surface. [SEP] Photons of a given wavelength have a fixed energy. [SEP] A photon either is recorded at a point on the surface or not. [SEP] Whenever one is recorded, the full parcel of energy has been detected at the surface. [SEP] Now if only one hole is open, one gets the Gaussian mound result. [SEP] Most photons pass through the hole unscathed and	arrive	in a straight line at the photon-counter surface. [SEP] A Gaussian distribution peaked at that center is present because some photons are deflected slightly by the edges of the hole. [SEP] But if two holes are open, then one gets the famous interference pattern of light and dark interfering circles spreading from the centers on the photon-counter surface that were the peaks of the mounds seen when hole or hole was open. [SEP] Of course, as Feynman points out, there is no way to account for this oddness in classical physics.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1
 first quantum system becomes entangled in very complex ways with the other complex quantum system, which may be thought of as the environment. [SEP] Rather like water waves swirling into tiny granular nooks and crannies along a rugged fractal beach, the initial coherent Schrödinger equation representing the initial quantum system swirls into tiny and highly diverse patterns of interaction with the quantum system representing the environment. [SEP] The consequence of this intermixing is decoherence. [SEP] To understand the core of decoherence, one must understand that the exhibition of interference phenomena, the hallmark of quantum mechanics noted in the double-slit photon experiment, requires that literally all the propagating possible pathways in Feynman’s sum over histories that are to	arrive	at each point on the photon-counter surface, do in fact	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1
SEP] In this sense, statistical mechanics surely does “account for” classical mechanics. [SEP] Many argue that this weaker sense of reductionism suYces. [SEP] Well, suYces for what? [SEP] That is a bit harder to be clear about. [SEP] Roughly, the temptation is to say, “Temperature is nothing but the average kinetic energy of the atoms in the system”; that is, we appear to reduce the ontological furniture of the universe. [SEP] I suspect that this familiar ontological move is not always warranted. [SEP] Let’s take some cases that Phil Anderson uses to exemplify “emergence.” [SEP] Gold is a yellow, malleable metal familiar to all of us. [SEP] Nowhere in the quantum mechanical description of atomic gold are these macroscopic properties to be found. [SEP] Moreover, there is no deductive way to	arrive	at these macroscopic collective properties from the underlying quantum mechanics of atoms of gold. [SEP] Rather, we observe the macroscopic properties, find lawful features of those properties, then attempt to link them to suYcient conditions in our quantum mechanical description of matter. [SEP] Another class of cases Anderson refers to is broken symmetries. [SEP] A familiar example would be a pole standing vertically on an horizontal slab on the earth’s surface. [SEP] The vertical pole is unstable in the face of gravity and will soon fall. [SEP] It might fall and point in any direction. [SEP] Hence, the system has the full symmetry of the plane prior to the falling of the pole. [SEP] In due course, the pole does fall over and points in some specific direction.

 it is difficult to know which way to look, it has a very beautiful tower — Muntorren (Mint Tower). [SEP] Originally a medieval gate guarding the entrance to the city, it was damaged by fire in 1619, and the clock tower was added by de Keyser during the renovations of 1620. [SEP] In 1699 the carillon was installed and this still fills the air with its regular bell rounds. [SEP] During the war with France in 1672, when Amsterdam had its supply of money cut off, the tower was transformed for a short time into the city mint, and the name has remained since that time. [SEP] In the shadow of the tower, and floating on the Singel canal (the medieval protective moat for the city) is the Bloemenmarkt (Flower market). [SEP] The daily market has been held for centuries, when the flower sellers would	arrive	by canal with boats laden with blooms. [SEP] Today the stalls still float on the water but are permanently attached to the canal wall. [SEP] The blooms they sell bring a splash of color to even the dullest Amsterdam day. [SEP] Stroll along the market until you reach Konigsplein and take a left down Leidsestraat.

Immediately as you enter the compound you can get a bird’s-eye view of Grave Circle A, where the Royal grave shafts were found, and then climb to the top of the settlement to view the remains of the Royal Palace. [SEP] From here the views of the surrounding rolling countryside are magnificent. [SEP] Half a mile below the city is an immense Beehive tomb cut into the hillside and lined with stone blocks. [SEP] The acoustics inside the tomb are very precise, exaggerating the sound of your approaching fellow visitors. [SEP] If a party of schoolchildren	arrive	to test out the tomb, it may be a good idea to beat a hasty retreat for the sake of your ears! [SEP] Further east from Mycenae is another ancient site also renowned for its acoustics. [SEP] The Theater of Epidauros (Epidavros), was built in the fourth century b.c. and could hold an audience of 12,000 people. [SEP] Live performances still take place here every summer. [SEP] The theater does not sit in splendid isolation but was part of a large settlement based around the Sanctuary of Asklepios — one of the most important centers of healing in the ancient world. [SEP] Today there is little left of the site and it is difficult to imagine hospitals, spas, and faith-healing practices catering to travelers from across the Greek world.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] Sarongs, printed dresses, and shirts in light fabrics are sold in almost every craft stall in the straw markets. [SEP] Light-cotton Androsia clothing, made on Andros, is perfect for the Bahamian climate; you’ll find these items all over the Bahamas. [SEP] Straw hats, which will protect you from the strong sun and save you from a wrinkle or two, are abundant and inexpensive.

The Mountains To the Balinese, the mountains are the abode of the gods, the source of the rivers that water their crops, and of occasional outbursts of destructive fury. [SEP] The highest of them are active or dormant volcanoes: Gunung Batur simmers more or less continuously while Gunung Agung erupts violently once every few hundred years. [SEP] When you set out for the higher altitudes, be prepared for cold with damp mists, or for scorching sunshine.Either condition is possible. [SEP] Many tour companies run day trips, sometimes combining visits to Besakih (see page 60) and Penelokan (see page 58). [SEP] This is an easy way to see the views, but you will	arrive	at the same time as hundreds of others. [SEP] With more and more accommodations opening, think about overnighting at a mountain resort, or an inexpensive guest house.

EP] Ash covered much of northern Bali, ruining crops, blocking up the rivers, and causing mudslides that took many lives. [SEP] Besakih, known as Bali’s “mother temple,” stands high up on the southwestern slopes of the mountain. [SEP] From a distance you’ll see a forest of black thatched, pagoda-like meru roofs rising in tiers above the rice terraces, with the volcano as a backdrop. [SEP] This was probably even a holy place in the pre-Hindu era. [SEP] During more than a thousand years it has evolved into a complex of nearly 200 temples and shrines. [SEP] The most important group stands in the middle, representing the three manifestations of God: Brahma (right, with great red banners), Shiva (center, with big white banners), and Vishnu (left, with large black banners). [SEP] Most tour buses	arrive	at mid-morning and mid-afternoon, but no matter when you visit, you will be harassed by hawkers, goaded by guides, and ordered by gatekeepers to make donations. [SEP] Local people don’t see this commercial activity as inappropriate; to them, a temple isn’t a holy place until the gods are present, and that only happens during a religious ceremony. [SEP] There are also guides offering their services to those who want to climb Gunung Agung; only the fit and well-prepared should attempt it, and only in the dry season. [SEP] Even then, the expedition can take as long as twelve hours and involves a lot of slipping and sliding on stony slopes.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1

R CHILDREN Barcelona is an excellent city for children.

[SEP] The Zoo (Parc Zoológic, on Ciutadella Park, Tel. 93/221 25 06), has the world’s only albino gorilla in captivity. [SEP] Poble Espanyol (Avda. del Marqués de Comillas, on Montjuïc), a re-creation of a Spanish village with architectural styles from all over Spain, is very popular with families. [SEP] The amusement parks on both Montjuïc and Tibidabo (Parc d’Atraccions) are very entertaining, and kids love to	arrive	at the former via aerial cable car (see page 69).

The game of cricket is Bermuda’s life blood, and the Cup Match is the premier sporting — and social — event of the year. [SEP] The whole island is in a holiday mood when the event is held in late July or early August, and most shops and many restaurants close. [SEP] Everyone’s attention focuses on enjoying the day. [SEP] You are not just watching the match; you are watching a society at play. [SEP] Bermuda’s maritime heritage can be seen most clearly in the many regattas and ocean races held during the summer. [SEP] Local Bermuda dinghies, with white sails unfurled, cut through the azure waters. [SEP] Large sleek sailboats ply the Atlantic from the US in an ocean-going race at least once each year, and there is nothing quite like watching these beautiful vessels	arrive	in harbor (see page 95). [SEP] Large crowds gather in Hamilton to welcome winner and losers alike. [SEP] There are also frequent golf, tennis, and rugby tournaments. [SEP] Road races, carting, fun runs, triathlons, and marathons are all regular activities, and many of Bermuda’s sporting associations hold invitationals or open tournaments.

Bermuda is not a duty-free island. [SEP] In fact, since there is no income tax for the local population, charging duty on imported goods is one way for the government to raise funds. [SEP] Duty varies on the type of goods but is always included in the price. [SEP] However, there is no sales tax at all in Bermuda, so here is your opportunity to save a little. [SEP] Tax-free shops will claim to save you up to 30 percent on prices back home, but this is not universal. [SEP] It is always important to do some research at home before you	arrive	so that you can compare prices. [SEP] Some goods are only a little cheaper in Bermuda, but you might want a “real” bargain. [SEP] In many ways, Bermuda is still a vendor of fine British goods, although the range of merchandise is definitely expanding. [SEP] Bermudian traders have always bought directly from the manufacturers rather than through middlemen, which has traditionally resulted in a cheaper price than you would find at home. [SEP] However, government-imposed import duty means that prices might not be as advantageous as they once were.

The American Pioneers The first Americans to come to California from the eastern states were Boston fur traders taking the Cape Horn route at the end of the 18th century. [SEP] They didn’t stay for long, but gradually other traders and fur trappers began to	arrive	overland through Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, settling only in small numbers until the famous covered wagons began their heroic treks of the 1840s. [SEP] The hardships the pioneers suffered in the Sierra Nevada mountains, Death Valley, and the Mojave Desert became the stuff of California legend, the most tragic being the fate of 87 pioneers who set out from Illinois in 1846. [SEP] While attempting to cross the Sierra Nevada, George Donner’s wagon train became snowed in, and from November until February was stuck high in the mountains north of Lake Tahoe, at a point now known as the Donner Pass.

If you’re heading west from downtown, avoid the freeway and follow another great thoroughfare, Wilshire Boulevard. [SEP] Once an Indian trail, in its heyday this 16-mile (25-km) roadway glittered with the prosperity of its department stores and luxury hotels. [SEP] A living museum of the Art Deco architecture that characterized Los Angeles’s rise to greatness during the 1920s and 1930s, the section of Wilshire between La Brea and Fairfax avenues, known as the “miracle mile,” is slowly being renovated after years of neglect. [SEP] Notable buildings include the former Bullocks Wilshire department store standing at the corner of Kingsley, and the Franklin Life Insurance building situated at Van Ness and Wilshire. [SEP] The primary reason to cruise along Wilshire is to	arrive	at Hancock Park, home of the famous La Brea Tar Pits. [SEP] Here petroleum deposits ooze through fractures to the surface and evaporate, leaving natural tar lakes (brea is Spanish for “tar”). [SEP] From viewing stations, visitors may observe the excavation of fossilized remains. [SEP] The adjacent George C. Page Museum (5801 Wilshire Boulevard) has on display the skeletons of mammoths, mastodons, saber-toothed tigers, and other unfortunate creatures who became trapped in the sticky tar during the last Ice Age. [SEP] Next door to the tar pits is the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), whose provocative modern architecture houses one of the state’s best art collections, including outstanding examples of Nepalese, Indian, and Tibetan art, Japanese scroll paintings, pre-Columbian art, and	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] Most hotels offer family amenities and shows, many of them first-class (although kids are never allowed to loiter in the casinos). [SEP] Any show by Cirque du Soleil (at Treasure Island or Bellagio) is worth seeing — this international troupe of performers reaches mystical heights. [SEP] If it’s the traditional Las Vegas you dream of, the best time to	arrive	is at sunset, when the city lights loom out of the desert darkness.

The first foreign visitors to the Canaries are thought to have been Arab sailors who landed on Gran Canaria some 2,000 years ago and were met warmly. [SEP] In later centuries the islanders’ gracious hospitality was to cost them dearly. [SEP] Europeans did not	arrive	until the 14th century, when the Genoese sailor Lanzarotto Marcello colonized the island, known then in native tongue as Tytheroygatra and subsequently as Lanzarote. [SEP] Slave traders, treasure seekers, and missionaries all followed in Lanzarotto’s wake, but it was not until 1402 that the European conquest of the Canaries began in earnest.

In the Wake of Cortés The first recorded Europeans to	arrive	in the Yucatán, in 1511, were doubly unfortunate: a group of Spanish sailors survived a shipwreck on the coast of what is now Quintana Roo, only to be sacrificed by the Mayan natives.

[SEP] Now that the cult of Mao has faded in glory, the stations and the shrines are uncrowded and Changsha has returned to its age-old role as a rather prosaic regional center of trade and culture.

[SEP] Don’t underestimate newcomers to the ring. [SEP] Among them may be another El Cordobés on the way up. [SEP] Perhaps the best seats to buy for a first fight are sol y sombra, tendido bajo, lower stands in the sun part of the time and in the shade the other. [SEP] The first two rows are the most expensive. [SEP] Admission prices are lower in Alicante than in Benidorm. [SEP] Tickets everywhere are 20 percent more than the official price when purchased from agencies and as much as 40 percent more from hotels. [SEP] Whether you have booked in advance or not, try to	arrive	at the plaza de toros with an hour to spare, enough time to watch the crowd and feel the tension rising. [SEP] The corrida always starts on time — even if the clock occasionally has to be stopped. [SEP] The usual six bulls, fought by three matadors, give an average spectacle of 21⁄2 hours, so a cushion hired on the spot is a good idea. [SEP] You should remember that the bullfight is neither a sport nor a competition. [SEP] It’s a highly ritualized three-act art form that depends initially on the aggressiveness of the bull and the torero’s skill and ability to take risks. [SEP] No risk, and there would be no bullfight.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1
Where to Go Most visitors to the Costa del Sol are based in one of the large coastal resorts to the west of Málaga (Torremolinos, Benalmádena, Fuengirola, Marbella or Estepona), while far fewer head east toward Nerja, Almuñécar, or even as far as Almería. [SEP] Although the main aim for many is to relax on the beach and soak up as much sun as possible, increasing numbers	arrive	to play golf. [SEP] It comes as little surprise, therefore, that the road signs proclaim the area west of Málaga not just the Costa del Sol, but the Costa del Golf also. [SEP] A few visitors forsake the beach for a day or two and venture out to either the amazingly varied historic towns and cities or the natural wonders of the national parks nearby. [SEP] Málaga, Ronda, and perhaps Gibraltar can be seen in a day, but Sevilla, Córdoba, Granada, and the parks necessitate at least an overnight stop.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1
Málaga to Nerja Leaving the suburbs of Málaga, you	arrive	immediately in Rincón de la Victoria, a Spanish resort largely given over to weekend apartments owned by the local city dwellers. [SEP] But prehistoric man was here first, occupying a cave on the Málaga side of the town known as Cueva del Tesoro (Treasure Cave). [SEP] Cave paintings and prehistoric remains, including a shrine to the goddess Noctiluca, have been found and there is a beautiful underground lake with stalactites. [SEP] According to legend, five Moorish kings buried a huge treasure inside the cave, but it has never been found. [SEP] Torre del Mar is the gateway to the wine and raisin-producing region of the Axarquía, and its capital, Vélez-Málaga, which lies 4 km (2 1/2 miles) inland.

For most other museums this would be treasure enough, yet in Iráklion there are also impressive Greek and Roman artifacts to enjoy. [SEP] The museum is a must for those intending to visit the ancient sites, since the objects here add life to the now empty cities and palaces. [SEP] To fully appreciate all of its glories will take at least a couple of hours — the exquisite detail in painting on pottery and frescoes, and the fine workmanship in jewelry and everyday tools is breathtaking. [SEP] Try to visit early to avoid the large tour groups who	arrive	in the middle of the day. [SEP] The 20 rooms are arranged in chronological order, grouping artifacts from each site. [SEP] Although you will surely find your own favorite pieces, here are some of the highlights you will discover on your tour. [SEP] Room 1 has the earliest finds, dating from 6000 b.c. (Neolithic and Pre-Palace periods). [SEP] Many were found at Móchlos on the northeastern coast. [SEP] Primitive pottery is on display — including a rather naïve clay bull with an acrobat holding one horn — and finer work such as a stone pyxis (jewelry box) incised with geometric patterns and a reclining animal. [SEP] Room 2 is the first of two rooms displaying finds from the Old-Palace period (2000–1700 b.c.), including the earliest examples of fine Kamáresware pottery with its polychrome decor	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] Evans’ subsequent attempts to recreate areas of the palace have met with intense criticism from other scholars but Knossós is now Crete’s premier attraction and rightly so. [SEP] Though there is no documented proof, most Cretans believe that Knossós was the site of the famed battle between Theseus and the Minotaur in the Labryinth below King Minos’ palace. [SEP] You may wish you had a ball of golden thread as you explore the maze of small rooms here, as it is very difficult to follow the map provided. [SEP] It also becomes very busy in the middle of the day so	arrive	early if you want to contemplate the site with few distractions. [SEP] The first palace at Knossós was built around 2000 b.c. in the Old Palace era, but this was destroyed by a massive earthquake only 300 years later. [SEP] Most of the remains seen at the site today constitute the second palace built following the disaster which also coincided with a Golden Age of Minoan society or the New Palace era — 1700 b.c., when the people were rich through trade, and artistic endeavor was at its peak. [SEP] The palace grew continuously through the following years resulting in a complex of around 1200 small rooms several stories high covering over 20,000 sq m (215,278 sq ft). [SEP] The construction was immensely complicated with light wells illuminating lower chambers and polythyra, masonry supports t	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1

[SEP] Sheer cliffs up to 300 m (984 ft) high bound the caldera, and a number of whitewashed settlements nestle along their crests — looking from a distance like icing melting down the sides of a Christmas cake. [SEP] The main town of the island is Firá, set atop the high cliffs in the center of the long interior curve. [SEP] Its buildings tumble down towards the water below giving stunning views. [SEP] A narrow cobbled trail of 587 steps leads from the town to the small port below, now the domain of a fleet of donkeys that wait to carry cruise ship passengers into town. [SEP] For those who would prefer a quicker method there is also a cable car which wings you from sea level in a couple of minutes. [SEP] Most commercial ferries	arrive	at a new port of Athinios further along the coast. [SEP] Firá is a shopper’s paradise, a series of narrow alleys where you can wander free from the fear of traffic, although do keep eyes and ears open for donkeys. [SEP] You can buy anything from a reproduction icon to a genuine Fabergé egg; designer jewelry of the finest quality and designer clothing by the most desirable ‘names.’ Find a spot for a drink at sunset, which has to be one of the most spectacular on earth.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1
Inland from Benidorm The mountains you see off in the distance on Benidorm’s horizon are fragrant with wild herbs and lavender, and in July and August the hedges are lush with blackberries that few local people bother to pick. [SEP] Drive south on the motorway to Villajoyosa, then take the road that leads to Sella. [SEP] The countryside is undistinguished, until suddenly you look down on the emerald-green waters of the Amadorio Dam, a favourite haunt of fishermen and discerning picnickers. [SEP] Within another 5 km (3 miles) you	arrive	at Sella village, dwarfed beneath an extraordinary plateau. [SEP] From Sella the road winds higher through terraced hillsides filled with vines until it reaches its highest point at Puerto de Tudóns (1,015 metres/3,345 feet). [SEP] About 8 km (5 miles) on, a secondary road leads to Peñaguila, an exquisite old Moorish village with a sturdy ruined castle.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1
ross shark-infested waters to Florida on improvised rafts. [SEP] Facing a dramatic influx of Cubans, President Clinton abolished the US policy of automatic asylum to Cuban refugees, placing them in a makeshift tent settlement in Guantánamo Bay Naval Base. [SEP] In the opinion of many, Cuba is an isolated socialist dinosaur. [SEP] Yet it — and its aging leader — soldier on against all odds. [SEP] The US embargo, denounced by an ever-increasing majority in the United Nations, is spurred on by vehement anti-Castro lobbying by Cubans in southern Florida. [SEP] Still, changes in the status quo seem likely. [SEP] But nearly four decades after the Cuban missile crisis, the world continues to wait, wondering whether a lifting of US trade and tourism sanctions or a change in leadership in Cuba will	arrive	first.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-History.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1
 big song-and-dance production in the flesh (so to speak) is de riguer. [SEP] The Tropicana in Havana (Calles 72 and 43, Marianao; Tel. 33-7507), founded in 1939 in a dazzling open-air arena, is indisputably the queen of cabarets. [SEP] The likes of Nat King Cole performed here in pre-revolutionary times. [SEP] With a 32-piece orchestra and a cast of over 200 (some parading in impossibly large headdresses), the sheer scale of the spectacle will make your head spin. [SEP] The show regularly kicks off at 9:30pm, and a shorter performance follows later; there are also a restaurant and disco. [SEP] Reservations and transportation can be arranged at your hotel for US$60. [SEP] You can always visit independently, but the venue, situated in the suburb of Marianao, is tricky to find, and you might	arrive	only to find no tickets remaining. [SEP] Havana’s next-best cabaret show, smaller and less expensive, is Cabaret Parisien, at the Hotel Nacional (Calles 21 and O, Vedado; Tel. 30-3564), nightly at 10:30pm; admission is US$35. [SEP] The Tropicana in Santiago de Cuba (Autopista Nacional km 1.5, with signs from Plaza de la Revolución; Tel. 4-3036) fills an enormous, recently constructed complex on the city’s northern outskirts. [SEP] It is no less impressive than Havana’s but a bit less gaudy.

ing blow to the population of Louisiana. [SEP] Overnight, it appeared, they had been handed over to King Charles III of Spain — though the treaty was not announced until 1764. [SEP] It all made perfect sense to King Louis XV, cousin of Charles (both were Bourbons), for the French and Indian War, known in Europe as the Seven Years War, had been disastrous for French interests abroad. [SEP] Britain won Canada and everything east of the Mississippi, including Spanish Florida. [SEP] To Louis, Louisiana was now isolated in a British-ruled part of the world, a money-losing outpost that seemed to have no future. [SEP] It must have come as an almost unbearable shock to the patriotic Frenchmen of New Orleans to be told that they were Spanish citizens. [SEP] Waiting for the first Spanish governor to	arrive	put a huge strain on the disillusioned society. [SEP] When Governor Antonio de Ulloa finally sailed up the Mississippi in 1766, four years after the treaty was signed, a crashing storm erupted, as if an omen for the climate ahead. [SEP] The governor, a scholarly retired naval officer with good intentions, was accompanied by a contingent of 80 Spanish soldiers, most of retirement age. [SEP] The high-society frolics of the Vaudreuil era were over; the Spanish governor’s wife froze out the Creole ladies of New Orleans from official invitation lists. [SEP] French-speaking citizens protested the snub with a petition and a demonstration that got out of control and turned into violence. [SEP] Spain called it treason. [SEP] The harassed Ulloa could take no more and sailed into exile.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_NewOrleans-History.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1
mbers 14 and 26 are still in their original state. [SEP] Number 10 was the home of film stars Simone Signoret and Yves Montand. [SEP] The huge Palais de Justice, heart of the centralized French legal system, stands on the site of the Roman palace where the Emperor Julian was crowned in 360. [SEP] Together with the Conciergerie (see page 30), it sprawls right across the Ile de la Cité. [SEP] Concealed in the courtyard between them is a Gothic masterpiece, the Sainte-Chapelle, whose fine proportions stand in sharp contrast to the ponderous palace. [SEP] The chapel was constructed in 1248 to house holy relics, fragments of what were believed to be Jesus’s Crown of Thorns and the True Cross, which pious Louis IX (later canonized as St. Louis) had bought from the Byzantine emperor. [SEP] Try to	arrive	as the chapel opens or at sunset (see page 39) and make your way to the upper level, where light blazes in through 15 stained-glass windows separated by buttresses so slim that there seems to be no wall at all. [SEP] Miraculously, of the 1,134 individual pieces of glass, 720 are 13th-century originals. [SEP] The chapel provides an exquisite setting for chamber music concerts. [SEP] Between 1789 and 1815 the chapel assumed various guises: a flour warehouse during the Revolution and a club for high-ranking dandies, then an archive for Napoléon’s Consulate. [SEP] It was this latter role that saved the chapel from projected destruction, since the bureaucrats could not think of another site in which to put their mountains of paper.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	1
Portalegre is the prosperous, no-nonsense capital of the northern Alentejo, located near the hills and neolithic monuments of the Serra de São Mamede, 59 km (36 miles) north of Estremoz. [SEP] Its past wealth, based on carpet and silk production, accounts for the graceful 18th-century mansions lining the Rua 19 de Junho. [SEP] By far the most interesting sight in town, though, is the Fábrica Real de Tapeçarias (Tapestry Factory), housed in a 17th-century Jesuit school, where dozens of women use great handlooms to weave carpets from thousands of different shades of wool. [SEP] Horse fans should be sure to visit Alter do Chão (33 km/20 miles southeast of Portalegre), the location of the Coudelaria de Alter Real (Royal Stud Farm), where Portugal’s finest horses are bred. [SEP] If you	arrive	in the morning you can watch the Lusitanian and Alter do Chão horses being fed. [SEP] There is also an interesting museum, and the town has a fine restored castle. [SEP] Flôr da Rosa and Crato are two small agricultural towns west of Portalegre. [SEP] In the former is one of the best examples of how the state pousada chain is adapting modern architecture to historic buildings. [SEP] The inn now occupying the 14th-century Convento de Flôr da Rosa is extraordinary. [SEP] Outside of town, on the road to Aldeia da Mata, is one of the best-preserved dolmens in Portugal, a mysterious prehistoric chamber sitting unobtrusively in rolling pastoral lands.

On the western flank of the square you’ll find the Museo del Niño (Children’s Museum). [SEP] No sterile display cases full of artifacts here! [SEP] This is an entertaining, hands-on activity center where kids can be kids and yet still have a learning experience. [SEP] There are four floors of interactive exhibits, including a real dentist’s chair where mom or dad can be examined by their offspring, and a giant bubble machine on the upper floor. [SEP] Behind the museum are a number of other important attractions. [SEP] Take Calle las Monjas toward San Juan Bay. [SEP] After a short distance you’ll	arrive	at the western wall and a small square, Plazuela de la Rogativa, with a bronze statue commemorating the torchlight religious procession, or rogativa, that saved the city in 1797.

While at La Guancha you may see groups of people across the narrow bay staring down into the water. [SEP] More likely than not, they’re trying to catch sight of the giant tarpon that have taken to swimming around in the shallows. [SEP] Hundreds of these fish — some are up to 7 ft (2 m) long — congregate here because they’ve learned they’ll be well supplied with tasty tidbits offered by the humans on shore. [SEP] North of Ponce are attractions of a different kind. [SEP] Take Route 503 out of town — this road runs along the banks of the Río Portuguéz — and after about a mile and a half (2 km) you’ll	arrive	at the Tibes Indian Ceremonial Park, one of the most important Amerindian archaeological sites in the Caribbean. [SEP] The ceremonial site and cemetery are across the river, and you may not enter without a guide. [SEP] A small museum explains the known history of the Amerindian races; it has a number of cabinets holding artifacts, as well as a skeleton, still in the traditional fetal burial position. [SEP] Once you’re into the park, the ceremonial grounds come into view. [SEP] Open spaces discovered since the 1960s are now believed to be used for “ball games,” which had an important though as yet only poorly understood ceremonial purpose in Indian culture. [SEP] High in the hills behind Ponce is Hacienda Buena Vista. [SEP] To get there, take Route 10, a major north-south artery.

[SEP] Heading west beyond La Parguera, you’ll need to use secondary roads, but these are in surprisingly good condition and relatively quiet. [SEP] It’s almost a pampas landscape here, with grassy slopes and horses galore. [SEP] Boquerón, a small village on the west coast, has arguably the most beautiful balneario (public beach) on Puerto Rico, a long arc of fine sand backed by sea grapes and palm trees.

[SEP] When the catches	arrive	, small temporary stalls are set up around the tiny town square. [SEP] You can buy fresh clams and oysters, which can be shucked for you to eat as you go.

The Nao trade route continued until the early 1800s, when José María Morelos y Pavón, a hero of Mexico’s War of Independence, took over Acapulco and stopped the trade, sending the town into a century-long respite, a hiatus that ended only when the Mexican government paved the highway between Mexico City and Acapulco. [SEP] The beautiful beaches of Acapulco Bay immediately lured Mexico City’s elite, and the metamorphosis began, from slumbering trading port into the “Pearl of the Pacific,” as the media came to know it in the 1930s. [SEP] The first airplanes from the US began to	arrive	in the mid-1930s, and with them came a bevy of notorious visitors, from movie stars to presidents, writers to millionaires. [SEP] Acapulco became the playground for the rich and famous. [SEP] Glitzy hotels went up in a hurry, supported by new boulevards, power plants, and a superhighway. [SEP] Acapulco’s peak was the 1940s to 1960s. [SEP] Celebrated images included Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner sipping margaritas while watching cliff divers at La Quebrada, President Eisenhower meeting Mexico’s President López Mateos for a summit conference in a new high rise hotel, and Johnny Weissmuller swimming laps in the Flamingos Hotel pool overlooking Acapulco Bay.
