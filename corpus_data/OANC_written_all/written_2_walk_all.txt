The Retail Forecasting Challenge<n>We first turn to the problem of forecasting sales in retail stores. Imagine trying to predict how many women will walk into a particular downtown Boston store next week prepared to pay $48 (full price) for a size-8 pair of Levi blue jeans, with “long” pant length, “loose” fit, stonewashed finish, and a pleated waist—in other words, one particular SKU out of thousands. How will that compare to the number who would buy the same product but with a “short” pant length? How does a retail buyer even begin to approach the problem of making forecasts at such a minute level of detail?<n>The buyer might start by trying to get historical data on the weekly sales of those Levi jeans in the store. But wait—should that be on the sales of those jeans throughout the Greater Boston area? Should the buyer base her prediction on sales of only this particular size and style or would it be more accurate to look at the sales of all jeans in this style and then multiply by the percent of all jean styles sold that were size-8 long? Maybe she should restrict herself to this year’s data to ensure that it is as current as possible. On the other hand, one would hate to lose the information that might be contained in past years’ selling patterns.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch6.txt
Let’s assume that the store’s demand for the size-8 Levi’s jeans last week can be described by the distribution in Figure 6.1. Let’s also assume that the average demand each week has been growing at a rate of about 1 percent, so that the average demand for the next week should be 10*(1.01) = 10.1 units, for the following week about 10*(1.01)2 = 10.2 units, and so on. Then the expected (average) demand is the solid black trend line shown in Figure 6.3.<n>The buyer could incorporate demand uncertainty into the forecast by indicating different possible values of demand, and the likelihood of that actual demand will fall within those values. For example, in Figure 6.3, the lines directly above and below the solid trend line indicate a range of demand for which the likelihood of demand falling within that range is 50 percent. The lines further from the trend line indicate the range with a likelihood of 90 percent. Thus, for week 1, there is a 90 percent probability that demand will be between two units and -seventeen units, exactly as depicted in Figure 6.1. Predicting what -customers will do when they walk into the store will always be challenging, but the buyer can be confident that if she stocks seventeen units at the beginning of the next week, she has a 95 percent probability of meeting all consumer demand on this product.<n>Forecasting Demand for New Products<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch6.txt
Without a nationally regulated and generously subsidized child-care system, formal child care in the United States is in much shorter supply and considerably more costly for parents than it is in other industrialized nations. And as our discussion in Chapter 6 will reveal, on the whole, the quality of American child care—whether center-based or home-based—is mediocre to abysmal.5 Indeed, so widespread is poor-quality child care in the United States that Americans have acclimated to it. In a recent survey of parents whose children were enrolled in several hundred randomly chosen child-care centers across four states, over 90 percent believed that their preschoolers’ experiences were far better than experts in early childhood development judged those experiences to be.6 Parents seemed unable to distinguish “good” from “substandard” care.<n>the “time bind.”  Like many parents, Angela, who raised the question of quality time, complains of being “torn in many directions.” Often she leaves work in a hurry in the late afternoon to pick up Victor and Jeannine from child care, dashes to Victor’s tumbling class or Jeannine’s piano lesson, then stops at the grocery store to pick up something for dinner. When Angela and her husband, Tom, walk through their front door, they typically head to the phone or fax machine to take care of unﬁnished work while trying to quell Victor and Jeannine’s hunger and irritability with a frozen dinner popped into the microwave and unlimited access to the TV set. Caught in a ceaseless sprint to reconcile job, marriage, and parenting, Angela and Tom feel drained at the end of the day—too tired to grant their children more than 10 or 15 minutes of focused time. When Victor and Jeannine do get their parents’ undivided attention, they are argumentative and unruly, compounding their parents’ fatigue and impatience.<n>Angela and Tom represent a growing number of American parents who try to pencil children into busy schedules, much like a business appointment. They love their children, but they also love and need their work, for personal and ﬁnancial reasons. Hence they ﬁnd themselves in a juggling act between the two, with work usually winning out. Tomorrow will be another day for the kids, they rationalize, but a business deal or a professional achievement, if not capitalized on at the moment, may evaporate. Their logic dovetails with the concept of “quality time” for children. In its commonly accepted meaning, quality time refers to an intense but brief contact. The term is a ready salve for the consciences of conﬂicted parents, who squeeze in a few moments with their children, catch-as-catch-can, yet sense deep down that they are robbing their youngsters—and themselves—of something vital.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
According to sociocultural theory, cooperative dialogues between children and more knowledgeable members of their society are necessary for children to acquire the ways of thinking and behaving that make up a community’s culture. These dialogues occur frequently and spontaneously as adults and children spend time together—in everyday situations such as household chores, mealtimes, play, storybook reading, outings in the community, and children’s eorts to acquire all sorts of skills. Although interactions that arise between adults and children may seem mundane and inconsequential at ﬁrst glance, sociocultural theory emphasizes that they are powerful sources of children’s learning.<n>Consider the following conversation between Mel and his 4-year-old son, Ben, as the pair took a summer-evening walk on a California beach near their home. Mel had brought along a plastic bag, as the beach was often littered with trash after a busy day.<n>Ben: (running ahead and calling out) Some bottles and cans. I’ll get them.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
Some researchers conjecture that growth of the cerebral cortex and other brain structures is necessary before children can store experiences in ways that permit them to be retrieved many years later.62 Similarly, several psychological explanations focus on changes in the nature of memory during the preschool years—from an unconscious, automatic, and nonverbal system to one that is conscious, deliberate, and verbal.63 Perhaps the second system cannot access events stored by the ﬁrst, making the earliest events of our lives forever irretrievable.<n>Yet the idea of vastly dierent approaches to remembering at young and older ages has been questioned. Children 1 1/2 to 3 years old can describe their memories verbally.64 And sometimes they even recall events that happened to them as preverbal infants! For example, while walking past a distinctive house with a fenced-in front yard, 22-month-old Lisa said to her mother, “Scary doggy!” Nine months earlier (before the child could talk), the family had taken the same walk. On that occasion, Lisa had seen a ferocious dog barking behind the chain-linked fence. Over time, neither the family walk nor the scary dog will be part of Lisa’s personally relevant memory. Yet the train trip across the country she will take at age 3 1/2 and her ﬁrst day of kindergarten at age 5 may still be memorable when she is 80.<n>A growing number of researchers believe that rather than a radical change in the way experience is coded into memory, two other milestones lead infantile amnesia to give way to memory for personally signiﬁcant experiences:<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
Muralismo (Mural Art)<n>The artistic movement of painting murals in Chicano barrios. The development of Chicano Muralismo grew out of the political context of the Chicano civil rights movement, a nationalistic political struggle waged by Chicanos during the 1960s. It imitated the Mexican mural art that was created during the postrevolutionary period of Mexico’s history, and was intended to promote political action and raise consciousness. In California the mural movement started about 1970. It involved a variety of interested individuals; as described by Alicia Gonzales, “The emergent Chicano Mural Movement brought together the self-taught artist, the sign-painter, the house painter, the mass-production painter from the billboard companies, the college art student, and the graffiti artist” (155). A statewide meeting of Chicano mural artists was held in September of 1974 as a means of developing cooperation and communication for the artists working throughout California. The early murals were considered public folk art because of the common themes of community and civil rights and because most of the murals were located in working-class neighborhoods and urban barrios. Often, these early murals were referred to as a people’s art. This concept was well expressed by a group of women artists in San Francisco who called themselves Mujeres Muralistas (women muralists). “Our interest as artists is to put art close to where it needs to be. Close to the children; close to the old people; close to everyone who has to walk or ride the buses to get places. We want our art either out in the streets or in places where a lot of people go each day, the hospitals, health centers, clinics, restaurants, and other public places” (Cockcroft, Weber, and Cockcroft, 107).<n>The scenes of many early Chicano murals consisted of pre-Columbian indigenous themes and motifs that reflected a mestizo (mixed-race) heritage and a Mexican cultural nationalism. Images of Aztlán, a concept from the pre--Conquest, and other Aztec symbols represented cultural pride and national loyalty. Chicano and Chicana artists turned to symbols that portrayed the traditions of Chicanos, traditions that distinguished them from mainstream American culture. These images can still be found in murals located in Chicano communities across the United States. Chicano muralists followed the tradition of the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Clemente Orozco, and used murals to rewrite the history of the Chicano experience. Murals were also intended to educate the community on the antiquity and ancestry of the Mexicano. What was not provided in textbooks and the classroom was flashed across walls in Chicano neighborhoods. The Chicano muralists sought to paint the history they knew, a history often based on “oral traditions, legends and myths” (Romo, 136).<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
Pinto is a term used for prison and also for a Chicano prison inmate. A pinto is a male prisoner, a pinta a female prisoner. La Pinta, referring to prison, is believed to come from the word penitenciaria, or “penitentiary.” Other common words for prison are bote, meaning “can,” and corre, which is short for “correctional institution,” referring specifically to one in Texas. “Joint” is another word frequently used to mean prison.<n>There has been a lot of sociological literature written about the formation of gangs in prisons as a means of surviving incarceration in the United States. The media, including 60 Minutes, has done stories about the activities of the Mexican mafia and La Familia. Often ignored is the subculture of the pinto experience that is exhibited in behavior, art expression, and published poetry. In the early 1970s several Chicano magazines devoted whole issues to literature and art by pintos, always referring to it as pinto art and pinto poetry. A combination of Mexican and prison cultural values dictates the behavior of pintos inside prison and out on the street. Chicano prisoners have a strong sense of family and community and feel they are constantly being watched by their barrio, family, women, and their home-boys peer group. Most Chicano convicts have little education, speak primarily in Spanish, and have a strong sense of Mexican nationalism. Regardless of place of birth, mexicanismo and machismo are a very important part of being a pinto. Ex-pintos are often identifiable by their mannerisms, gestures, language, haircuts, and dress. They are usually extremely clean and well groomed, have very short hair, wear well-pressed pants, and are in excellent physical shape. Within the prison world pintos have established a well-defined and -structured social environment, which they carry to the outside world when released. In discussing the film American Me, Rosa Linda Fregoso states that Edward James Olmos depicts extremely well the expressive behavior of pintos both in prison and outside. In her words, “Besides rendering a Chicano pinto presence in the rhythms of speech, Santana [the movie character] represents it in the stylized walk and prose of a pinto, a stance honed in the corridors behind prison walls or in the barrios of East L.A.” (1993, 130).<n>The pinto experience is a subculture of the Chicano experience. Because of the low socioeconomic status of a large percentage of Chicanos in the United States and the lack of equal opportunities in education and employment, many Chicano families have been inadvertently introduced to this subculture. A special issue of the Chicano magazine De Colores, vol. 3, no. 1, was devoted to “Los Pintos de America,” and the issue was published as a separate monograph in 1976 by Pajarito Publications. Female Chicana prisoners also undergo the pinta experience, and one scholar, Letticia Galindo, has written about the specialized language use and street experiences of pachucas, cholas, gang members, and female prison inmates.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt
But there is a third regime a phase transition away.<n>The survivable regime: Let the bromine fog drift lower. More and more peaks jut into the sunshine. At some point, some magical point, as more peaks emerge into the sunshine, quite suddenly, a hiker can walk all the way across the Alps in the sunshine.<n>This is a phase transition from the isolated peaks regime. A connected web  mathematically, a percolating web  of connected “solutions” has emerged suddenly as the fog lowers. Now consider hikers striding across the Alps, knapsacks and hearts full. If plate tectonics rather slowly deforms the landscape, then whenever hikers are about to be dipped into the lethal bromine fog, they can take a sideways step in some direction and remain in the sunshine.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
Now simple observation and experience tells you that you can put on your shirt and pants in either order, but you had better put on your socks before your shoes. In other words, some steps in life are permutable, others are not. Suppose in our job shop problem, a fixed fraction, P, of the steps in the construction of each of the O objects were jointly permutable. As P increases and more steps are permutable, the conflicting constraints in the total problem are reduced. But this in turn means that the entire space of solutions improves, that is, the entire space shifts toward lower makespan, or higher eciency.<n>And now the relation to the bromine fog metaphor can be stated clearly. As the number of permutable steps increases, the conflicting constraints are reduced. The entire makespan-eciency landscape is lifted higher, the peaks are higher, and the landscape, with fewer conflicting constraints, is smoother. All in all, the result is that the percolating web of solutions where the hikers can walk all across the Alps occurs at a higher eciency and shorter makespan.<n>In terms of Figure ., the capacity to permute steps in the job shop problem shifts the phase transition point leftward, toward shorter makespan. Equivalently, if one wants to shift the curve in Figure . to the left, purchase a computable number of machines that are polyfunctional so that the same machine can be used for more than one job. That too reduces conflicting constraints.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
The interior was different, with many hallmarks of the International Style: no decoration, bare concrete, exposed structural beams, factory sash glazing and steel pipe railings. I assumed that the stark simplicity was the result of a restricted budget, and a desire to use materials that would withstand wear and tear. It seemed pretty banal to me, and although I didn’t say anything to Jack, I was disappointed. Yet as we walked around, I changed my mind. Although the décor was tough and unsentimental, it was not crude. There were sleek stainless-steel pendant lighting fixtures with suspended glass diffusers and stylish easy chairs covered in canvas. In the food court, the bar and counter tops were marble, the dining tables solid maple. Students were gathered around tables, lounging on the staircase, sprawled on the floor. The atmosphere was hard to pin down. This was not the precious, corporate modernism of Richard Meier, nor the contrived, technological wizardry of Norman Foster. It was certainly not the Calvinist minimalism that I associated with many trendy younger architects. I couldn’t put my finger on it until I realized that the functional but chic décor reminded me of the no-nonsense styling of a Benetton clothing store.<n>I happen to like Collegiate Gothic buildings. I like their dark rooms with wood paneling, hammer-beam ceilings, and traditional oak furniture. But seeing the York student center made me realize that whenever I walk through these old buildings I also experience a nagging dissatisfaction. It has to do with the students. The young men and women in baseball caps, shorts, stenciled sweat shirts, and iridescent nylon windbreakers just don’t fit in. They should be wearing boaters and blazers, tweeds and flannels. Of course, no student that I have ever seen—including at Oxford—dresses that way. I may deplore the loss of decorum, but as an architect I can’t do anything to change it. It is the building that must do the accommodating.<n>If the relationship between dress and décor is intimate, it is also one-sided. Interior decorators and architects will bridle at this, but there is no doubt that dress comes first. “People have always worn what they wanted to wear,” writes Anne Hollander, “fashion exists to keep fulfilling that desire.”6 And architecture must follow. For the truth is that a building—no matter how useful or well built or beautiful—that is not sympathetic to the way that people dress risks looking not merely anachronistic, but downright silly. Like it or not, architecture cannot escape fashion.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch1.txt

The flower-lined road from Loulé to São Brás de Alportel, another market town and site of one of only two government pousadas (inns) along the Algarve, passes through rolling orchards of fig, olive, and orange trees. It’s best to visit the town on Saturday, when the lively market transforms its otherwise sleepy character. You may wish to pay a visit to the charming Museu Etnográfico do Trajo Algárvio (Museum of Algarvian Costumes), where exhibits of local dress are well staged in a large, old house 90 m (100 yards) or so off the main square.<n>In this northern part of the southern province, life is visibly slower and more rustic; bonneted ladies in black walk along the roadside, old men bounce up and down on donkeys, and families pluck almonds from the trees with long sticks.<n>On the road toward Faro is a pair of historical sights. The Palácio de Estói is a most curious find. The charming Rococo palace, found through a small side gate just to the left of the church steps in the town center, once belonged to the Dukes of Estói. Begun in the mid-18th century, in palatial terms, it’s rather small, abandoned and visibly dilapidated, and only the gardens are open to the public. Yet it is a spectacular sight. Its faded glory includes balustrade terraces and staircases with splendid bursts of bougainvillea, busts of historic characters impaled on the parapets, brightly colored wall tiles, and formal gardens. The palace and gardens have been acquired by the Portuguese government, which aims to construct a pousada (inn) here. If and when that project is completed, it should become one of the most interesting of the entire chain.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
Just down the hill, off Rua Galeria near the river, is the beautiful 16th-century Igreja da Misericórdia (Church of Mercy), a spectacular Renaissance edifice. The carved portico is especially fine, with a statue of Our Lady of Mercy under a canopy. The 18th-century interior contains excellent specimens of carved retables and tiles. There are at least two dozen other churches in Tavira; also worth a visit — though you may find them closed‚ — are the 13th-century Igreja de Santiago (St. James Church), near the castle walls, and the 17th-century Igreja de Sao Paulo (Church of St. Paul), across the river on Praça Dr. Padinha. The church, part of a former monastery, has a unique feature: the floor of the transept is paved with bricks and stones painted with Spanish figures.<n>Rua da Liberdade, Tavira’s main street, is lined with stately 16th-century mansions. A walk down any of the city’s old streets will reveal handsome details of noble houses, such as double windows and latticed doors. A lively fruit and vegetable market is held by the banks of the River Gilão, and it is well worth crossing the Roman bridge to view more of the town’s elegant houses and pretty flower-filled squares. Many of those houses have sloping triangular roofs, called tesouros (treasures).<n>A nice excursion from Tavira is to the nearby island Ilha de Tavira, where there is a huge and thoroughly appealing beach backed by sand dunes. Jetties leave from a point, Quatro Águas, a couple of km (one mile) east of town.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
The town square, Praça do Marquês do Pombal, is the work of the royal architect, and the tour de force of Vila Real. The pavement’s black and white wedges of stone radiate from an obelisk in the center of the square like rays from the sun. Distinguished three-story, late 18th-century houses line the square, and orange trees soften the edges, adding color and scent. Visit the small Manuel Cabanas Museum, just off the square, to see a nice collection of woodcuts that ranges from rustic scenes to famous statesmen and composers.<n>Today Vila Real is sleepy but quietly dignified. A walk around the old quarter reveals a number of fine, brightly painted houses along pedestrian-only streets. Vila Real de Santo António’s main appeal is as the ferry port to Ayamonte across the water in Spain. The trip takes just 20 minutes — less time than it would take to drive to and over the new bridge — and the white town of Ayamonte is a fine sight as you approach it from the river. Crossing into Spain, you will need to take your passport.<n>Excursion to Lisbon<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
Perched on the edge of the Bairro Alto is the Igreja do Carmo, devastated in the earthquake of 1755 but deliberately preserved as an atmospheric ruin and potent reminder of its impact. Nearby, the sumptuous, 16th-century Igreja de São Roque, features a small museum of sacred art.<n>You can walk to this area easily from the central squares, but it’s also fun to go by tram or instead to board the landmark 30-meter (98-foot) Elevador de Santa Justa, which you’ll find just off the Rossio square in the Baixa, the lower city. This 1902 Victorian marvel of iron and glass was built by Raul Mesnier. The longer, slower way back downhill meanders through the upmarket shopping area of Chiado, now totally rebuilt after a 1988 fire that swept through the district.<n>The Baixa is Lisbon’s principal business district. The main square is the Praça Dom Pedro IV, better known as the Rossio. Look out for the railway station, Estação do Rossio, which looks like a Moorish palace with horseshoe arches, just west of the square. Two blocks north is another lively square, Praça dos Restauradores, which leads to the leafy main thoroughfare, Avenida da Liberdade. The city plunges steeply downhill to the River Tagus and its most imposing square, Praça do Comércio, lined on three sides by gracious arcaded buildings and a vast triumphal arch. The grand square, wholly wiped out by the great earthquake of 1755, has seen its share of watershed political events: King Carlos and his son were felled by assassin’s bullets in the praça in 1908, and one of the first uprisings of the Carnation Revolution of 1974 was staged in this place.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
You will find several historical gems as you wander Walletjes. One of the narrow houses on Oudezijds Voorburgwal — number 40 — has a wonderful secret to share. Museum Amstrelkring was a merchant’s house bought by Catholic Jan Hartman in 1661. Following the Alteration in 1578 Catholics were not permitted to practice their religion, and Hartman — along with a number of other wealthy Catholics of the time — had a secret chapel built, where his family and friends could worship. Although they were common at the time, this is now the only secret chapel left in the city, and because of its location in the house is called “Our Lord in the Attic” or Ons’ Lieve Heer op Solder. Over its years of use as a church, three surrounding houses were added to create extra space, and several of the other rooms are furnished in authentic 18th-century style. It is a fascinating glimpse of a very difficult time in Amsterdam’s history, but it’s not just a museum piece — the church is still used for weddings.<n>Southeast of Oude Kerk you will walk through the small Chinese Quarter to reach Waag. This is one of the oldest buildings in the city and was opened in 1488 as a city gate, marking the eastern boundary of the city along the new wall built after the disastrous fire in the 1450s. The numerous turrets and rounded tower give it the look of a fairytale castle but it has had a more colorful history. Public executions were held here in the 16th century with the condemned being kept in a small cell on the ground floor before they met their fate. From the early 17th century it became the weigh house (the name Waaggebouw means “weigh house”) for cargoes entering or leaving the city down the Geldersekade Canal to its north. The upper-floor rooms were taken by various trades’ guilds for their meetings, and for one — the Guild of Surgeons — it was used for practical medical research, including experiments with cadavers. Rembrandt created two canvasses for the Guild of Surgeons, which have become two of his most famous paintings. The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Tulp and The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Diejman both show scenes from guild activities at the Waag and were hung here on their completion.<n>In the early 19th century the weigh house closed and Waag had a number of less illustrious tenants; it even spent some time as a furniture store. It now houses a café/bar, so you can have a refreshment and admire the impressive Gothic interior at the same time.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
In the early 19th century the weigh house closed and Waag had a number of less illustrious tenants; it even spent some time as a furniture store. It now houses a café/bar, so you can have a refreshment and admire the impressive Gothic interior at the same time.<n>Nieuwmarkt (New Market) surrounds the Waag and it is home to several different types of market throughout the week. If you walk to the north side of the Waag and look up the Gelderskade you will see a tower dominating the skyline. This is Schreierstoren, also part of the new city wall of 1480. City scholars are divided as to the reason for the tower’s name. Some say it comes from the word schreien which means “weeping” as it was a place where sailors’ weeping wives came to wave their men off to sea. Other say that the name is a derivation of scherpe, which means “sharp” — denoting the towers position on a 90-degree bend in the wall.<n>From Waag walk down Sint Antoniesbreestraat, past modern apartment blocks built for the workers of the city in the 1970s. On your right you will see the ornate tower of Zuiderkerk (South Church). This church was the first place of worship to be built following the Reformation and was begun in 1603. Designed by Hendrick de Keyser, its lines were much admired by Sir Christopher Wren, architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. It was de-consecrated in 1929 and is now a community information center.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt

You’ll find an old house, now a small bar/café, in the foreground and, in the background, the tower of Montelbaanstoren. Built as part of a new outer defensive wall in 1512 it originally had a flat roof — the ornate peak giving it such panache was added by de Keyser later in 1606. Today it is used by the local Water Authority as an office building.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Travel further along Herengracht to the end of the second block. Here you will find one of the most fascinating views of the canal ring. From the bridge it is possible to see 14 other bridges by looking up and down Herengracht and ahead down the adjoining Reguliersgracht (this view is even better at water level, so take a canal cruise — and your camera!). Reguliersgracht has some very pretty houses and is quieter than the main three “girdle” canals built at this time.<n>The small square here is Thorbeckeplein and you will see a suitably somber statue of Johan Rudolf Thorbecke who designed the Dutch constitution in 1848. Wander through the square, which hosts an art market on Sundays, to reach Rembrandtsplein, one of the city’s most vibrant social centers. Before 1878 this square was called Botermarkt, (a butter market was held here in the 19th century) but the square was renamed after the large statue of Rembrandt was sited here. One wonders what he would have made of the square, for since the statue was unveiled, it has attracted theaters, cinemas, clubs, and show halls, along with a plethora of bars and restaurants and a curtain of vibrant neon signs all around the façade. On a summer evening it is one of the best places to sit with a drink and watch the world go by, and is within easy reach of a romantic walk along the canalsides.<n>Beyond the eastern end of Waterlooplein you will see the Visserplein, busy with several lanes of traffic. Head across the square to Weesperstraat to find the Joods Historisch Museum (Jewish Historical Museum) which documents the history of the once large and influential Jewish community in the city. Jewish history dates back to the late 16th century, but was cut short by the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam in 1940. The systematic deportation of the Jewish population to concentration camps destroyed the community and after the war only a handful of the thousands forced to leave returned to their homes.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
The Botanical Gardens have a long and illustrious history. They began as a small medicinal garden in 1682, but soon became the depository for many of the new plant species brought from Dutch colonies in the Golden Age and were responsible for developing each genus for cultivation, propagation and commercial exploitation. The distinctive glass houses were added in 1912, and today the gardens have one of the largest collections in the world.<n>A two-minute walk down Plantage Middenlaan (Plantage Middle Road) leads you to Artis, a fascinating complex of zoo, aquarium, planetarium, and Geological Museum which aims to increase your knowledge of the physical world. The zoo was one of the first in Europe when it opened its doors in 1838, and it has continued as a groundbreaking institution, now acting as a center for efforts to save several endangered species of animals.<n>Many of the old and confined Victorian enclosures where the animals were kept have been redeveloped in the 1990s to create more fitting environments for their majestic and healthy-looking animals. The Planetarium and other areas of Artis offer fun ways to learn about the world around us and are entertaining for adults and children alike.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Some inhabitants get a bird’s eye view of Artis zoo — imagine looking out of your apartment window on a rainy Amsterdam day and seeing a small herd of grazing zebra.<n>Walk north through Entrepodok and you will reach the main route of Prinse Henrikkade which runs along the northern edge of the city (this would lead you back to central station if you turned left). Cross the bridge of the Nieuwe Vaart canal and walk towards a large square building with a masted sail ship docked outside. This is The Scheepvaartmuseum (The National Maritime Museum). As you cross the bridge, look left for a glimpse of the only windmill left in the city’s central area. The De Gooyer windmill was built in the early part of the 18th century to grind corn.<n>The building housing The Scheepvaartmuseum was built in 1656 for the Dutch navy. Its strong walls safeguarded a vast arsenal used to protect Dutch interests around the known world. Today its extensive exhibits document the long and illustrious history of maritime achievement by the Dutch, with paintings, maps, and maritime models explaining the part that ships — and particularly the VOC — played in the growth of the empire in the 17th century.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Turn left once through Leidseplein and across the Singelgracht canal, and you will find the Amsterdam Casino and Lido on your left. On your right, across Stadhouderskade, is a narrow gate leading to Vondelpark. This park, founded in 1865, has been called “the lungs of Amsterdam” and was founded after a number of philanthropic city fathers decided that there was a need for a genteel recreation area for the city’s population, many of whom lived in overcrowded slums. The park was named after the Netherlands’ premier poet Joost van den Vondel and designed in the English fashion of the times. Today its 46 hectares (120 acres) have grazing farm animals, flocks of parakeets, jogging tracks, and cycle paths. It is the perfect place for a picnic on a summer’s day. The large pavilion, which opened in 1881, was restored and refurbished in 1991 and reopened as the Nederlands Filmmuseum. It now shows more than 1000 films each year including many outdoor screenings and other artistic performances in the summer.<n>Only five minutes to the south of Leidseplein is the museum quarter, for many visitors the raison d’être for their visit to Amsterdam. Here, three of the most important art collections in Europe sit side by side, allowing visitors to walk from one to the next in a matter of moments. Although all very different in appearance, they are brought together by an open space which has recently been redesigned and replanted to accent the buildings. The square is called, not surprisingly, Museumplein.<n>The Rijksmuseum<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
If you feel exhausted after your “museum-fest,” then the streets around the Museumplein offer some exciting retail therapy. Walk across Paulus Potterstraat from the Van Gogh Museum and you will find Coster Diamonds, one of the oldest “houses” in the city, where you can watch diamonds being polished and maybe buy a carat or two. Van Baerlstraat, bordering the west side of Museumplein, is the haute couture area of the city. For further culture of a musical nature the Concertgebouw on Van Bearlstraat is home to the orchestra of the same name. The main auditorium is considered to have almost perfect acoustics even though the designer of the building, Van Gendt, had no experience in this specialized area.<n>If you want to stroll back to town after your visit to the museums then walk through the open courtyard which cuts through the center of the Rijksmuseum, across Stadouderskade and on to the narrow street of Nieuwe Speigalstraat. This center of antique and art galleries has some wonderful windows to gaze into. Prices are said to be on the high side, but the dealers are some of the most experienced in the world and they are sure to give you good advice.<n>Walk north along the whole length of Nieuwe Speigalstraat and you will eventually reach Herengracht at its most spectacular point. When it was first dug, and the lots of land sold, it was soon realized that this section of the canal (between Vijzelstraat and Leidsestraat) would have the largest houses inhabited by the richest families in the city. For this reason it has become known as the “Golden Bend.” Many of these buildings now house banks and financial institutions.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Behind the Begijnhof is the old Convent of St. Lucian, which became the city orphanage after the Alteration, although it was only open to well-to-do orphans; the poor had to fend for themselves. Extended several times, including a wing designed by de Keyser, it was opened as the Amsterdam Historical Museum in 1975 and its rooms reveal the details of the development of this fascinating city. You’ll see plans, maps, and paintings depicting the streets and canals as they were when just completed. The Golden Age is brought to life (rooms 5–15) but there is also an interesting section on 20th-century Amsterdam, the Nazi occupation, and efforts to protect and preserve the city. Tiny details, such as the relief above the Kalverstraat entrance which asks people to support the upkeep of the orphanage, also point to the museum’s original purpose.<n>Once out of the museum, walk north. Take Kalverstraat, or if you find it a little too busy for comfort, take Rokin which runs parallel to Kalverstraat to the right. This wide street was once also a canal, which was drained and filled in to allow better access for modern forms of transport. On the far side of the canal you will see the elegant Georgian façade of the Allard Pierson Museum, the archaeological collection for the city. Another couple of minutes strolling will bring you to Dam Square (simply called Dam by Amsterdammers), the symbolic heart of the city.<n>Dam is a wide cobbled square, usually filled with people and pigeons, and dominated by the ornate façade of the Koninklijk Paleis (Royal Palace) which dates from 1655. It was originally built as the Town Hall, facing the landing wharfs of the Damrak, which would at that time have been busy with ships. The classical design, by Jacob van Campen gives some indication of the confidence of the city in the Golden Age — a statue of Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders sits astride the rear of the building, and in the sumptuous interior, only the best materials were used. When Louis Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon, became King of Holland in 1806, he demanded a palace suitable for his position and requisitioned the Town Hall. He furnished it with the finest pieces of the time and left them all behind only four years later when he was forced out of power. It has remained a Royal Palace ever since but it is not a royal residence à la Buckingham Palace in London, and is only used for ceremonial occasions. It is possible to visit the palace in summer if there are no official activities taking place.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Just 5 km (2.75 miles) beyond Monnickendam is the community of Marken, one of the most beautiful villages in the Netherlands and home to a community of Calvinist Dutch whose traditions reach back hundreds of years. The older inhabitants of this close-knit community still wear traditional Dutch costume as everyday wear.<n>Until 1957 the village was situated on an island, remote from the outside world. The opening of a roadway linking the village to the mainland brought many changes for the inhabitants. Today Marken welcomes visitors but not their cars, which must be left in a large car park on the outskirts. You can walk through the village with its traditional painted wooden houses to the picture-perfect port. Stop at the tiny museum on the quayside, which holds an eclectic mix of seafaring and fishing memorabilia.<n>Traveling from Monnickendam to Marken, the road leads out into open water, home to hundreds of thousands of birds in the summer. The native herons, ducks, and moorhens see many species of migratory birds who fly north for the summer and return south as winter approaches. The road also makes for good cycling, being flat and smooth, or for walking. Head out towards the old lighthouse which sits surrounded by water on a lonely promontory.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Eventually it was used as a powder magazine. In September 1687 Venetian forces threatened Athens and one of their mortars hit the Parthenon, igniting the powder inside. The resulting explosion badly damaged the structure and many other ancient buildings on the site. The center of the Parthenon was totally destroyed along with many columns and priceless carved friezes. Subsequent “licences” granted by the Ottomans to European nobles saw many prize friezes disappear to archaeological collections around Europe, including the Elgin marbles (ornately carved pediments) that were taken to London by Lord Elgin. Restoration of the temple has been almost constant since 1834.<n>Today it is not possible to walk among the columns and through what remains of the inner temple. This echoes the rules of ancient Greece, when only the highest priests could enter the cella. There they would be able to worship an ivory-and- gold-covered wooden statue of Athena said to be 12 m (39 ft) high which has long since been lost. Walk around the 70 m (228 ft) by 30 m (101 ft) exterior to really appreciate the grace of the columns. There are no straight lines anywhere in the building — the graduated curves simply create the illusion of the vertical and horizontal.<n>To the north of the Parthenon stand the graceful statues of the Porch of the Caryatids, which adorn the southern façade of the Erechtheíon. This temple is an unusual mélange of architectural styles, with rooms at varying levels, where the worship of three gods took place. It was the last of the great building flurry of Pericles to be finished, dedicated in 406 b.c. Built beside an ancient Temple of Athena whose scant remains can just be seen, the Erechtheíon brought together the worship of Athena and Poseidon under one roof — legend says that following the contest between the two gods for the honor of protecting Athens, they were reconciled and this dual temple recognized their special bond with regard to the city. Erechtheus — part man, part snake — was a legendary King of Athens who, over the generations, became closely connected with Poseidon. A temple of Zeus also forms part of the complex. The temple was damaged by fire almost immediately, and again during the Roman period. It was converted into a church in the sixth century a.d. and was used as a harem building during Ottoman times.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
The eastern flank of the Agora site is dominated by the Stoa of Attalos. First erected by King Attalos of Pergamon and opened in 138 b.c., it was faithfully recreated during the 1950s to offer us a stunning vision of what communal buildings were like in ancient times. Stoas were extremely popular in the Roman era and all large settlements had one. These long porches or porticos provided shade in summer and shelter in winter and they were often used to link important community buildings. The Stoa of Attalos was a two-story construction with rooms at the back that housed small shops. Today it is home to the Agora Museum and displays numerous artifacts found at this extensive sight. Here you’ll find a range of everyday objects not seen in the Acropolis Museum, in addition to religious and civic statuary and mosaics.<n>The route of the great “sacred way” that linked the Agora with the Acropolis above — and that was used during the Panathenaic Festival — is now being excavated and rebuilt to allow visitors to walk in the footsteps of the ancient Athenians.<n>Monastiráki and Thissio<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
The main thoroughfare cutting through the district is Odós Ermou, which leads east to Syntagma Square (see page 55). Ermou is one of the main shopping streets of the city, and numerous European retailers have outlets here. A small square cuts its path just a little way from Monastiráki Square, and it is decorated with the beautiful Byzantine church of Kapnikaréa, the official church of Athens University. Built in the 11th century its dome is supported by four Roman columns and its modern frescoes were created in the 1950s by Fotis Kondoglou. Kapnikaréa was earmarked for demolition in the 1830s but was saved by the personal intervention of Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, father of Greece’s first king.<n>We’ll take the route west from Monastiráki Square, as if leaving the city. This leads us one kilometer (.62 miles) to the archaeological site of Kerameikós. As you walk along, immediately to the north of Ermou (on your right) is the district of Psirí. Unspoiled by tourism, there is a very Greek atmosphere in the maze of narrow streets and some excellent tavernas among its traditional shops.<n>The excavated area of Kerameikós is interesting because it incorporates a section of the 478 b.c. city wall and the ceremonial entranceways into Athens from the cities of Eleusis to the west and Piraeus to the south. The Panathenian Festival Procession would start from here on its journey to the Acropolis, and the procession of the Eleusian Mysteries would leave from here through the Sacred Gate and along the Sacred Way. The most important building found here is the Pompeion, where procession paraphernalia was stored and where those involved in major processions would ready themselves.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
Omonia Square (PlateÌa Omónias)<n>From Monastiráki Station take the straight thoroughfare of Athinas to Omonia Square (Omonia means Concord), the commercial heart of the modern city. As you walk you’ll pass through the Municipal Market area of Athens where the streets buzz with constant activity; goods spill out onto walls and alleyways; and people throng the sidewalks. The market operates from early morning to mid afternoon. You’ll also pass Plateía Dimarkíou, also known as Plateía Kotziá where you’ll find several fine Neo-Classical buildings including the Melá Mansion (1884), now a Bank of Greece building. The center of the square has benefited from archaeological exploration during the 1980s and Athens Town Hall is on the left flank as you almost reach Omonia Square.<n>The rather shabby modern buildings belie Omonia’s importance. It’s always busy with people; there are some good cafés and restaurants, and some of the most prestigious companies have offices here. Combine this with the bus and Metro routes that run through it, and you have a major city hub.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
The National Archaeological Museum<n>A ten-minute walk north of the square on Odós Patission is the National Archaeological Museum, one of the most prestigious archaeological collections in the world. Finds cover 7,000 years of Greek history, and have been brought from sites all across Greece. The collection brings the ancient Greek world to life shedding light on almost every aspect of the daily activities of the citizens. Prepare to spend at least two hours here, don’t try and rush this amazing collection. The map of the museum issued with your ticket will be a great help in finding your way around the somewhat confusing array of rooms and corridors. You are sure to find your own favorites, but here are a few acknowledged highlights.<n>In the prehistoric collection (rooms 3–6) enjoy the treasure-trove found at Mycenae, including the exquisite, gold Mask of Agamemnon. Schiemann thought that this was placed over the face of the dead King Agamemnon around 1200 b.c., but in fact it dates from over 300 years earlier; the prehistoric rooms also have a collection of Cycladic figures dating from the third millennium b.c. The simple, rounded female figures were funerary or religious objects and are in total contrast to the intricate pediment and frieze carvings and religious statuary found at temples on the Acropolis and in the Acropolis Museum. You’ll also see a rare male figure among the collection, and the beautiful Harp Player — a more complex carving in the same style.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt

You’ll also see a rare male figure among the collection, and the beautiful Harp Player — a more complex carving in the same style.<n>Rooms 7–35 concentrate on sculpture — perhaps the greatest collection of ancient sculpture in the world — and these are displayed to show the chronological development of the art form. Simply styled male and female figures (kouros and kore) of the Achaiac Age (seventh–fifth century b.c.) give way to more ornate and literal human forms as you walk through the collection into the Classical Age and then on to the Hellenistic and Roman eras. Greek gods are popular themes, followed by eminent human figures of Roman times. Room 7 holds the important early statue of Artemis by Nikandre of Naxos (c640 b.c.).<n>Room 15 is dominated by a fine statue of Poseidon in bronze (460 b.c.) found in the sea off the island of Euboea. The god is set to launch his trident against foes unknown. The Hall of the Stairs hosts another statue dredged from the sea, that of the Jockey of the Artemision. The diminutive jockey drives on the handsome steed which has its two front legs raised into the air, as if about to leap over an invisible obstacle.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
Behind Evangelismos Metro statio, and next door to the Hilton Hotel is the National Gallery. The original compilation was boosted in the 1880s by a large bequest by art collector Aléxandros Soútzos, but the two collections were only brought together in this gallery in 1976. Much of the permanent collection comprises 19th- and 20th-century Greek art and post-Byzantine icons, though you can also find works by El Greco, Picasso, and Delacroix.<n>From the National Gallery it is just a short walk past the Hilton Hotel along Vas. Sofias to the Megaron, a vast new national auditorium and concert hall now holding regular theatrical and musical performances. Look for a dramatic modern sculpture in glass depicting a human figure running at an extremely high speed (or blown by the wind) that graces the main intersection here.<n>Lycabettus and Kolonaki<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
Lycabettus and Kolonaki<n>To the west of the bare sheer rock of the Acropolis is a rival hill — the verdant pine-clad Lycabettus, which makes an inviting diversion from the archaeological sites of the city. Here you’ll be able to sit in shade and listen to the birds. The hill was never settled in ancient times because there was no water supply. You can reach the upper slopes by funicular. When you reach the top station, walk to the small chapels of Ayios Isidoros and Ayios Georgios — center of the Easter celebrations for the city — a modern amphitheater for summer performances, and wonderful views across Athens where major attractions are pointed out on marble panoramas. Though there are fixed telescopes here, having your own binoculars is a boon to really take in the detail.<n>Surrounding the lower slopes of Lycabettus on the south and west sides is Kolonaki, perhaps the most fashionable district of central Athens. Apartments and houses here are much sought after as they sit among chic boutiques, designer stores, restaurants, and bars. It is one of the best parts of the city to eat out in the evening with a range of good international eateries in addition to traditional Greek tavernas.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
North from Zea harbor is another pretty harbor, Mikrolimani (Small Harbor) or Tourkolimani, where you’ll find the fishing fleet and some good fish tavernas. Or head south towards the main historical attractions of Piraeus.<n>From the south side of Zea harbor it is only a short walk to the Archaeological Museum of Piraeus. The rather dour building hides a treasure-trove of statuary and other artifacts found during excavation of the ancient shrines of the city, and communal buildings such as the Agora. Pride of place goes to the Piraeus Kouros, the oldest full-size bronze figure depicting the god Apollo. On the grounds of the museum are scant remains of the ancient Theater of Zea.<n>Walking further south along the promenade past remnants of the ancient sea wall brings you to another small bay where you will find the Hellenic Maritime Museum, a semicircular museum with small garden in front complete with cannon. Rooms display an eclectic series of artifacts with dioramas of the great Battle of Salamis in 480 b.c., letters from the naval heroes of Greek independence, and numerous items salvaged from the seas around the Attica coastline.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
Athens has a beautiful downtown area but it is one of the largest cities in Europe, and it also has an industrial element mostly based around the southern and eastern suburbs. Incongruous among the landscapes of oil refineries and factories you’ll find historical gems to explore. Ten kilometers (6 miles) west of Athens is the Monastery of Daphni (soon to be linked with the downtown area by Metro extension) built on the site of an earlier Temple of Apollo. Founded in the fifth or sixth century a.d., the site was refurbished and extended in the 11th century but sacked and abandoned before being occupied by Orthodox monks in the 16th century. Restoration took place after WWII and again in the 1960s. The pretty Byzantine church (c1080) has a stone-and-tile dome exterior but is famed throughout Greece for the fantastic mosaics that decorate the interior, particularly that of Christ Pantocrator in the main dome.<n>Through this same industrial area runs the Sacred Way that linked Athens with the city of Eleusis. In ancient times the way was lined with shrines and tombs, which are now and again brought to light when redevelopment takes place. Eleusis was home to the Sanctuary of Demeter and the Eleusian Mysteries — a series of complex and enigmatic rituals only performed by initiates of the order. The order thrived from the Mycenaean era to the coming of Christianity. Annual celebrations to Demeter took place in Athens each September, with a public festival and a secret religious rite that transformed chosen followers into initiates of the secrets. A procession would leave Eleusis and walk along the Sacred Way entering Athens via the Sacred Gate at Kerameikos (see page 49) before proceeding to the Acropolis.<n>In Eleusis the sacred way led directly to the Sanctuary of Demeter and a large Temple of Artemis with a forecourt where the initiates would gather in preparation for the procession. A great Propylaia marked the entrance to the town  — a copy of that at the Acropolis. The Precinct of Demeter lay in a walled complex, and its inner sanctum, the Periklean Telesterion, where only initiates were allowed to enter, sat within the temple. You will also find the remains of more mundane structures such as the Bouleuterion and gymnasium. A museum on site displays extremely good artifacts found among the ruins.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
Vendue House, at the western end of Bay Street, at the corner of George Street, was once the site of the Nassau slave auction. It now houses the Pompey Museum of Slavery and Emancipation. The pale pink stone house is unassuming, but the interior tells of the plight of slaves on the islands and of the positive work that was undertaken in the years following emancipation.<n>The Pirates of Nassau attraction at the corner of George and Marlborough Streets brings to life the dramatic and exciting world of the pirates. The building itself dates from the 18th century; the attraction inside recreates the Nassau quayside of the 17th century. A three-quarter-size French corvette ship and quayside buildings have been stunningly brought to life. As you walk along the “dock,” costumed staff act out the roles of shipmate and pirate and regale you with tales of their everyday lives and deeds. Visitors then step inside the 75-ft- (23-m-) long vessel to examine the paraphernalia of the pirate’s trade that line the corridors and decks. Treasure chests mix with rum casks, and pirates tell of their lives at sea in the lonely and dangerous times. Listen to the groaning of injured pirates and witness the rudimentary and unsanitary surgical techniques that led to so many deaths — the ship’s carpenter doubled as surgeon. Read about the crew’s diet of “salmagundi,” a stew of pickled herrings, meat, and eggs mixed with wine and vinegar, which served to both preserve the protein and disguise the taste. Battle scenes are vividly recreated, and visitors find out the truth about what finally became of some of the most famous pirates.<n>The next street to the west is Blue Hill Road. About 1,640 ft (500 m) south of Shirley Street, opposite Graycliff Mansion, stands Government House, the official residence of the Governor-General, painted in the same shade of pink as the buildings of Parliament Square. At the north gate is a statue of Christopher Columbus in a rather dashing pose reminiscent of Errol Flynn in one of his swashbuckling films. Once every two weeks there is a solemn Changing of the Guard parade, similar to the one at Buckingham Palace in London, performed to the accompaniment of the Police Band. On the last Friday of the month from January to June all visitors to the island are invited to attend a huge tea party on the grounds.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
An airport north of Treasure Cay serves the resort and the northern offshore cays. A regular ferry service links with the flight times. Twenty minutes offshore is Green Turtle Cay. Much more lush than many of the other islands in the Bahamas, this hilly, 3-mile- (5-km-) long cay is covered with pine woodland that camouflages many of its houses and resorts. A Loyalist settlement dating from 1783 — groups of colonists were evacuated from Savannah and Charleston along with black slaves who escaped their owners — Green Turtle in recent years has become a getaway for the rich and famous. The hotels here have all the luxuries you could ever need, yet you might feel as if you’re a million miles away from the worries of the world. The cay is small enough to explore on foot but most people choose to rent a golf cart or bicycle (your hotel can make the arrangements).<n>New Plymouth is the largest town on the cay. It really has only one main route, Parliament Street, which is full of trim and brightly painted wooden homes with picket fences. As you walk down the street you’ll hear the sounds of daily activity floating through the open windows, occasionally a radio station with news, or maybe evangelical songs. You can browse in the general stores and souvenir shops or visit one of the small art galleries that sell original works and prints by local artists. On the left as you walk away from the harbor you’ll find the Memorial Sculpture Garden, dedicated to the brave settlers who founded New Plymouth. A little farther along, on the right, the Albert Lowe Museum, in an 18th-century house, is brim full of artifacts and knickknacks, maps, and newspaper articles that tell the story of New Plymouth. Lowe was a sailor and prominent shipbuilder. The house is now owned by Roland Alton Lowe, a descendant of Albert and an acclaimed Bahamian painter; his paintings and prints are sold at the museum. Abaco Gold necklaces, bracelets, and rings — including some with turtle and conch shell motifs — are sold at the Sand Dollar Shoppe on Parliament Street (Tel. 365-4221).<n>Eleuthera<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
Bay Street runs along the harbor-front, where you’ll find a small straw market — five or six colorful stalls hugging the beach — and the tourist office at the end of the jetty. Wandering around (you can stroll over the entire island in a few hours) you’ll find the Loyalist Cottage, a late-18th-century settler’s home, as well as several simple churches, including the oldest Anglican church in the Bahamas, St. John’s. A number of souvenir shops in the houses have some interesting Bahamian and European gifts.<n>The beautiful pink sand beach on the Atlantic side of the island is also a big draw. The five miles of sand are a beautiful sight, especially in the early morning or just before sunset when the color reflects more deeply. Any of the several luxury hotels tucked just behind the dunes make a good base for the beach or the delights of the town, only a few minutes’ walk away.<n>Just off the northern tip of Eleuthera is Spanish Wells. In the 16th century the Spaniards sank a well here to supply their treasure fleets with fresh water for the long journey back across the Atlantic. The people of Spanish Wells are noted seamen and farmers (they were given land to farm on the main island in the 18th century); many still make their living by fishing for crawfish, grouper, yellowtail, and conch, or by building boats, though the best-known local product is perhaps the wide-brimmed Spanish Wells straw hat. Not as much a tourist resort as Harbour Island, this quiet settlement nevertheless attracts visitors with its beaches, marina, and miles of offshore reef, particularly good for diving. The Spanish Wells Museum (open Mon–Sat 10am–12pm and 1–3pm) records the island’s history and culture.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
Many visitors come to this island, named after an English sea captain called Catt, for its beautiful quiet beaches. Fernandez Bay, with its arc of fine sand on the protected western side of the island, is said to be the finest in the Bahamas, and the nearby beach at Old Bight is not far behind in terms of beauty. Though you can’t go wrong anywhere on the western coast.<n>Mount Alvernia, in the center of the island, is not far from the airfield at New Bight. This settlement originally served as a hermitage for Father Jerome, an Anglican missionary who had converted to Catholicism and become an influential churchman on the Out Islands, responsible for the erection of a number of Catholic Churches. Father Jerome built a small Hermitage on the heights of Mount Alvernia that you’ll see as you reach the summit (a 15-minute walk from a rudimentary car park); the missionary was buried in a small hilltop cave here upon his death in 1956 at the age of 80. A more recent famous Cat Islander is the actor Sidney Poitier, who was born in Arthur’s Town in the north. He is now non-resident Bahamian Ambassador to Japan.<n>San Salvador<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
Long Island’s one main road runs like a backbone down its length. This highway creates an artificial divide between the two very different coastlines. In the east, the Atlantic Ocean crashes against cliffs of coral. In the west, the gentle seas lap shallow sand banks that stretch towards the southern Exumas.<n>Traveling south from Stella Maris you’ll pass uninhabited mangrove swamps on the way to the small town of Simms, an unhurried old settlement known for its distinctive straw-work, which craftswomen are delighted to show visitors. At Deadman’s Cay you’ll find an extensive cave system with faded Lucayan rock drawings. After passing small pineapple and banana plantations, you’ll reach attractive Clarence Town, with its two large churches — one Anglican, the other Roman Catholic — built by Cat Island hermit architect Father Jerome. The blue hole at nearby Turtle Cove, a half-mile walk from the road over rough terrain, provides a memorable diving experience, though it’s interesting even from the rim. The hole is about 80 yards (73 m) across and at least 600 ft (183 m) deep; you’ll sometimes see large turtles and tarpon in the waters.<n>Crooked Island and Acklins Island<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
In atmosphere, Sanur falls somewhere between the brash, noisy Kuta and secluded, pricey Nusa Dua. Half-hidden by tropical gardens and foliage, many of Sanur’s hotels are small in scale, and face the pleasant, sandy beach. The water is generally calm, protected from waves and undercurrents by an outlying coral reef. At high tide, the swimming is wonderful, but at low tide, the water dips to knee or waist level, and wading is the only activity possible. Beyond the reef are massive pounding waves, a challenge for experienced surfers.<n>Just inland, parallel to the beach, the town of Sanur looks at first like nothing more than a long strip of souvenir shops, clothing boutiques, and restaurants. But take a walk along some of the lanes leading off the main road, Jalan Tanjung Sari, or beyond the impatient traffic of the bypass (Jalan Bypass) and you’ll find traditional life still going on as if tourism had never happened. Many small Indonesian and seafood restaurants on the street are pleasant; one or two are outstanding. Sanur hotels provide the best top-bracket dining.<n>Only a short walk north along the shore from the ten-story Grand Bali Beach Hotel is the Le Mayeur Museum, once the house of the Belgian painter, Adrien Jean Le Mayeur. He came to Bali in 1932 and stayed to marry the beautiful Ni Pollok, who had been a well-known legong dancer (see page 88) before retiring (at 14!) to teach dance. In its day, the garden with its ponds and statues was open on the seaward side; now it is fully enclosed. The outside of the house is covered with stone carvings while the interior is a gallery of sculpture collected by Le Mayeur. The walls are hung with his own paintings: European landscapes, Balinese scenes, and studies of dancers, including Ni Pollok. When Le Mayeur died in 1958, the house was turned into a museum that his widow ran until her death in 1985.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt

Once a magnet for foreign artists and still home to some, Ubud and the cluster of villages around it form the cultural and artistic focus of Bali. An increasing number of visitors come on day trips from the coastal resorts, but a better plan is to stay overnight or longer. There’s a wide choice of accommodations, ranging from cheap homestays and charming middle range hotels to high-priced luxury hideaways in the countryside just outside Ubud.<n>Day trippers only get to see the commercialism and chaos in Ubud’s main streets. Just a short walk away, however, you’re among the green, peaceful rice terraces and jungle-filled river gorges that have captivated Bali’s visitors for decades and are so much a part of the region’s legendary mystique.<n>For schedules of dance performances and other events in the vicinity, pay an early visit to the Bina Wisata information office on Jalan Raya. Excellent, very inexpensive performances of traditional dance are offered in the atmospheric compound beside the palace in the center of town. In addition to its many shops, markets, and galleries, Ubud is home to a number of interesting museums.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Peliatan is known for its dances and gamelan music as well as painting and carving — “parasite carvings” (see page 92) are a recent specialty. The Agung Rai Gallery sells some of the best and most expensive modern Balinese paintings.<n>At Pengosekan, just a short walk farther south, the painters concentrate on images of birds and butterflies in idyllic “Garden of Eden” landscapes. The recently opened Agung Rai Museum of Art displays Indonesian and European paintings.<n>East of Ubud<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
The beaches west of Singaraja began to attract escapist travelers in the early 1970s, and simple and fairly inexpensive accommodations were built to house them. Slowly the number of visitors grew and the small homestays turned themselves into larger bungalow-type hotels. Today, tour groups come for short stays and, as everywhere in Bali, standards and prices are steadily going up. Actually, Lovina is not one village but a string of small ones, starting 6 km (4 miles) west of Singaraja and continuing for 10 km (6 miles) up the coast road. Shops, restaurants, and moneychangers are scattered along the busy stretch.<n>The beach itself is shallow and gently shelving, making it an ideal place for small children. There is calm water on the inside of the reef and good snorkeling over it. Lovina’s dark sand is less inviting than the white or golden variety at the southern resorts, and gets too hot to walk on in bare feet in the middle of the day.<n>Dawn and dusk are the best times for the beach. Dolphins frolic offshore almost every morning — boats will take you out to see them up close. At sunset, the fishermen prepare for a night’s work aided by batteries of lights on the boats to attract their catch, while local farmers herd their goats or lead their water buffaloes along the sand. If you’re lucky, you may be around to see the races between beautifully decorated pairs of water buffaloes pulling a sled around a track in the fields. Ask if any are scheduled: They follow the Balinese calendar.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
A rough and narrow road from the middle of Bayan ascends rapidly to Batu Koq, and then continues to nearby Senaru, where it ends. Those wanting to go farther have to walk. The original tiny village has traditional Sasak houses on stilts, surrounded by a wooden fence. Some of the locals have opened homestays along the road, a few with a warung attached. Guides and porters can be hired by the day, and you can buy basic food and rent camping gear, including tents. Take water-purifying tablets, warm clothes, and arrange for a small camping stove.<n>The main objective of most trekkers is the awesome crater with its big C-shaped lake. It’s a hard day’s walk from Senaru before you reach the rim. The crater itself is 600 m (2,000 ft) deep, and the steep, quite slippery scramble down to the lake takes several hours more. Plan at least a three-day expedition (five if you also want to climb to the top of Rinjani). Those with a lot less time and energy could take a half-hour walk to a beautiful waterfall and pools in the valley below Senaru.<n>South and East Lombok<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
East of Narmada, near the main road that runs through Lombok, there is a cluster of craft villages. The baskets and tablemats from Loyok are famous throughout Indonesia. In neighboring Rungkang, they make smooth jet-black pots of all sizes and then weave a fine basket to fit tightly around them, using supple lengths of ultra-thin rattan.<n>On the southern slopes of Gunung Rinjani, Tete Batu is a favorite local retreat, with an old hotel and a couple of homestays. Here you can walk to forest waterfalls, while the black monkeys chatter, squeal, and swing in the trees.<n>Labuhan Lombok is a hot, windswept, dusty, end-of-the-world sort of spot, in spite of its picturesque stilt houses. From here, ferries laden with cars, motorbikes, and passengers sail several times a day eastward to the island of Sumbawa from a terminal 3 km (2 miles) from the village.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Two classic Barcelona cafes that are perfect for getting started or winding down are Café de la Ópera (La Rambla, 74) and Els Quatre Gats (Montsió, 3). An excellent wine bar, with a great list of Spanish wines, is El Senyor de la Vinya, right across from the Santa María del Mar church. In good weather, it and another nearby bar set tables out in the plaza, which is unequaled for ambience. A cavernous bodega that became immediately popular with wine lovers is the new but ancient-looking Va de Vi (Banys Vells, 16), near the Picasso Museum. It features a superb wine list and excellent tapas, cheeses and embutidos (Spanish hams, sausages and other cold cuts). El Xampanet (Montcada, 22) is an immensely popular cava bar always full of chatty locals. Schilling (Ferran, 23) draws a smoky European crowd of late-night smokers. Boadas (c/ dels Taller, 1) is a cocktail bar that looks like a movie set for a shoot of 1940s Havana. Bar London (c/ Nou de la Rambla, 34) is a rough-and-tumble place with occasional live jazz and rock. In a gorgeous medieval palace at c/ Montcada, 20, Espai Barroc is a sumptuous, pricey bar that looks like something out of The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, the Peter Greenaway film.<n>Two of the hottest bar scenes are El Born, near Santa María del Mar, and the Port Olímpic near the Hotel Arts. You can’t walk without tripping into a cocktail.<n>A young, hip crowd flocks to chic “design bars” for drinks and dancing. Nick Havana (c/ Rosselló, 208) was one of the pioneers of the design bar genre. Torres de Ávila, within the Poble Espanyol on Montjuïc, is even more extreme, an adventurous fantasy playground designed by Javier Mariscal, one of the hottest designers of late.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt
El Molino (Vila i Vila, 99) is one of Barcelona’s oldest cabarets. Cabaret of the distinctly kitschy kind is the nightly rule at Bodega Bohemia (Lancaster, 2), on the west side of La Rambla. Live jazz most nights of the week can be found at Harlem Jazz Club in the Gothic Quarter (c/ Comtessa de Sobradiel, 8), probably the city’s best jazz club. For live flamenco or pop flamenco, head to Los Tarantos, or for jazz, to Jamboree, both on the Plaça Reial.<n>Luz de Gas (Muntaner, 246) and Otto Zutz (Lincoln, 15) continue to be the reigning dance clubs, which don’t get going until well after midnight. The latest in modern dance, music, and experimental theater is regularly staged in the evenings at the Mercat de les Flors, the old flower market a short walk from the spectacular sound-and-light show of the Font Màgica (see page 68).<n>If you’re lucky enough to be in the city during a festival—either a religious or secular holiday—you’ll see the city’s different neighborhoods erupt into a carnival. Food, fireworks, music, costumes, and especially the huge papier-mâché effigies called gégants (giants) and their comical companions, the cabezudos (bigheads), are essential fiesta features. Each neighborhood has its own identifying models. The gégants are about 4 meters (13 feet) high and elaborately dressed as kings and queens, knights, ladies, gentlemen, and country folk. Cabezudos, meanwhile, are usually oversize cartoon heads of well-known personalities or types. They prance about mischievously, accosting people in the crowd.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt
To call La Rambla a mere street is to do it woeful injustice. Barcelona’s most famous boulevard — energetic, artistic, democratic, and indulgent — is an intoxicating parade of humanity. You’ll no doubt want to sample it several times during your stay (maybe even several times a day) in Barcelona. It is most crowded just before the lunch hour and in the early evening on weekdays and at dusk on weekends, though it is never deserted. In the wee, wee hours it’s populated by a sometimes motley mix of early-morning newspaper sellers, streetsweepers, and bar hounds stumbling back to their apartments and hotels.<n>The broad, tree-shaded, and pedestrian-only promenade stretches nearly 2 km (1 mile) down a gentle incline from the city’s hub, Plaça de Catalunya (see page 54), to the waterfront. La Rambla takes its name from an Arabic word meaning a sandy, dry river bed. It was a shallow gully until the 14th century, when Barcelona families began to construct homes nearby. As the area became more populated, the stream was soon paved over. To the north of Las Ramblas (left as you walk down it) is the old city, Ciutat Vella; to the south, or right, is El Raval.<n>The five sections of La Rambla change in character, as they do in name, as you stroll along. The short Rambla de Canaletes at the top is where crowds pour in from the Plaça de Catalunya or emerge from the metro and train stations beneath. On Sundays and Mondays in season you’ll find rambunctious knots of fans replaying the games of Barça, the popular name for Barcelona’s beloved football (soccer) club Barcelona F.C.; if an important match has just been won, look out. Elderly denizens relax on metal chairs (for which you are supposed to pay) and watch the passing parade. Here, too, begin the stalls where you can buy a diverse stock of foreign newspapers and magazines, as well as books, a reflection of Barcelona’s status as Spain’s center of publishing. You’ll also see the first of La Rambla’s celebrated mimes, or “human statues,” portraying Christopher Columbus, priests, bearded nuns, and Roman soldiers, among many other guises.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
The leafy cloister is a lively refuge, with birds fluttering among the orange, magnolia, and palm trees that entirely fill its center. Watch where you walk, as the cloister is paved with tombstones, badly worn, but many still bearing the emblems of the bootmakers, tailors, and other craft guilds whose wealth helped pay for the cathedral. From the cloister, pass to the Capella de Santa Llúcia, a chapel with 13th- and 14th-century tombstones on the floor and a monument to a crusader knight in armor on one wall.<n>Leaving the chapel by its front entrance, turn left at carrer del Bisbe Irurita. The corner house at Number 8 was until recently the official residence of the president of the Generalitat. Train your eyes upwards as you walk through the old town to take in the details, e.g., a curious hanging sign, a lantern, or an unusual sculpture. On the right you’ll find a row of gargoyles leaning from the roof of the Palau de la Generalitat, the seat of government for the Autonomous Region of Catalonia, and a richly ornamented gateway. The lacy overhead bridge is Gothic only in style; it’s actually a 1929 addition.<n>Just ahead is the spacious, serious Plaça de Sant Jaume, the heart of the Barri Gòtic. A local joke says that the farthest distance in Barcelona is across this square, which separates the often antagonistic and conservative Generalitat from the more progressive municipal authorities in the Ajuntament (City Hall). Architecturally, though, the two buildings make a harmonious pair: both have classical façades that hide their Gothic origins. To visit either building, you’ll need luck and planning; the Generalitat can only be visited on 23 April (Day of St. George), and the Ajuntament only with an organized group and by appointment (see page 113).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
Nearby is the Baixada de Santa Eulàlia. Just off the street is Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, a tiny and silent square closed to traffic (silent except when the nearby school holds recess here). The saint’s church was pockmarked by Italian bombs during the Civil War, though others maintain that firing squads performed executions here.<n>The Baixada de Santa Eulàlia descends to carrer dels Banys Nous, named for the long-gone “new” baths of the ghetto erected in the 12th century. This winding street, which more or less follows the line of the old Roman wall, is the unofficial boundary of the Barri Gòtic. It is also known as the carrer dels antiquaris — the headquarters of antiques dealers. As you walk along, keep your eyes peeled for unusual hand-painted shop signs, the fretwork of Gothic windows, and dusty treasures in the antiques shop windows. You’ll see the old tile signs with a cart symbol high in the walls at some corners, the indication of one-way streets.<n>Around the corner is a trio of impossibly pretty plazas. Plaça de Sant Josep Oriol adjoins Plaça del Pi, on which sits Santa María del Pi, a handsome church with a tall octagonal bell tower and a harmonious façade pierced by a large 15th-century rose window. “Pi” means pine tree, and there is a small specimen here replacing one that was a landmark in past centuries. Buildings in the Plaça del Pi show off the sgrafitto technique of scraping designs in colored plaster, imported from Italy in the early 1700s. (Barcelona’s emerging merchant class favored such façades as an inexpensive substitute for the sculpture that was found in aristocratic palaces.)<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
On the west side is a modern sculptural interpretation, much criticized, that has galvanized those who believed the temple should have been left as it was, unfinished, as a tribute to the great Gaudí. Nevertheless, onward it goes  — when it will be finished, nobody knows. For now and perhaps the generation to come, the great spires are marred by ever-present scaffolding and cranes.<n>A short walk diagonally from La Sagrada Familia is the astonishing Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, designed by Domènech i Montaner (architect of the Palau de la Música Catalana) and completed by his son. The complex of buildings — still a working hospital — is one of modernisme’s most underrated (and least known) achievements.<n>Farther north, in a working class neighborhood on the rising slope of the hills behind Gràcia, Parc Guëll, another wildly ambitious Gaudí project, is a residential community completely intertwined with nature. Although this project too was never completed according to plan, it is a marvelous place to visit: part park, part Hansel-and-Gretel fantasyland. Gaudí’s patron Eusebi Güell bought 6 hectares (15 acres) here, overlooking the city and the sea, intending to create a community of villas. He gave Gaudí carte blanche to produce something original, and for the next 14 years, on and off, the architect delighted in letting his imagination run wild. A gingerbread gatehouse guards the entrance on the carrer d’Olot; a tiled lizard fountain gurgles water from its jaw; supporting columns mimic tree trunks. Ceilings are decorated with broken plates, and wildly undulating benches are splashed with dizzying broken ceramics, Gaudí’s beloved trencadis.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
Waterfront & Barceloneta<n>Barcelona turned its back on the sea in the 19th century and focused on developing industry. The sea wall where families loved to walk and catch the breeze on stifling summer nights was dismantled. Access to and even a view of the sea was obstructed by warehouses and railway tracks. Expansion proceeded towards the hills, and La Barceloneta, a neighborhood created in the mid-1700s between the port and the beach, became the district of modest fishermen and sailors. Now all this has changed again, and a recreational (and increasingly commercial) area has been newly created along the waterfront.<n>Begin a tour of the waterfront at the Columbus Monument, at the foot of the Ramblas. To the right is Les Reials Drassanes, begun in 1255, the only medieval shipyard still in existence and now the Museu Marítim (Maritime Museum). The 16 bays of these yards, which could once handle more than 30 galleys at a time, launched ships that extended Catalonia’s dominion over the Mediterranean from Tunis to Greece, Sicily, Sardinia, and much of the French coast. The museum contains models of ships, from the earliest galleys to the cargo and passenger vessels, that have made Barcelona their home port up to the present day. The prize exhibit is the full-size copy of the Royal Galley, La Reial, aboard which Don Juan of Austria commanded the fleet that defeated the Turks at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
What served as the athletes’ Olympic Village (Vila Olímpica) was planned as an entirely new, planned community (it won Harvard University and Prince Charles design awards). Initially a ghost town of designer apartments, it has blossomed into a vibrant seaside neighborhood for young families and professionals. Tourist interest focuses on the Port Olímpic, the new port, a lively area of restaurants and bars clustered around anchored boats and yachts, the stretch of landscaped beaches called Platjas de Barcelona, and the shopping centered around the deluxe high-rise Hotel Arts, which sits imposingly on the beach.<n>You can either take a bus or the metro to La Barceloneta from Plaça de Catalunya. A sensational ride back is aboard an aerial cable car ride that traverses the length of the port, providing excellent views of the waterfront and La Rambla. The ride climbs to the cable-car tower Torre de Jaume I, 107 meters (351 feet) above the harbor. From there you can descend and walk back to the Columbus monument area, or continue the aerial lift to Montjuïc at the level of the amusement park.<n>Lodged between Port Olímpic and the La Ribera district is Parc de la Ciutadella, the city’s largest park. The expanse contains the city zoo (Parc Zoológic and its rare albino gorilla named Snowflake, or Copito de Nieve), the Museu d’Art Modern (Modern Art Museum), the seat of the Parlament de Catalunya, and the foundations of Ciutadella (Citadel). It’s a lovely park, with a lake, large old trees, and pleasant pathways. The large Baroque fountain, La Cascada, was designed by Josep Fontseré, who had as his assistant a young architecture student named Antoni Gaudí.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
Farther up Montjuïc, turn left where the Avinguda de l’Estadi (the Olympic Ring boulevard) becomes the Avinguda de Miramar, to see the simple and elegant Fundació Joan Miró. The museum was designed in 1975 by the architect Josep Lluís Sert to house a large collection of paintings, drawings, tapestries, and sculpture by the Catalan surrealist. Miró died in 1983 at the age of 90. The exhibits follow Miró’s artistic development from 1914 onwards. Photographs show him always neatly dressed and barbered, looking like a Catalan businessman in contrast to the more bohemian Picasso, and in contrast, too, with the surrealist works he created. The collection is witty and bright with the bright colors and unique language symbols associated with the artist.<n>The Avinguda de Miramar continues past the station of the funicular railway that climbs the hill from the Avinguda del Paral.lel near the Paral.lel metro stop. The funicular links up here with a cable car that goes to the Parc d’Atraccions de Montjuïc, an amusement park, and on to the Castell de Montjuïc on the summit. Cable cars run daily in summer, weekends-only in winter. A short walk from the amusement park is the Plaça de l’Armada station for the cable car that crosses the harbor, completing an interesting network of transport by cable.<n>The fortress atop Montjuïc, built in 1640, remained in use by the army and then as a prison until shortly before it was turned over to the city to become a museum in 1960. The Museu Militar (Military Museum) has an extensive collection of antique weaponry and armor, lead soldiers of different epochs, and models of Catalan castles. Here in a basement room you’ll find what may be the only statue of Generalíssimo Francisco Franco to be seen in Barcelona today. The fort has somber associations for the city: Its cannons bombarded the population to put down rebellions in the 18th and 19th centuries, and it was the site of political executions, including that of Lluís Companys, president of the Generalitat of Catalonia during the Civil War, who was shot by a firing squad in 1940.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
South Beijing<n>Few tourists venture into the Xuanwu and Chongwen districts south of Chang’an Avenue and Tiananmen Square except to visit the Temple of Heaven and perhaps to walk along the charming Liulichang Culture Street. But there are other sights of interest.<n>The Foreign Legation, where foreign governments maintained their own autonomous quarter in Beijing from 1860 to 1937, lies east of Tiananmen Square. No longer the location of the diplomatic compounds in the capital, this district still contains many former embassies, clubs, barracks, churches, and commercial buildings, most now converted to Chinese institutes, banks, and offices. The architecture is fascinating. Located along Taijichang Dajie (the former Customs Street), directly south of Dongchang’an Jie (Chang’an Avenue East), are the old Austrian Legation (now the Institute of International Studies), the Italian Legation (now the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries), the private Peking Club (now the Beijing People’s Congress), and the French Legation and French Barracks (now the offices of the Chinese Workers Union).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt
The Great Wall is best appreciated at four main sites north of Beijing: Badaling, Mutianyu, Simatai, and Juyongguan. Three of these four segments have been carefully refurbished, with the exception of Simatai, which is largely untouched since the days of the early Ming Dynasty. The earthen foundations of the wall and watchtowers, as well as much of the brick-work, are original, most of it 300 to 500 years old, although extensive remodeling and fresh materials have been added.<n>The look and the feel are authentic enough, once one is on the wall itself, out of sight of the shops, vendors, tour buses, parking lots, and cable cars below. The hordes of tourists are another modern addition, of course, but it is possible at all these sites to walk beyond the crowds. The steep mountain scenery is spectacular and the air is usually quite clear. The sheer steepness of the wall’s stone stairs and the precarious footing provided by the irregular treads are what most surprise first-time visitors. As it snakes up and down the peaks and ridges, the wall conforms to a challenging topography, one that leaves many tourists gasping for breath. But the views from China’s ancient Dragon of Stone make the journey unforgettable.<n>Carefully restored in 1957, the Great Wall at Badaling, 67 km (42 miles) northwest of Beijing, is the most-visited portion of the wall. The mountain setting is spectacular and the wall rises and falls steeply as it winds up and down the ridges. About 7 m (24 ft) high and 5 m (18 ft) wide, this Ming Dynasty fortification is built of tamped earth, stone, and brick. Beacon towers of stone and brick are mounted at regular intervals. It is possible to walk the stairs of the restored section for about 2 km (11⁄2 miles) before reaching the crumbling remains of the original wall on either end. At the northern terminus, there is a cable car connecting the wall to a parking lot below. The parking lots at the base of the wall are filled with vendors, stores, restaurants, and other modern attractions, including a cinema and a KFC fast-food outlet.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt

Equally attractive is the second-most visited section of the Great Wall at Mutianyu, 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Beijing. Mutianyu was opened to tourists in 1986 to relieve the crowding at Badaling. There is also a cable car at Mutianyu, eliminating the 20-minute hike up to the wall, and at the foot of the wall there is again a village of vendors, shops, and cafés. Mutianyu is one of the oldest restored sections of the Great Wall in the Beijing area, thought to have been built under the Ming rulers nearly 500 years ago. Visitors can walk well over a kilometer (nearly a mile) atop these ramparts from watchtower to watchtower. At either end you can view the crumbling wall running to the horizon, broken but still visible. In the early spring and late fall, particularly on weekdays, the Great Wall at Mutianya is not very crowded. Surrounded by its renowned green forests, it is a pleasant alternative to Badaling.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt

Surrounded by its renowned green forests, it is a pleasant alternative to Badaling.<n>The Great Wall at Juyongguan, 58 km (36 miles) northwest of Beijing on the way to the Badaling section, is the newest portion of the wall open to tourism (1998) and the nearest to the capital. Juyongguan contains a massive guard tower marking one of the Great Wall’s most celebrated mountain passes. This guard tower, built in 1345, is decorated in Buddhist carvings, with inscriptions in Chinese, Tibetan, Sanskrit, and languages of the northern tribes. Some of the temples and parks clustered at the pass in the days of the Ming dynasty have also been restored here. The wall can be walked for 4 km (21⁄2 miles) as it winds over the peaks of the Taihang Mountains.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt

Some of the temples and parks clustered at the pass in the days of the Ming dynasty have also been restored here. The wall can be walked for 4 km (21⁄2 miles) as it winds over the peaks of the Taihang Mountains.<n>The least restored, least crowded major segment of the Great Wall near Beijing is at Simatai, 124 km (77 miles) northeast of the capital. Not only is Simatai rather far from the capital, it is also quite uncrowded and unreconstructed. Its stairways and watchtowers resemble those crumbling edifices one can only glimpse from Badaling, Mutianyu, and Juyongguan. The natural scenery is dramatic, and the ruined state of the wall gives Simatai a romantic feel (although there is a cable car to the top). It is also dangerous, with broken stairways leading up some of the 70-degree inclines. Other portions are in such ruins that one must walk along the outside of the wall on steep, narrow paths, where the footing is difficult.<n>From the village at the base of Simatai there is a half-mile gravel path to the first stairway, which skirts the small Simatai Reservoir. The reservoir divides the Simatai wall from another section, known as Jinshanling, which adventurous hikers can also tackle. Simatai consists of 14 beacon towers, each about 400 m (a quarter mile) apart, which were once used to transmit fire and smoke signals — tower by tower — to the Chinese armies encamped below should an enemy be sighted. The highest of the beacon towers (known as Wangjinglou) stands at an elevation of 986 m (3,235 ft), affording a grand view southwest toward Beijing. Locals say the lights of the capital are visible on clear evenings from here.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt
The Reichstag<n>A few minutes’ walk from the Kongreßhalle you’ll find the Reichstag building, its huge, new glass dome, with its mirrored central funnel, visible from much of the city. The parliamentary home of Wilhelminian and Weimar Germany displays the proud dedication Dem deutschen Volke (To the German People) on a Neo-Classical façade built in 1894 by Paul Wallot. This appeal to patriotism and democracy, set above six Corinthian columns, outlasted the burning in 1933 and the bombs of World War II, and was given renewed significance when Berlin resumed its former role as the seat of government of a unified Germany. Today, the dome is a major attraction for Berliners and tourists alike. They endure lengthy lines to be able to travel to the top, gazing out at the city and down into the Bundestag chamber. By the end of 2003, the area in front of the Reichstag — currently a vast construction site — will be transformed, with the completion of all the new government district buildings, including the Federal Chancellery. An enormous new Berlin Central Train Station is being erected at Lehrter Bahnhof, and new S– and U–bahn lines are being built, to further extend the city’s already splendid public transport system.<n>South of the Siegessäule stands the elegant, modern shared complex which houses the embassies of Denmark, Finland, Holland, Norway, and Sweden, the architecture a stunning showcase for Scandinavian design and materials.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
On the western edge of Berlin, the dense pine forest which was largely stripped for fuel in 1945, has been replanted, adding to the 18 million pines around 6 million chestnut, linden, beech, birch, and oak trees. The lush wooded areas form a reserve for deer, wild boar, marten, foxes, and rabbits, but there are also plenty of green meadows for picnics, and the forest paths are extremely popular with both cyclists and joggers.<n>The easiest and most direct way to get to the Grunewald is to take the S-Bahn from Bahnhof Zoo to Grunewald S-Bahn station. Alternatively, you could combine your trip with a visit to the museums at Dahlem — the Brücke Museum is only a 20-minute walk from the eastern edge of the forest. Drivers take the Avus and turn off on the Hüttenweg to Grunewaldsee, a lake offering swimming and sandy beaches. On the east shore, in an attractive lakeside setting of beech trees, you will find the Jagdschloß Grunewald, a hunting lodge built in 1542 for Prince Elector Joachim II. Situated in a cobbled courtyard, the lodge has been restored to its original Renaissance appearance.<n>Inside is displayed a rather curious collection of early German hunting portraits and landscapes, among which can be found some remarkable paintings, in particular a series of panels depicting the Passion Cycle by Lucas Cranach. Other German and Dutch works of note are those by Jordaens, Rubens, and Bruyn.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
Inside is displayed a rather curious collection of early German hunting portraits and landscapes, among which can be found some remarkable paintings, in particular a series of panels depicting the Passion Cycle by Lucas Cranach. Other German and Dutch works of note are those by Jordaens, Rubens, and Bruyn.<n>There are marvelous views over the lake from the first- and second-floor rooms, and the period porcelain, furniture, and wooden floors add rustic charm. The nominal admission charge includes entry to the small hunting museum (Jagdmuseum) on the opposite side of the courtyard. A short walk down the path outside the lodge brings you to the rather grand Forsthaus Paulsborn, where you can dine in splendor overlooking the lake.<n>On the Grunewald’s west side, along Havelchaussee, the Grunewaldturm (Grunewald Tower) is a Neo-Gothic tower built in 1897 to commemorate the 100th birthday of King Wilhelm I. You can climb the 205 steps to reach the 55-m- (180-ft- ) high observation platform for views as far as Potsdam. Ferry stations in the area offer boat rides on the River Havel and forest lakes, and the east bank of the Havel is lined with sandy beaches as far as the Wannsee lakes.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
Brücke Museum<n>The Bridge Museum is an intimate, single-story museum situated in a pleasant suburb about 20 minutes’ walk from Jagdschloß Grunewald. Take U1 to Oskar-Helene-Heim, then bus 115 to Pücklerstraße. The museum is 5 minutes from the bus stop.<n>The museum was created in 1967 to house works of classical modernism, thanks to a legacy of Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, a member of the Expressionist group Die Brücke which worked in Dresden from 1905 to 1913. A large number of the group’s works were labeled as “degenerate” and thus destroyed by the Nazis. Schmidt-Rottluff’s own bold paintings hang beside the works of fellow Expressionists Emil Nolde, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, and Max Pechstein.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
From the bank, head for Queen Street, which leads north from the Birdcage, a metal cage once used by police officers to direct the traffic that regularly comes to a halt on Front Street. It was designed by a Mr. Bird, although it also has a resemblance to “Tweetie Bird’s” cage. Traffic lights now regulate the junction. Remember to look right as you prepare to cross the road!<n>On the left as you walk up Queen Street is Perot Post Office, named after the man who was appointed Bermuda’s first Postmaster General in 1821. He had actually been acting as “unofficial” postman for several years, meeting the ships and putting the letters under his hat before touring the town to deliver them. William B. Perot (pronounced “Pea-rut”) went one stage further in 1848 when he began to produce his own postage stamps; only 11 are known to exist today, making each one extremely valuable. The little Post Office is very much as Perot kept it, neat and simply furnished. The building still houses an active post office, which makes it an appropriate place to buy the stamps for your postcards. Bermudian stamps always have a colorful and interesting design; perhaps you can start a collection by buying a set for yourself.<n>Just behind the Post Office is a building that houses the Bermuda National Library and the Historical Society Museum, prime collections devoted to important historical documents and artifacts from the island. The public rooms are small but full of Bermudian treasures. Silver, china, coins, and furniture have been gathered together, including rare and valuable “hog” money as well as some of the Confederate notes that were used to pay for goods before the Civil War. Many Bermudian businessmen and sailors were paid in money that became worthless after the Unionists won the war.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
Across Victoria Street from the bus terminal is Victoria Park, originally a children’s playground but later landscaped to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. The main features are the sunken garden, lawns, and flowerbeds in traditional English style, and the beautiful ornate iron bandstand, where open-air concerts are still performed during the summer and in December just before Christmas.<n>Return to Church Street and walk east to the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, consecrated in 1905 after a fire destroyed the previous edifice in 1884. The style is Early English, with a tower rising 44 m (143 ft) to provide good views of the town. You can climb to the top for a small donation to church funds; the tower is open on weekdays only. Perhaps the most dramatic area in the church is the wall behind the altar, where there are sculptures in niches depicting Christ and the saints. Completed in 1967 it is a fitting modern edition to the church. By contrast, farther along Church Street is the oldest church in Hamilton, St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church (founded in 1843), as well as Wesley Methodist Church.<n>Across Church Street from Wesley Methodist Church you will find the rear portion of Sessions House, home to the Bermuda Assembly and the Supreme Court. Walk down Parliament Street to reach the front of the building. Sessions House dates from 1819, but the Italianate tower, colonnades, and decorative touches were added in 1887 for the Silver Jubilee. Bermuda’s parliament is the second oldest in the British Commonwealth and is still modeled after its predecessor in London. The annual opening ceremonies and the regular sessions are open to visitors, who can sit in the public gallery to watch the robed and white-wigged Speaker preside over the legislative deliberations (the Assembly meets on Fridays from late October until early July). The Supreme Court can also be viewed and is in session throughout the year.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
Outside the Cabinet building on Front Street is the Cenotaph, which commemorates Bermuda’s dead of the two World Wars. The monument dates from 1920, its design based on that of the war memorial that stands in London’s Whitehall. The solemn ceremonies of Remembrance Day take place here on 11 November each year, when wreaths are laid and silent homage is paid to those who gave their lives.<n>From Front Street, a ten-minute walk up the steep incline of King Street leads to Fort Hamilton, which was built in 1889 to protect the harbor and formed part of a line of defense for the naval dockyard to the west. Today it offers spectacular views over the rooftops of Hamilton, especially thrilling when the cruise ships are in port. The upper levels and battlements have been landscaped with fine lawns, which make a fine place for a summer picnic. Long, cool tunnels in the depths of the defenses were originally dug as a protected route for ammunition replenishment. They also lead to the deep moat, once the first line of protection against manned assault but now converted into a splendid tropical garden with varieties of giant bamboo, fern, and ficus. Creeping plants now climb the sheer walls, providing a new home to numerous birds, lizards, and frogs. Every Monday from November to March, the fort hosts a display by the Bermuda Islands Pipe Band, complete with kilts and highland dancers.<n>East on Front Street, out of Hamilton yet only a few minutes walk from the shops and restaurants of the town center, is the Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute, which celebrates the important part Bermuda has played in the development of this fledgling science and sport. The building has a light and spacious modern design, offering the chance to wander easily among the exhibits. A short video tells the story of the development of the Bathysphere, a machine that could withstand the immense water pressure thousands of feet beneath the surface so that scientists could study the creatures living at those depths. Displays explain how a seashell is created, and, in the next room, the Stonington Collection comprises 5000 different seashell varieties from around the world, including many found in waters off Bermuda. The sheer variety and beauty are breathtaking.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt

The sheer variety and beauty are breathtaking.<n>The finale of your visit to the Institute is a simulated trip aboard a deep-sea exploration vessel that transports you 3,660 m (about 12,000 ft) under sea, the approximate depth of the Atlantic in the waters surrounding Bermuda’s shallow coral reefs. The introduction to the “dive” paints a vivid picture of the geology of Bermuda and its incredible position in the middle of this vast, deep ocean. Your journey leads through re-creations of the environments found at several different ocean layers, then on to displays of treasure salvaged from wrecks around the island. The whole exhibit makes you appreciate the work of the ferry pilots who guide ships in and out of the treacherous reefs surrounding Bermuda.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
You will come first to the Elbow Beach Resort and the nearby public Bermuda Beach. The resort is one of the premier hotels on the island and sits on a long stretch of sand that is for hotel guests exclusively. South Road travels on top of the cliffs and offers beautiful views of the sand dunes and beaches below. Don’t worry about trying to take in these views while driving, for there are many stopping places along the way where you can take photographs or simply enjoy the panorama. The way to each beach is marked with a wooden sign, which leads to parking areas for bicycles and cars off the main road.<n>Once you reach Warwick Long Bay there are a series of public beaches that allow you to walk along the sand or find a patch to call your own for the day. Miles of footpaths in the dunes and undulating grassland behind the beaches have been designated as South Shore Park. These areas are perfect for walking, jogging, or horseback riding (see box opposite).<n>The most southerly of the beaches fronting South Shore Park is Horseshoe Bay, one of the prettiest and most photographed on Bermuda. A crescent of fine pink-tinged sand with good facilities including a restaurant/café, it makes a good starting or finishing point for your explorations.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
West End: Somerset and Ireland Islands<n>The bridge that connects Somerset Island and its parish of Sandys (pronounced “Sands”) to the main island is quite short. If you travelled on immediately it would be easy to miss one of the curiosities of Bermuda, for Somerset Bridge is said to be the narrowest drawbridge in the world. The section which opens is wide enough to allow the passage of only a boat’s mast! It is operated by simply lifting two planks of wood by hand; one has to marvel at the skill of the sailors who use the bridge regularly. The bridge and surrounding supports were renovated in 1998. The ferry service from Hamilton also stops here on its way to Dockyard. Take the ferry or walk along the old Bermuda Railway Trail, which is extremely scenic along this section. There are several deep “cuts” created for the rail line, with tiny wooden foot bridges over the top.<n>The road into Somerset Island leads around a pretty bay and onto Fort Scaur, which stands on a rocky hillock hidden from the road. The fort was begun in 1869 to protect the land route to the naval dockyard at the end of the island. The layout is the so-called Prussian design, a polygon shape developed by German engineers at the time. The gunning placements held “disappearing” guns, which could not be seen from land or sea. Other gunning placements were also added by US engineers during World War II. A sturdy caponier (a small fortified room with openings for rifles) was to act as a last defense if the battlements were overrun. It was never needed, as the fort never saw any action, and today the ramparts offer panoramic views of Great Sound. There are 9 hectares (22 acres) of grassland all around the fort where you can enjoy a picnic.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
Walk through the Cooperage to reach the Victualing Yard, where you will find the Tourist Information Bureau, then across the park and around the dry dock area, which is still used to repair the boats and buoys so vital to ship safety. On the left is the Bermuda Pottery, where you’ll find experts crafting and firing ceramics with a series of island motifs.<n>Your walk will then lead to the Clocktower Building, perhaps the most elegant of the structures at dockyard. Its long lines and minimalist façade once housed administrative offices, but the interior has been transformed into a smart shopping mall with luxury goods from jewelry to cigars. Above the ground floor shops is a light, open space designed for conventions and exhibitions.<n>There are several restaurants in the dockyard as well as places to sit in the sunshine and have a picnic. In summer, cruise ships dock at the small port outside the main harbor wall, providing a good picture of how the working dockyard must have looked when it was home to British naval vessels.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
Bailey’s Bay is the northern section of Hamilton Parish, which you’ll find just before reaching the Causeway that crosses Castle Harbour to the airport and St. George’s. Bailey’s Bay has a number of attractions within walking distance of each other. If traveling by bus, get off at the Swizzle Inn, famed across the island for its “Rum Swizzle” drinks (made from a secret recipe); it’s also a great place for lunch.<n>Only a short walk west from the Inn, you will find the Bermuda Perfumery and Gardens. This small family business was established in 1929 by Madeleine and Herbert Scott in a garden shed. They moved to their present site in 1939 and proceeded to plant the acres of flowers that serve as raw materials to produce their small range of signature fragrances. The business has now been passed on to their son. You can take a free tour of the “factory,” housed in a 200-year-old farmhouse, where you can watch the process of perfume production, including the techniques for collecting the ripe blooms. Then take your time and wander among the fragrant gardens with their swathes of jasmine, frangipani, and passion flower,their scents heavy in the warm air. You can also browse in the gift shop, which sells perfumes produced here as well as other souvenirs.<n>After leaving the perfumery, head back toward the Swizzle Inn and turn right at Wilkinson Avenue (by Bailey’s Ice Cream Parlour). From here it is only a five-minute walk to Crystal Caves. The unique geological conditions that formed Bermuda created a number of cave systems. Experts claim that there are many yet to be explored and charted, and perhaps the Crystal Cave system might itself have been left undiscovered were it not for a quirk of fate. In 1907, two young boys were playing cricket, and after a particularly good stroke they lost the ball down a small sinkhole. They decided to try to retrieve the ball and, with ropes and lanterns, they entered the hole and discovered a magical landscape 37 m (120 ft) underground. They never did find their cricket ball, but when you enter the caves you will understand why they became distracted from their original purpose. The caves have cathedral-like dimensions, with hundreds of stalactites and stalagmites hundreds of thousands of years old. The stalactites grow at a rate of 1 cm (about a half inch) every 100 years, so it is easy to begin to estimate the age of the largest structures. A clear tidal lake sits at the bottom of the cave, spanned by a pontoon bridge so you can explore the interior. Strategic lighting shows the formations to their best effect — and nature at its most awe-inspiring.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt

From April to October you’ll see how heat from the furnace and the skill of the glass blower combine to create beautiful and colorful objects. You can also buy one of these unusual souvenirs in the attached gallery.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
St. George’s Island<n>Back at the airport, cross the bridge and turn left to get to Ferry Point, an important strategic area of land at the western tip of St. George’s Island. There are no less than three separate fortifications here protecting the entrance to St. George’s Harbour. The earliest was Burnt Point Fort, built in 1688 to help stop illegal trading by local sailors. The Ferry Island Fort, on a small island a short distance offshore, was begun in the 1790s and was almost constantly developed for the next 80 years. In 1823, Major Thomas Blanchard constructed Martello Tower on high ground behind the two forts, where soldiers could survey the surrounding land and coastline. Today the remains of all three fortifications comprise Ferry Point Park, where it is possible to explore the forts at your leisure, walk through woodland, and enjoy the beauties of Lover’s Lake. It is a wonderful place to have a picnic, and it’s relatively quiet, even on a summer weekend.<n>Returning to Ferry Point junction, take the north fork to St. George’s town. You’ll travel around the far side of Mullet Bay — a sheltered natural harbor for small craft — and then past a children’s play area before reaching the outskirts of town. (St. George’s can be reached via bus routes #1, #3, #10, and #11.)<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
Nearby, the 220-ft- (67- m-) tall tapering granite obelisk, the Bunker Hill Monument commemorates the first battle of the Revolution, on 17 June, 1775 — a hollow victory for the British who suffered more than 1,000 casualties against 400 to 600 for the colonials. Despite the name it actually stands on Breed’s Hill, the site of the colonial redoubt in the battle. At its base is a swashbuckling statue by William Wetmore Storey of American Colonel Prescott, who gave the famous order: “Don’t fire ’til you see the whites of their eyes.” There are informative models depicting the battle’s progress as well as hourly musket-firing demonstrations. You can climb the 294 spiral steps to an enclosed deck, which has great views. A multimedia presentation at The Bunker Hill Pavilion re-enacts the battle.<n>To reach Charlestown: walk along the Freedom Trail (roughly a 15-minute walk from Copp’s Hill to the Naval Yard) or take the Orange Line to Community College (10 minutes to Bunker Hill Monument), or else take the water shuttle from Long Wharf.<n>The Financial District and Chinatown<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
Wharves reach out into Boston Harbor from Downtown and the North End like the fingers on a hand. Once this was the second busiest port in the United States, with clippers jostling for space. Today after a long period of decline, the area has revived and the granite warehouses have been renovated into apartments, restaurants, offices, and hotels. The British sailed home from Long Wharf. Today you can sail to the Harbor Islands, take a cruise around the harbor, or just sit and admire the craft at anchor.<n>On Central Wharf, the New England Aquarium is one of the best anywhere. Its centerpiece is a giant 200,000-gallon tank containing a 24-ft- (7-m-) deep coral reef filled with sharks, sea turtles, and 600 fish from 100 species. Five times a day, scuba divers go in to feed the fish, a fascinating spectacle to watch. Ramps circle the tank so that you can walk around the whole thing. More than 70 exhibit tanks make up the Aquarium galleries. They are categorized as salt or fresh water and feature communities of fish inhabiting different marine climates, from cold and temperate to tropical. Visitors can see the life forms found in a salt marsh, a mangrove swamp, or along the New England seashore. Kids love the Touch Tide Pool where they can handle crabs and starfish. Other perennial favorites are the penguins, the sea otters, and the sea lions, who provide entertainment in the theater. The aquarium is currently undergoing an expansion that will triple its size. The new West Wing containing a large outdoor seal exhibit, two floors of exhibits, plus visitor facilities opened in 1998. A large-format theater will open in 2001 and the new East Wing in 2003.<n>To the south Rowes Wharf hosts many different cruise ships and also anchors the luxurious Boston Harbor Hotel.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
There’s an even better view from the top of the 253-ft (77-m) Pilgrim Monument in Provincetown. It’s called the Pilgrim monument because this is where the Pilgrims actually landed first before moving on to Plymouth. The museum at the base of the tower tells the story.<n>P-Town, is a fabled place. Although the main street is crowded and lined with commercial tourist trinket stores, it still has a magical atmosphere, because it has an “anything goes” attitude. It is the East Coast’s gay mecca (along with the Hamptons, and Cherry Grove and the Pines on Fire Island). Same-sex couples walk the streets hand in hand, and outrageous transvestites entertain in the cabarets. Families come to browse the stores selling T-shirts, and scrimshaw and driftwood curios, and to enjoy the beaches and the fishing and whale-watch trips. In the early 20th century Provincetown was a major art colony and there are still numerous art galleries, particularly at the east end of town.<n>In summer, the town is swamped and every guesthouse filled. In winter, it’s quiet. Many of the commercial stores close and only the residents remain — a community of artists, Portuguese fishermen, and a handful of restaurateurs. You can visit Provincetown for a day (see page 110), but if you don’t stay longer, you’ll miss half the fun.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
The area overlooks the city from a long, narrow plateau, divided into two: the southern part, occupied by the enormous Royal Palace where the original castle once stood, and the northern district of historic streets, where 14th- and 15th-century aristocrats and artisans once rubbed shoulders.<n>From Pest there are various ways of getting up to Castle Hill. The most popular method of ascent is aboard the 19th-century sikló (funicular) which starts by the end of the Chain Bridge and rises to the Royal Palace. Alternatively take the metro to Moszkva tér, climb up the steps to the road, and catch the mini Várbusz service which shuttles to and from Dísz tér, stopping at numerous points en route. You could simply walk up the hill using any one of several streets and staircases, but one method you cannot use is your own transport; cars are forbidden on the hill (unless you are a resident or a guest at the Hilton Hotel), thus preserving the area’s historic ambience.<n>Historic Streets<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
Historic Streets<n>Turning right at the funicular terminus, a short walk brings you to Dísz tér (Parade Square) which marks the start of the northern district. The Mátyás templom (Matthias Church) spire, towering gracefully over this historic area, is the best reference point for our tour. The church takes its name from Hungary’s favourite medieval king, who married here twice in the 15th century. The Emperor Franz Joseph I was crowned king of Hungary here in 1867, to the tune of the Coronation Mass, composed by Liszt for the occasion.<n>The original church was built in the mid-13th century, converted into a mosque during the Turkish occupation, and seriously damaged during Buda’s recapture in 1686. It was rebuilt in Baroque style after the return of the Christian forces, and between 1873 and 1896 it was completely reconstructed along its present Neo-Gothic lines.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
At number 9 you can descend deep into the hill via a series of tunnels that were dug in medieval times as an escape route in times of siege. They were used again as air-raid shelters and an emergency hospital in 1944–1945. Here visitors can join a guided tour of the caves and tunnels, which also contain a waxwork exhibition depicting episodes of Hungarian history.<n>Uri utca terminates at Dísz tér, where it’s best to turn and walk back along Tárnok utca. Among the shops and restaurants here are a number of ﬁne buildings. The orange-and-red geometric frescoes painted on the overhanging ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Aranyhordó (Golden Barrel) restaurant are the most noteworthy. Next door, number 18 was built as a merchant’s house in the ﬁrst half of the 15th century. Used as the Arany Sas (Golden Eagle) pharmacy from 1750 until 1913, it is now the most attractive of this area’s small museums. Beautiful old majolica vessels are the stars of an atmospheric re-creation of the pharmacy, and there are also informative displays on potions, practices, and alchemy in the Budapest of this era.<n>The ﬁnal street of this district to be explored is the leafy Tóth Arpád sétány. This promenade, situated along the western ramparts, offers views of the Buda Hills and the huge Southern Railway Station (Déli pályaudavar) rather than a glorious Danube panorama. Nonetheless, this is a delightful stroll, particularly in early evening, when the locals come out to enjoy the fresh air. At the northern end, various cannon signal the entrance to the Museum of Military History (Hadtörténeti Múzeum). It’s an extensive exhibition and popular with school-children, but the section dedicated to the 1956 uprising is the most memorable for older visitors.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
Historically, Obuda is the oldest quarter of Buda, centred on the site of Aquincum, the capital of the Roman province of Lower Pannonia. Nowadays it’s a nightmare of Soviet town-planning, with heavy trafﬁc constantly rumbling past on the main northern highway out of Budapest. Amid this unlikely setting, however, there are some major Roman remains to be discovered.<n>To begin the Roman route, take any number of city buses north to the so-called Military Amphitheatre (Katonai Amﬁteátrum), thus distinguishing it from a smaller one a short distance farther north. Gladiators performed here in the second century to amuse legionnaires. Completely forgotten for centuries, the ruins were only partially restored in the 1930s. Now it’s effectively a grassy piece of parkland where locals play and walk their dogs, but enough remains of the amphitheatre walls and outline to give a good idea of what it was once like.<n>Farther north, beneath the Flórián tér ﬂyover on the Buda side of the Arpád Bridge, stand the ruins of baths built for the Roman legions. Take the walkway on the opposite side of the ﬂyover from the baths and you will catch the incongruous sight of a dozen isolated Corinthian columns with a 1960s housing estate backdrop.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
Buda Hills<n>The Buda Hills area is a greenbelt that lies due west of Rózsadomb, though it stretches as far north as Obuda and as far south as the start of the M7 highway. Choose a clear day, then catch any one of several trams or buses which go past the cog-railway terminus (just west of Moszkva tér, opposite the Hotel Budapest). There is room on the train for mountain bikes if you are feeling particularly active. The train passes smart residential houses on its way to the terminus and park of Sváb-hegy. A short walk across the park (just follow the crowds) is the stop for the Children’s Railway (Széchenyi-hegyi Gyermekvasút), thus named because it is operated almost entirely by school-children; only the engine drivers are adults.<n>This is an old narrow-gauge line which traverses seemingly unspoiled forests — but for the numerous walking trails — and climbs, slowly, ever-upwards. At the ﬁrst stop, Normafa, you’ll find a ski-run, but unless it’s snowing stay on the train until János-hegy. It is a 10–15 minute walk from here to the János-hegy lookout tower, at 529 metres (1,735 feet) the highest point in the city. If the horizon is not blurred by mist, there’s a splendid 360-degree view for mile upon mile; you can also eat here.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt

The views from the chair-lift are also spectacular, and the peace and quiet as you soar up and down the mountainside is quite extraordinary. Remember to note that the chairlift is closed on some Mondays — check with Tourinform, or go on another day. If you would prefer a speedy return to town, catch the 158 bus (to Moszkva tér) from near the bottom of the chair-lift.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
Just off here is Szervita tér, notable for a splendid patriotic-religious Art Nouveau mosaic fantasy. It occupies the very top of the old Turkish Banking House.<n>Head south along Petoﬁ Sándor utca; on your right is the Párisi Udvar (Paris Arcade), built in 1909. Inside, look up to enjoy the exotic Art Nouveau styling and glasswork; then walk round to see the stylish front of the building, where there is an IBUSZ tourist information ofﬁce.<n>Directly across the busy road (it’s best to use the underpass) are three ﬁne churches and part of the university complex. On the corner of Ferenciek tere stands the Franciscan Church, constructed around 1758. Look at the relief on the side wall, depicting the ﬂood of 1838 that caused massive destruction in the entire inner city. Then continue along Károlyi Mihály utca, past the yellow University Library building on your left. On the opposite corner is the University Church (Egyetemi templom). Built between 1725 and 1742 by the monks of the Order of St. Paul, it features splendidly rich Baroque carving. Turn into Szerb utca, where there are more university buildings. The Serbian Church on this quiet street dates from 1688 and has a beautiful interior.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
Lipótváros<n>Bounded by Jozséf Attila utca to the south and by Bajcsy-Zsilinszky út to the east, Lipótváros (Leopold Town) lies directly north of the inner city. Directions to find the Basilica of St. Stephen (Szent István Bazilika) aren’t needed, as its 96-metre (315-foot) dome dominates the skyline. The biggest church in Budapest, built between 1851 and 1905, it is frequently full to its capacity of 8,500 people. Its exterior is in a poor state, though slowly being restored. Before seeing the interior, ascend the tower. It’s a long walk to the top, but you are rewarded with Pest’s highest viewpoint.<n>The interior of the basilica is dimly lit. There is an interesting main attraction in a reliquary in a rear chapel: the Szent Jobb (“Holy Right”) is the much revered holy relic of the right hand of St. Stephen; you’ll need a 20-forint piece to illuminate it.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt

There is an interesting main attraction in a reliquary in a rear chapel: the Szent Jobb (“Holy Right”) is the much revered holy relic of the right hand of St. Stephen; you’ll need a 20-forint piece to illuminate it.<n>Szabadság tér (Freedom Square), a short walk to the north, is probably Pest’s ﬁnest architectural ensemble. At its centre is an obelisk dedicated to the Soviet troops who fell in the city, but the enormous, ostentatious buildings surrounding the square are what really steal the show. The superb lemon-coloured Art Nouveau building close to the obelisk is home to the American Embassy. Next door is the former Stock Exchange (now the country’s TV headquarters), a showy, eclectic building with some good reliefs. The Hungarian National Bank on the opposite side of the square is the work of the same architect.<n>The great dome of Parliament, equal in height to that of the basilica, is clearly visible from the square. The Houses of Parliament (Országház) were built between 1885 and 1902 as a symbol of the grandeur of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Its vital statistics are impressive: 268 metres (879 feet) long, 691 rooms, and an estimated 20 km (12 miles) of staircase inside. The architect may not have had London’s Houses of Parliament in mind, but whatever his intentions, the Neo-Gothic arches and turrets rarely escape comparison with those of Westminster.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
San Franciscans are quite unashamedly in love with their town. Its natural setting, nestled in the hills around the bay, makes the city uncommonly cozy; the zip in the air is invigorating, and even the fog that rolls in off the ocean seems more romantic than chilling. If you have a car, one way to begin your visit is to travel along 49-Mile Drive, which provides a comprehensive tour of the main sights. You’ll need to use a good map, as the blue signposts with a white seagull in the center can be difficult to locate. Stop off at Twin Peaks (the road to get there starts near the southern end of Market Street) for an excellent panoramic view of the city and the bay, then park the car, put on a pair of comfortable walking shoes, and take to the city’s first-class public transport system (see page 120).<n>Start at the bridge. The city has more than one, but the one is, of course, the Golden Gate Bridge. The name Golden Gate was given to the city’s harbor entrance in 1846 by Captain John Frémont, but the mile-wide channel lay unspanned until the bridge, a masterpiece of engineering by Joseph Strauss, was completed in 1937. At 4,200 ft (1,280 m), it was the world’s longest single span until New York’s Verrazano Narrows Bridge surpassed it in 1964, but few would deny that it remains the most beautiful suspension bridge in the world. It took four years and $35 million to build; more than 40 million vehicles now cross over the span every year. You can take a bus to the bridge entrance and then walk across — it’s just as exciting an urban adventure as climbing up the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building. The bridge trembles underneath your feet, and the lamp-posts rattle as the wind whistles through swooping cables. But don’t worry — the 746-ft- (227-m-) high towers are well embedded in earthquake-proof foundations.<n>Visible in the distance is the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, known locally as just the Bay Bridge. This silver-gray structure swings across to Oakland via two suspension spans, a cantilever span, and a tunnel through Treasure Island. It’s the bridge you’ll take to go to Berkeley (see page 40) and is one of the routes to the wine country of Napa and Sonoma (see page 41).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
At the Broadway Street edge of the Gaslamp Quarter, you can’t miss Horton Plaza, one of the best modern shopping malls in the United States. Along with six floors of shops and restaurants, open-air terraces, and quirky decorations, visitors will find the local half-price ticket booth, Times Arts Tix (Tel. 619/497-5000). Broadway ends at the harbor, where visitors can visit one of several 19th-century ships moored on the Embarcadero and belonging to the excellent Maritime Museum.<n>The city’s pride and joy is the iron-hulled square-rigger Star of India, built in the Isle of Man in 1863. The Star is the oldest sailing ship that is still seaworthy; she makes a celebratory cruise twice each summer. A brief walk along the waterfront leads to Seaport Village, a lively complex of shops, restaurants, and galleries overlooking the harbor.<n>One of the best ways to appreciate San Diego’s sparkling beauty is from the sea. You can take a cruise along the bay — boat trips leave from Harbor Drive, just south of the Maritime Museum — out past the man-made Harbor and Shelter Islands and around the tip of the Coronado peninsula (occupied by a US Naval Air Station — the film Top Gun was set nearby in northern San Diego) to Point Loma out on the Pacific coast. The seemingly endless procession of fishing boats, yachts, and US Navy vessels makes for a fascinating tour.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
The oldest part of San Diego is situated 3 miles (4.8 km) north of downtown in the area known as Old Town (bounded by Juan, Congress, Twiggs, and Wallace streets). Here, in 1769, the European colonization of California commenced, beginning with the construction of Father Junípero Serra’s Mission San Diego de Alcala. In this area of restored adobe buildings, you can enjoy a rest under the palms and eucalyptus of Plaza Vieja (originally the town plaza and bullfight arena before the Yankees arrived), browse among the stalls selling Mexican handicrafts, or eat at one of the many restaurants.<n>Cabrillo National Monument, situated on the Point Loma promontory (I-5/I-8 exit on Rosecrans Street and follow the signs), celebrates the man who discovered San Diego Bay. You can walk the trails around the point, visit the Old Point Loma Lighthouse, and at low tide explore the tide pools for crabs, starfish, anemone, and, if you are lucky, perhaps even the odd, elusive octopus. If you’re here between December and March, watch for migrating gray whales from the look-out point near the lighthouse.<n>Other aquatic pursuits can be enjoyed at Mission Bay, a first-class watersports center and park. The bay is also home of the famous Sea World marine park, where you’ll be able to watch performing two-ton killer whales. Children especially will enjoy the antics of the trained dolphins, sea lions, and otters.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
Another beautiful walk, and by no means an exhausting one, is out to Crescent Meadow, passing on the way such venerable trees as the Bear’s Bathtub, the Shattered Giant, and the Chimney.<n>The real back country is found 11 miles (18 km) along the High Sierra Trail, beyond Crescent Meadow at Bearpaw Meadow. The hike is not too formidable, and the meadow has a rudimentary campsite — though spaces are limited. Within a day’s walk are a lake and streams with good fishing, especially for trout, and you’ll have a fair chance of spotting some of the park’s wildlife, too — bobcats, coyotes, golden eagles, black bear, spotted skunk, and cougar.<n>Death Valley National Park<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
Get up at dawn — you won’t regret it — and drive out to Zabriskie Point. As the sun rises behind you, the light hits Tucki Mountain and the tips of the Panamints to the west before plunging into the valley’s primeval salt lake far below. Continue to Dante’s View (altitude 5,745 ft/1,750 m), where you can look out westward to Wildrose, Bennett, and Telescope peaks. Down in the valley in front of you lies the salty puddle called Badwater — at 282 ft (86 m) below sea level, which is the lowest point in the western hemisphere.<n>The crazed and pinnacled surface of the salt-caked lake bed has earned it the nickname of Devil’s Golf Course. Take a walk out across that glaring expanse of baked salt — the atmosphere of desolation is almost exhilarating. If you look closer at the salt under your feet, you’ll discover that the expansion of the crystallizing mineral has heaved it into bizarre funnels, swirls, and other intricate patterns.<n>On the way back toward Furnace Creek lies Artist’s Drive, where the road (one way only from south to north) carves its path through a canyon of multi-colored rocks, culminating in the very aptly named Artist’s Palette. Here, oxidization has turned the rocks bright mauve, ochre, green, vermilion, turquoise, and purple.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
Ethnically diverse, Toronto is Canada’s largest city, home to 4.3 million people. Hard to believe that this gleaming citadel of big business and the good urban life was a malarial swamp in the 1790s. Muddy York once could be recommended only by its commanding position on Lake Ontario, from which Fort York guarded the troublesome American border. Today, the mud is neatly paved over, the mosquitoes have flown elsewhere, and the Americans are less trouble than they used to be. Yonge Street, the military highway that founder John Simcoe thrust north from the fort to Lake Simcoe, starts out now as downtown Toronto’s main commercial artery. Its intersection at the elegant shopping thoroughfare, Bloor Street, is the fashionable hub of the city.<n>Following John Simcoe’s military grid pattern, Toronto’s main arteries run from the lakefront north: Spadina and University Avenues, Bay, Yonge, and Church Streets; and east–west: Front, King, Queen, Dundas, College-Carlton, and Bloor Streets. Our sightseeing itinerary starts down at the waterfront and works north through the business district to the chic shopping and museum area. As an alternative, especially if you have children, you may prefer to start downtown, around Union Station, and visit the other sights to the north before coming back to relax among the recreational attractions of the waterfront. Getting around the city is quite simple, but while downtown, park your car and walk or use the buses or subway.<n>Waterfront Area<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Between Avenue Road and Yonge Street north of Bloor is Yorkville, the town’s most appealing district in which to stroll. In a transformation no less dramatic than the Harbourfront, the hippy slum of the 1960s has been refurbished into a chic neighborhood of fashionable boutiques, art galleries, sidewalk cafés, gourmet restaurants, and colorfully repainted old houses. Hazelton Lanes is a delightful variation on the conventional shopping mall, where the maze of walkways and staircases around sunken courtyards is deliberately designed to get you lost until you buy or eat your way out.<n>You might very easily walk right past the unprepossessing façade of the Metro Toronto Library (on Yonge one block north of Bloor), but the subtly interconnected areas of architect Raymond Moriyama’s striking interior may tempt you to give up your vacation and get down to some solid study. Five floors of book stacks in a décor of orange and burnt sienna surround a brilliant atrium enclosing greenery, a fountain, and a reflector pool, while a transparent elevator zips silently up and down.<n>Crazy Casa Loma, northwest of Yorkville at 1 Austin Terrace, is Toronto’s answer to California’s Hearst Castle. Its battlements and turrets are all a self-respecting financier like Henry Pellatt could have wished for. After touring the castles of Europe for a few ideas, he built the 98-room mansion in the early 1900s at the then-astronomical cost of $3,500,000. He chose his oak and walnut from North America, teak from Asia, paneling, marble, and glass from Europe. With all its terraces, massive walls, and echoing rooms, it isn’t exactly cozy. That may explain why Pellatt provided himself with a secret escape route through a hidden staircase leading from his study (and now open to the public). Whatever folly of grandeur the financier entertained is best seen in the opulently paneled Oak Room and the stained-glass dome, marble floors, and Italianate bronze doors of the Conservatory. Take the long tunnel from the wine cellar to the stables, where the horses were spoiled silly with a home of Spanish tile and mahogany.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Accommodatingly situated on the border between Ontario and Québec, Ottawa is a fully bilingual city, though most of the French-speaking community (and the best restaurants) now have their homes in Hull on the Québec side of the Ottawa River.<n>Except for longer excursions, try to leave the car in the hotel parking lot and walk or take the bus. The complex system of one-way streets designed to avoid rather than to reach key government buildings, and the added confusion of curving rivers and canals, make downtown driving a harrowing business even for locals. One other point: In the absence of any clear logic in street numbering, it’s important when noting an address to be sure you have the nearest cross-streets as well as the number of the building.<n>Parliament Area<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Where the road crosses over the Rideau River and Green Island, look for Rideau Falls, pouring its double “curtain” (French rideau) of water into the Ottawa River. The windmill is part of a Renewable Energy Exhibit of methods of gathering solar and wind energy.<n>For Canadians, 24 Sussex Drive has the same significance as 10 Downing Street for the British. This grey stone house hidden behind the greenery is the Canadian Prime Minister’s residence. His neighborhood, in Rideau Hall just along the road (1 Sussex Drive), is the official residence of the monarchy, the governor general. Except on official occasions, the guards in appropriately British uniforms will usually let you drive or walk in to admire the sweeping stretch of lawns and gardens — look for the governor’s toboggan slide and skating rink.<n>The drive then circles around the immaculate gardens and fine mansions of Rockcliffe Park. The park’s driveway takes you out to the Rockcliffe Lookout for a spectacular view of the Ottawa River and the mouth of the Gatineau. In the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Barracks, at the north end of St. Laurent Boulevard, you can see some of the horses performing or training for the popular RCMP Musical Ride, the one occasion when the Mounties are still Mounties.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Mount Royal<n>For an overall view of the city, start with a bracing walk up the slopes of the charming Mount Royal Park (Parc du Mont-Royal). Follow the footpath and stairs from the end of Peel Street or a shorter route from the Chemin Remembrance car park. Perhaps the most pleasant way is to take a leisurely ride in a horse-drawn carriage from Dominion Square.<n>Known with characteristic local irony as la Montagne (the Mountain), the heights were spotted by Jacques Cartier on his historic journey up the St. Lawrence River in 1535, and named Mont Réal in homage to his king François I.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Since 1772, the church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours, 400 rue Saint-Paul Est, has stood on the site of a chapel that was built for the colony’s first schoolteacher, Marguerite Bourgeois, but destroyed by fire. She and three young woman companions brought a civilizing influence to the harshness of the beleaguered settlement. Acting as both teachers and nurses, they also took charge of marriageable girls known as the filles du Roi, the “King’s daughters.” The filles du Roi were in fact daughters of peasants and poor artisans, shipped over from France as wives for bachelor farmers and fur traders. In the 19th century, Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours became the “Sailors’ Chapel,” to which survivors of shipwrecks brought model ships they had carved as offerings of thanksgiving. The models still hang from the ceiling, lit up now by tiny electric bulbs. Notice how the trompe l’oeil painting on the low arched ceiling aspires to turn the little church into a lofty Gothic cathedral. Climb the church tower for a good view of Vieux Montréal and the harbor.<n>Most of the ugly old warehouses have been demolished along the Vieux Port at the foot of Place Jacques-Cartier. Some have been refurbished as cafés or hotels; one pier now houses the headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil, another an IMAX theater. Take a walk along the port to Pointe à Callières, where the Ville-Marie settlers first landed. An obelisk on the nearby Place Royale commemorates their adventure. The statue at the Pointe is of an Anglo-Canadian, John Young, who developed the port’s commerce in the 19th century.<n>The rue St-Sulpice takes you over the Place d’Armes, close to the site of the first French battles with the Iroquois. Today it serves as a visual link between the historic old town of the pioneers and the new city of commerce and industry. In the middle is a statue of Maisonneuve, looking very like one of Alexandre Dumas’ musketeers. He’s brandishing the royal French fleur-de-lys flag that inspired the Québec provincial flag of today. The 19th-century Neo-Gothic Notre-Dame Basilica was designed by James O’Donell, an Irish Protestant New Yorker so inspired by his assignment that he converted to Catholicism. It once took 12 men to ring the great bell in the west tower, a task now accomplished with electricity. The garishly opulent interior was the work of a Québécois, Victor Bourgeau. Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Chapel, behind the main altar, unites modern and traditional religious art in a more intimate setting for marriages and memorial services. A little museum displays church sculpture and painting, notably some almost surreal works by Pierre-Adolphe-Arthur Guindon, a Sulpician monk. Next to the church is the Seminary of St-Sulpice, Montréal’s oldest surviving edifice, built in 1685 to lead the missionary work among the Iroquois. It also boasts North America’s oldest public clock (1710).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Start on top of the rock, where the city’s principal landmark is a hotel, the Château Frontenac, looming over the town since 1892 like the protective fortress it no longer needs. Because of its dramatic location and the fairytale turrets of its Gothic-Renaissance architecture, the Frontenac is one of the most charmingly bombastic of all the many grand hotels that the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National railways put up across the country as symbols of their commercial power. It is named after Count Louis de Frontenac, a rascally 17th-century French governor who upset the clergy by encouraging the sale of brandy to the native peoples. Take a look inside at the stucco carvings, tapestries, and handsome wood paneling.<n>Behind the hotel, beyond an 1898 statue of Samuel de Champlain, the city’s founder, Dufferin Terrace offers a magnificent view over the St. Lawrence and downriver to the Ile d’Orléans. Stroll alongside a pleasant little garden, Parc des Gouverneurs, with its obelisk paying tribute to Generals Wolfe and Montcalm, both killed at the great battle for Québec in 1759. The terrace is prolonged by the Promenade des Gouverneurs, continuing the walk along the foot of the citadel towards Battlefields Park.<n>North of the Frontenac, Place d’Armes is the center of Old Québec, where troops were mustered and paraded, proclamations read out, criminals whipped or executed. In the middle, the Monument of Faith (Monument de la Foi) commemorates the work of French Catholic missionaries in North America. On the north side of the square, the Musée du Fort, 10 rue Ste-Anne, stages a sound and light show alternately in English and French on the military history of Québec City.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Down on the harborfront today, the old wharves, warehouses, even the houses of joyous ill-repute that cluster in back streets around any international port have been refurbished as Historic Properties, a bright and breezy neighborhood of artists’ studios and galleries, shops, restaurants, and taverns with open-air terraces. The boardwalk takes you through a colorful architecture of red brick, timber, grey stone, and gaily painted clapboard. Summer attractions include a puppet theater, concerts, lobster races, and windsurfing competitions. At the international tournament of town criers, hear local newsmongers in 18th-century costume pitting their Oyez! against the best bellowers from Britain and Bermuda.<n>Anchored by Privateers’ Warehouse (Halifax was a popular haven for pirates from the Napoleonic Wars to the rum-running Prohibition Era of the 1920s) is a grand racing schooner, Bluenose II. You can walk the decks or even take a two-hour cruise on this replica of the famous 1921 champion sailship portrayed on the Canadian ten-cent coin. “Bluenose” was the Americans’ nickname for Nova Scotia’s wind-whipped sailors. If the schooner is out of port on one of its frequent goodwill tours down the Atlantic coast, there are several other harbor cruises well worth taking, to view the shipyards, naval installations, and fishing fleet, as well as the yacht clubs and elegant waterfront homes on the Northwest Arm inlet.<n>Also on the harbor, the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic (1675 Lower Water Street,) is housed in a turn-of-the-century ship chandlery, setting the tone with a nostalgic whiff of tarred rope in the restored shop on the ground floor. The museum traces the dockyards’ 200-year history, displaying naval instruments, weapons, and some superb ship models from sail to steam, including the Aquitania ocean liner. A special section is devoted to shipwrecks on the notorious Sable Island. Berthed at the museum’s wharf is the 1913 survey vessel, Acadia, that charted the coasts of eastern Canada from Nova Scotia to Hudson Bay.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
You are plunged into the atmosphere of that “moment in time” as soon as you get off the park bus at the Georges des Roches fishing property, a long turf-roofed log cabin outside the fortified town. The men may be laying out dozens of cod to dry on what are known as flakes, the same trestled wooden racks still used in fishing villages all down the coast. At the drawbridge to Porte Dauphine, the main entrance gate bearing a relief of three fleurs-de-lys, the French royal coat of arms, you’ll be stopped by French soldiers to check whether you’re a British spy.<n>If they let you through (they usually do), walk past the Dauphin bastion to the handsomely carved stone portside gate, Porte Frédéric. Turn right into the town along the main street, past the hospitable eating establishments of the Hôtel de la Marine and L’Epée Royale, where you can get a characteristic 18th-century meal served on tin or pewter plates. Continue over to the King’s Bastion, the military barracks where living conditions show the kind of stark contrast that nurtured enough discontent to cause a mutiny in that year of 1744. The gabled Governor’s Wing numbers ten luxurious apartments with fine furniture, tapestries, silks, brocades, silverware, and delicate porcelain. The neighboring Officers’ Quarters are more humble but still comfortable enough, while the ordinary soldiers’ barracks are downright miserable, with rudimentary beds of straw. In the middle of the block, a simple little chapel tries to keep the peace.<n>Back in Sydney, follow the Trans-Canada Highway west to the Englishtown exit for the ferry across St. Ann’s Bay to join the Cabot Trail at Indian Brook. This 300-km (180-mile) trail offers one of the country’s most spectacular drives, with dramatic juxtapositions of dense pine forest, sheer cliffs, and the ocean. Travel north along the Gaelic Coast, a name amply justified by the thick Scottish burr you’ll hear from most of the very friendly people you speak to on the way. At Cape Smokey, so called for the fogs that shroud it in winter and a few unlucky summer days, take the ski-lift that operates in summer for the view up and down the coast and over to the Cape Breton Highlands.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The province’s largest town (where it is the custom never to abbreviate “Saint” to ���St.”) is a port in the estuary of the Saint John River. It is the center of an important paper and pulp industry and has shipyards and oil refineries, but the city fathers have worked miracles to beautify the waterfront. Mists rising from the Bay of Fundy add a touch of romance and mystery.<n>One of the town’s main attractions is the natural phenomenon of the Bay of Fundy’s extraordinary tides, with a variation from low to high tide of 8.5 m (26 ft) at the mouth of the Saint John River. Watch the Reversing Falls Rapids from the bridge on Highway 100. The tourist information office there will tell you the best times to watch the tides’ evolution. At low tide, the Fundy’s waters are 4 m (13 ft) lower than the Saint John River, causing it to cascade through a narrow gorge into the bay. Gradually the flow slows down as the tide begins to rise again. At the tide’s turn, the slack enables ships to pass the rapids before the flow builds up in the opposite direction. The bay’s high tide of more than 4 m (13 ft) above the river thrusts all the way inland to Fredericton, 130 km (78 miles) away. On your riverside walk in Falls View Park, try to ignore the pulp mill.<n>The bright new downtown area lovingly blends a modern and 19th-century atmosphere, especially along red-brick King Street. To suit all kinds of weather, skywalks and underground galleries link shopping and entertainment centers. Market Square is the attractive hub of the harborfront renovation, a multi-level complex of shops, apartments, hotel, and cafés, surrounding an atrium in what were once just ugly warehouses. The Ocean Hawker II tug moored at Market Slip has been converted into a bar. At nearby Barbour’s General Store, an authentic 19th-century grocery, try the local specialty of dulse, an edible seaweed that is New Brunswick’s answer to chewing gum. It was at Market Slip that a contingent of 3,000 Loyalists landed in 1783 to found the city of Saint John. The event is commemorated in July by the Loyalists Days festival, with processions along the harbor and dancing in the streets, all performed in the 18th-century costume.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Bay of Fundy<n>Take Highway 1 northeast from Saint John and turn off at Penobsquis to head for Fundy National Park, a wonderful nature reserve with an emphasis on the seashore and its spectacular high tides. At the park entrance, you can get detailed maps of the 110 km (68 miles) of hiking and biking trails linking campgrounds and chalets inside the park. An arts-and-crafts school offers courses in wood-carving and copper jewelry for adults, and basket-weaving and glass-painting for children. On Bennett Lake, you can rent a canoe or fish from a rowboat. On the shore, walk along the flats at low tide to seek out periwinkles, barnacles, and sea anemones underneath the rocks. Herring Cove gives you a good view and detailed explanations of the tides.<n>Take a side-trip to Hopewell Cape at the mouth of the Petit-codiac River. If you can, camp overnight, as dawn is the perfect time to enjoy the view of its red cliffs and bizarre pillars of granite topped with tufts of balsam fir and black spruce, revealed at low tide. The rocks have been buffeted into what the tourist office calls the Grant Flowerpots.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
More than in most towns, Vancouver’s unique setting demands a carefully planned first view. The city is built around the broad English Bay, which funnels through First and Second Narrows into the Burrard Inlet, the waterway that George Vancouver explored in a scouting boat in 1791. The harbor separates the city proper, with the Stanley Park promontory, from its elegant north shore mountainside suburbs of West and North Vancouver. To take in all this, you need to begin from not one, but two observation points.<n>Cross the First Narrows on Lions Gate Bridge and take the Capilano Road for a cable-car ride, “Skyride,” up to Grouse Mountain and its grand view south over the city and harbor. Try to be there at sunset, too, to see the city light up. A favorite with skiers, the mountain also offers a fine view northwest over Capilano Lake and across to Vancouver Island. If you feel like a quick whiff of the wilderness on your way back, turn off to walk the swaying suspension bridge 76 m (230 ft) above the fast-flowing waters of Capilano Canyon.<n>To get an equally impressive view of the city set against its mountains, go downtown to the observation deck (and its restaurant, if you like) on top of the 40-story Harbour Centre (555 West Hastings Street). A bonus on clear days is a view south, with the long-range telescope, of Mount Baker across the American border in the state of Washington.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Turning west, you’ll pass on the seaward side a bronze statue oddly named Girl in a Wet Suit, a version of Copenhagen’s mermaid designed not to shock. Stop off at Prospect Point for a good view of oil tankers and grain cargo ships bound for Japan, China, or Russia. A totem pole marks the site where Captain Vancouver met with members of the Squamish tribe.<n>At the Aquarium the star attractions are the dolphin show and the beluga whales, closely followed by polar bears. Equally fantastic are wolf-eels with crab-cracking jaws. Bears and monkeys seem to be having much less fun at the nearby zoo. You can walk marked trails to picnic at the pretty freshwater Beaver Lake, from which the beavers were “deported” after creating havoc with the water system. The park’s popular sandy beaches run along the west shore of the peninsula.<n>English Bay<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Route 99 turns north at Horseshoe Bay (landing area for the Vancouver Island ferry) to become the Squamish Highway for a spectacular 100-km (60-mile) drive up to Whistler Mountain. The Coastal Mountains come right down to the water’s edge of the narrow Howe Sound, some forming a little archipelago in the sea.<n>Stop off at Shannon Falls, a short walk away from the road on an easy gravel path over footbridges into the forest. You can picnic at the bottom of the cliff over which the water cascades. Famous for its August log-rolling contests, the town of Squamish makes a useful base for hiking tours into Garibaldi Provincial Park. The winter sports resort of Whistler offers excellent summer facilities, too: bicycles, kayak and river-rafting or more sedate swimming, golf, and tennis. Take the ski-lift for views across the Coastal Mountains or stroll around Lost Lake — good trout-fishing — but beware of a pretty yellow flower known as skunk cabbage that smells like its name when you pick it.<n>As a delightful alternative to driving, you can travel from Vancouver to Squamish aboard the Royal Hudson 2860 steam train, a regular old puffer giving you a close-up view of mountain and forest. The round trip takes 6 hours, including a 2-hour stopover in Squamish allowing for a walk over to Shannon Falls. You also have the option of making one leg of the trip by sea (30 minutes longer). Board the morning train in North Vancouver at the bottom of Pember Street and return from Squamish on the MV Britannia ferry — or vice versa, starting from Vancouver’s Harbor Ferry dock at the bottom of Denman Street.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt

Coming from Vancouver, board the car ferry at Horseshoe Bay for Nanaimo and head north on Highway 19. Turn west at Parksville to cross the island on Highway 4. This takes you through some of the province’s finest forestland: the red cedar of canoes, totem poles and longhouses; stately Douglas fir, mainstay of white man’s bridges, boats, houses, and flagstaffs; and the good old Sitka spruce Christmas tree.<n>About 20 km (12 miles) from Parksville, look for a signpost to Little Qualicum Falls. The well-marked walk loops around the upper falls tumbling into a ravine, then follows the river rapids along to the lower falls that crash into another rocky gorge. You can extend the hike along the river for a picnic or bracing swim at Cameron Lake.<n>Highway 4 follows the lake shore to Cathedral Grove, a formidable stand of Douglas firs in MacMillan Provincial Park, donated to the public by a paper manufacturer as a gesture for government permission to exploit less accessible parts of the forest. Many of the firs, up to 76 m (230 ft) high, are more than 300 years old, the most ancient dating back to the 12th century. Excellent explanatory panels trace the growth of these majestic trees. Off the beaten track, you’ll steep yourself in the atmosphere of a truly primeval forest.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
From the railway depot and sawmill town of Golden, the highway turns east to one of the prettiest of B.C.’s national parks, in the mountains and quiet lakes around the Yoho and Kicking Horse rivers. Buy your food supplies at the parkside town of Field and cut back to the signposted Emerald Lake turnoff. Just inside the woods is a pleasant picnic area beside the “natural bridge,” a massive slab of rock through which the swift waters of the Kicking Horse River have forced a channel. A salt-lick just past the bridge often attracts moose at dawn and dusk. Drive on up to Emerald Lake, a place of sheer magical peace, mirroring the mountains in its perfectly still green waters. With only one secluded hotel on its shores, the pearshaped lake’s tranquillity is less troubled by noisy tour groups than some of the more popular Rocky Mountain resorts. The lake path makes a delightful two-hour ramble through woodland, giving you a good chance of spotting some of the park’s small wildlife, notably some very chubby brown porcupine and an occasional beaver.<n>Back on the Trans-Canada, the turn-off 6 km (31/2 miles) after Field takes you past the park information center to a steep winding route through the pine forests of the Yoho Valley. Signposted on the right, 13 km (8 miles) into the valley is a short walk to the foot of the spectacular Takakkaw Falls. Takakkaw is an Indian word for “magnificent,” a fair description of the waters spilling out of the outflow of the Daly Glacier. Unlike many waterfalls, this one is at its most spectacular on the hottest summer afternoons, when the glacier ice melts. For a panoramic view of the glacier, take the Highline Trail 1 km (1/2 mile) south of the falls, starting out from the Whiskey Jack Hostel.<n>On the way back, stop south of the confluence of the Yoho and Kicking Horse rivers for a view of the Spiral Tunnels. Watch trains entering and reappearing from the upper of two tunnels bored into the mountain to form a figure 8. The lower spiral is visible from the Trans-Canada Highway. This engineering feat was necessary to overcome the steep gradient of the approach to Kicking Horse Pass. At the park’s eastern exit, you’ll see where geologist James Hector, member of an 1858 expedition mapping the major passes through the Rockies, was kicked senseless by a pack horse — thus the name of the pass. From Field, you can ride through the tunnels to Lake Louise.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
This 233-km (140-mile) drive on Highway 93, up the spine of the mountain range from Lake Louise to Jasper, gives a rich sense of the Rockies’ varied beauties —  glaciers, waterfalls, lakes, and canyons. Take a full day so that you have time to explore some of the sights on foot. Stop first at the Crowfoot Glacier, where you can see the foot’s two remaining “toes,” the third having broken away. The mass of ice facing you is 55 m (165 ft) thick. At Bow Summit, leave the Parkway at the signpost to the viewpoint overlooking the lovely Peyto Lake, a deep turquoise at the height of summer. If you have time, stop at Kilometer 119 on the Parkway, to hike up the winding path to Parker’s Ridge (2,185 m/6,560 ft) above pretty alpine meadows overlooking the Saskatchewan Glacier, the beginning of the great North Saskatchewan River that ends up in Hudson Bay.<n>Inside Jasper National Park, put on good rubber or crepesoled shoes to walk out onto the ice of Athabasca Glacier, part of the Columbia Icefield. You can also venture onto the ice sheet in a snowmobile. Note the rock debris or rubble (moraine in the language of glaciologists) in front of the glacier showing that the Athabasca is retreating — a hundred years ago it reached to the other side of the Parkway. At the Parkway’s Kilometer 200 mark, take Highway 93A to Athabasca Falls. A comfortable boardwalk leads you on an informative nature walk right up to where the mighty river plunges over the narrow gorge.<n>The old fur trading post of Jasper is now a refreshingly peaceful resort town with a grand park lodge and fine facilities for rafting, canoeing, camping and other mountain sports. Take the Jasper Tramway ride up Whistlers Mountain for a view of the Rockies’ highest peak, Mount Robson. One of the most attractive excursions is the drive along Maligne Canyon. Stop off to look down into the sheer limestone gorge at the roiling waters, sudden cascades, and tranquil pools. At the end of the canyon is Maligne Lake, where the great attraction is a boat cruise around the picturesque Spirit Island.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Its vital stake in the grain and commodities market gives Winnipeg a strong financial as well as architectural affinity with Chicago, as you can see on a visit to the trading floor of the Commodity Exchange, open to the public at 360 Main (5th floor). This is just one of the town’s many modern skyscrapers clustered around the commercial hub of Portage and Main, which has the reputation of being the windiest spot in Canada.<n>In the splendid Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature (190 Rupert Avenue), prehistoric and present-day animals are presented in beautifully recreated environments of Arctic wastelands, tundra, woodland, and waterfalls, complete with bird sounds, eerie wolf howls, or the terrifying roar of a forest fire. The province’s ethnic groups are shown in traditional costume and old homesteads; special emphasis is given to Manitoba’s Indians and a Métis buffalo hunt. Be sure to walk around the reconstructed decks of the 17th-century Nonsuch ketch that pioneered Hudson Bay’s involvement in the fur trade.<n>The museum adjoins the Centennial Center, home of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, Manitoba Opera Association and Royal Winnipeg Ballet. If you’re not around for the ballet performances there from October to May, look out for the summer Ballet in the Park shows in Assiniboine Park, west of town off the Trans-Canada Highway.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Tennis: Most urbanizaciones and large hotels have their own courts. Public courts are few and far between.<n>Walking: All the islands except Fuerteventura and Lanzarote are good for serious walkers.

Farther along the coast road, 8 km (5 miles) past Buenavista del Norte, lies the most westerly point on Tenerife, the Punta de Teno. From here there are panoramic views across to La Gomera and looking south to the massive cliffs of Los Gigantes. Turn back to Buenavista and take a marked turn inland to Masca. Be warned, though, this is absolutely not a drive to be undertaken by inexperienced or nervous drivers. Initially the road, although ascending through the arable mountainside, is no problem; but this soon changes once the entrance to the vertiginous valley is reached. One glance at the narrow, steeply twisting road on either side will be enough to realize why, up to only a few years ago, the picturesque tiny village of Masca could only be reached on the back of a donkey. All around is some of the most dramatic scenery on the island. However, if you are driving, you won’t have any time to savor it. The road clings precariously to the side of lush, green mountains cleft by deep, dark ravines and often zig-zags on itself in the tightest of hairpin bends. And it is far from unknown to have to reverse back down and around these bends, allowing other vehicles to pass. A stop at Masca is not just a pleasure, but also a relief. Relax at one of the restaurants down from the road, and enjoy the stupendous scenery before continuing south on an equally difficult drive, to rejoin the main road at Santiago del Teide.<n>A little farther south, turn off towards Puerto de Santiago, then walk out to the edge of the marina jetty to get the best view of the enormous sheer cliffs, up to 800 m (2,625 ft) high, known appropriately as Los Gigantes (The Giants).<n>The Central Area<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
There are several approaches to Las Cañadas National Park and Mount Teide. The park is well sign-posted from the road via La Orotava, but if you are coming from the north, then the most picturesque route is via La Esperanza. The small town soon gives way to a lush forest of giant pines and eucalyptus trees. Four km (21⁄2 miles) south at Las Raíces is where Franco met with his co-conspirators in 1936 (see page 20). An obelisk in the forest commemorates the event. As the road gains altitude and temperatures fall, the views become ever more spectacular. The Mirador Pico de las Flores looks out over to the southeast and the Mirador de Ortuño offers a panorama of the northern coast. Highest of all at over 2,000 m (6,562 ft), Mirador las Cumbres reveals Teide in all her glory.<n>The entrance to the National Park is El Portillo de las Cañadas, where there is a visitor center (open daily 9am–4pm). If you wish to walk in the park, pick up a leaflet or ask for information about the daily guided walks. Note that during winter the environment can become quite harsh, and you should never undertake walks without consulting staff at the visitor center first. At this point it is quite likely that you will be in the clouds; temperatures are very low, and in winter there may well be snow on the ground. The landscape becomes very lunar-like; it was around here that some of the filming for Planet of the Apes took place. The ascent to the top of Mount Teide can be made by climbing, or by the new cable car (teleférico), an eight-minute ride (open daily 9am–4pm, admission: 2,500 ptas, r15.03). Most visitors choose the cable car, but it’s worth noting that even after leaving the cable car it is still a good climb to the summit at 3,717 m (12,195 ft). However, if you really want to venture that far you have to go in person and with a photocopy of your passport, to the Office of the Parque Nacional del Teide (Calle Emilio Calzadilla, 5, 38002 Santa Cruz de Tenerife). Even then, there is a daily limit of just 50 people, for conservation sake, allowed up the last 200 m (219 yards) to the summit. Once there, you should be able to count off all the other Canary Islands and, on a good day, see North Africa. Impressive as Teide is, it is basically no more than a peak on the edge of a giant volcano which long ago erupted or imploded. Left behind is the vast Caldera (volcanic crater) which is most apparent from the area known as Los Roques. Los Roques are a group of giant, flamboyantly shaped lumps of volcanic rock rising out of the crater; often visited and photographed.<n>The East and South Coast<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
Bustling Las Palmas, (population 450,000 — the largest city in the Canaries and the seventh largest in Spain), is a major commercial and historical center, a cosmopolitan resort, and a vital seaport all rolled into one. It is one of the busiest ports in the world.<n>The real hub of Las Palmas is the Parque de Santa Catalina. This square is effectively one gigantic outdoor café that buzzes day and night, and is just a short walk to Playa de las Canteras. This superb golden beach stretches for 3 to 5 km (2 to 3 miles) and a natural reef just offshore means that the water couldn’t be calmer. Las Canteras and the area behind it reflect the city’s cosmopolitan nature. Like the city in general, it has seen better days and is losing younger tourist trade to the smarter modern resorts in the south.<n>Away from Las Canteras make your first stop Doramas Parque, a pleasantly landscaped park named after a Guanche island chieftain, and adjacent to the park is the Pueblo Canario (Canary Village). This is a romanticized version of a Canarian village where you can shop for handicrafts and watch displays of folk dancing and singing. The man who conceived it was local artist and designer Néstor de la Torre (1888–1938), and a museum of his exotic art is in the Pueblo.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
The South ofthe Island<n>Arrecife, the principal port and latter-day capital is a characterless place with just two saving graces — the Castillo de San Gabriel and the Castillo de San José. The 16th-century Castillo de San Gabriel, situated close to the center of town, houses a small museum of no great standing. But it is worth the walk across the small drawbridge and over the lagoon, onto the small island that the castle used to deter pirates. The Castillo de San José, a few kilometers, to the north, is a far more interesting proposition. Built in the 18th century, this well-preserved fortress that once guarded the harbor it overlooks, now houses the late César Manrique’s small but impressive International Museum of Contemporary Art. This includes works by Picasso and Miró, and is also notable for the contrast between the modern exhibits and the ancient structure that houses them.<n>The island’s major resort is Puerto del Carmen and its long golden beach stretches for about 5 km (3 miles) and comfortably accommodates its visitors. The sea is calm and ideal for families. Restaurants of every conceivable type, bars, and shops line the Avenida de las Playas, Lanzarote’s one outbreak of mass commercialism.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
The numerous coves (narrow bays with rocky walls found all along the coastline), are a perfect environment for small, brightly colored tropical fish. Xcaret is probably the most famous site, but you can enjoy snorkeling at Xel-Ha and Trés Rios as well.<n>Not yet qualified to dive? Both SNUBA and BOB are half-and-half water experiences. With both you are underwater, but with a constant supply of air from tubes at the surface. BOB, the Breathing Observation Bubble, is a kind of underwater scooter with oxygen helmet. Contact Hotel Cancún Marina Club, km 5.5 (Tel. 98/83-4440), for details. With SNUBA you wear a helmet, but you walk on the ocean floor. Contact AquaWorld in Cancún for further details.<n>Other Activities<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhatToDo.txt
This location had many natural attributes in its favor. Twenty-seven kilometers (17 miles) long and less than a kilometer wide, the island is shaped like the number seven, and separated from the Yucatán peninsula by only 10 m (33 ft) of water. Its eastern shoreline is one long beach of fine white sand (there are seven named beaches along the strip), which is washed by the translucent azure waters of the Caribbean. Between the island and the mainland is Laguna Nichupté, a huge seawater lagoon bounded by mangrove swamps that are havens to numerous species of wildlife.<n>Today a string of hotels have taken much of the beachfront real estate; the balance given over to bars, nightclubs, and shopping malls. On the lagoon side, watersports and eco-tours abound in the calmer shallow waters. Blue signs denote public beach access and there are no restrictions, so you can walk the island’s full length without concerns about trespass. All in all, Cancún has everything needed for the perfect relaxing vacation.<n>Finding your way around the resort couldn’t be simpler. There is only one main thoroughfare, Kukulkán Boulevard, running the full length of the island, and every hotel and attraction is only a few strides from it. The addresses of most hotels or restaurants will include their position on Kukulkán Boulevard in kilometers; the farther south, the bigger the number. This guide explores the island from north to south, giving the exact location of attractions in kilometers to make it easy for you to find what you need. You could rent a vehicle of some sort to travel back and forth to your hotel, but there is a very reliable and inexpensive bus service stopping regularly, and usually directly outside the major hotels, at intervals along the route. The buses run from early morning to midnight.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
Most ferries deposit you at the very northern tip of the island, on the main pier of the only town on Mujeres. Craft shops and bars crowd onto the sidewalks and sandy streets. The place bustles, especially when the ferries arrive. As afternoon turns to evening and the day-trippers head back to Cancún, Isla Mujeres takes on a much quieter character. The island has many loyal fans that return year after year for its particular atmosphere. Many who choose to stay come for the diving, which usually means low-key entertainment and early nights.<n>A few minutes’ walk north of town is the main beach, Playa Norte, also known as Coco Beach. It has sheltered waters and fine sand, particularly suitable for children. Coconut palms provide shade and a few pelicans fly overhead in search of a meal.<n>Heading south out of town you’ll pass the Mexican naval base and a small commercial airstrip before traveling alongside Laguna Makax on the right. The water here, guarded from the Caribbean Sea by the island itself, has been used for centuries as a safe harbor during storms and hurricanes. Pirate fleets stopped here, because passing naval vessels would not see their ships.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
From Punta Sur the main highway heads north up the eastern coastline. The conditions here offer quite a contrast to the west, with the waves of the Caribbean lashing against limestone rocks, and the low vegetation leaning inward, blown by the sea breezes. The whole area has a stark and wild beauty, reminiscent perhaps of the time when Cozumel was the haunt of pirates and renegades. The tidal surge is very strong here, so swimming and snorkeling are not advised. Other than a few farms, there is little development until you reach Playa Morena, with its bar and souvenir stand. Here the road makes a sharp left turn to cut across the heart of the island. If you wish to continue north from here (on foot, horseback, or four-wheel drive vehicle), you will eventually reach the northern lighthouse at Punta Molas, having passed the Mayan ruins of El Castillo Real along the way. Take the sensible precautions if you make this trip — drinking water, sun protection, insect repellent, and an extra layer of clothing are all advisable.<n>The road leading back to San Miguel, called the Carretera Transversal, hosts a few souvenir stands where prices may be a little lower than in town — if you’re prepared to barter. Six km (4 miles) from Playa Morena is the entrance to the San Gervasio Archaeological Park. The remains of San Gervasio are located several kilometers from the site entrance, and though not on the scale of the major Mayan settlements of the mainland, the beautiful tropical park environment makes the ruins worth exploring. Most structures date from the post-classical period (1200–1650); the site was still in use when the Spanish arrived. At the Estructura Manitas (Little Hands Structure), you can clearly see the red handprints, dating from around 1000, on the inside wall of the temple. From here you can walk the route of a short sacred sacbé (Mayan road) to the central collection of small buildings. One is El Osario (Ossuary Structure), where the remains of several Maya were found. Some 500 m (1,524 ft) behind here is Kana Nah (Tall House), which, as its name suggests, is one of the largest structures at the site. It was the main temple, where the goddess Ix chel was worshipped.<n>South to Tulum along theMaya Riviera<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
At Cobá it is possible to feel a little as Stephens and Catherwood did when they discovered the Mayan sites in their expeditions of 1841. Most of the pyramids and temples still lie under centuries of debris and vegetation, tantalizing visitors with intricate carvings peeking through roots and branches. Here you can imagine yourself to be exploring where no one except the abundant birds and butterflies has been for centuries. Cobá more than any other site requires sensible footwear, hat, sunscreen, and bottled water, because the principal structures are spread so widely apart.<n>The main building at the site is the Iglesia or church, a huge pyramid nearly 30 m (90 ft) high. It sits among a number of structures known as the Grupo Cobá, which lie to the right of the main entrance. Its major staircase has been cleared, and the view from the top is spectacular, with the lakes and jungle stretching out to cover the land. At irregular intervals, vegetation-covered mounds indicate other pyramids yet to be freed. The only other large structure in view is the stone façade of Nohoch Mul (Big Hill) some 20 minutes’ walk away. At 42 m (138 ft), Nohoch Mul is the largest Mayan pyramid yet discovered; there are 120 steps to its upper platform. Once there you will find images of the Descending God — the same image seen so often at Tulum. Between the Nohoch Mul group and Grupo Cobá is Conjunto de las Pinturas (Paintings Group) where you can see the Pyramid of the Painted Lintel, which as the name suggests still bears traces of its original coloring.<n>West to Chichén Itzá and Mérida<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
The Forbidden City, so described because it was off-limits to ordinary people for nearly 500 years, is now called the Palace Museum. Designed to contain the auspicious number of 9,999 rooms, its scale is overwhelming and leaves many visitors bewildered. Built in the years 1406–1420, it was the residence of 24 emperors for nearly seven centuries.<n>Tourists normally enter the Forbidden City from the south, after a long walk along a cobbled roadway from the Gate of Heavenly Peace. The main entrance to the compound, Meridian Gate (Wumen), was designed in the 15th century. Officials used the left portal, members of the imperial family the right. Next comes another ceremonial gate, the Gate of Supreme Harmony (Taihemen), first erected in 1420. A pair of monumental bronze lions stand guard.<n>Beyond this powerful defense line stands China’s supreme ensemble of ancient architecture. First and foremost is the Hall of Great Harmony (Taihedian), popularly called the “Hall of the Imperial Throne.” This is the biggest building in the Forbidden City and one of China’s most beautiful wooden structures. For hundreds of years during the Ming and Qing dynasties this was the tallest building in all Beijing; by law no house could rise higher. (Counting the hall’s upswept roof decorations, that meant the limit was approximately 371⁄2 m, or 123 ft.) Inside, on a raised platform, the “Son of Heaven” sat on his Dragon Throne surrounded by symbols of longevity and power and cowering acolytes, all covered in a fog of incense. To the tune of gongs and chimes, visitors knelt to kowtow nine times.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
The first elements of the wall system were built more than 2,000 years ago, but the expansion and consolidation of the project near Beijing began under the Ming Dynasty in the 14th century. The serpentine stone bulwark and elevated highway became Wanlichangcheng — “The Wall Ten Thousand Li Long” (about 6,000 km/3,700 miles).<n>The restored section of the wall at Badaling, undulating up the unexpectedly steep hillsides, can be a test of a tourist’s endurance. It is far steeper and more formidable than it looks in any tourist brochure. Out of breath, many visitors exchange sympathetic smiles along the way as they ascend to one or another of the towers. If you walk far enough west, you come upon unrestored sections of the wall at the edge of the Gobi Desert.<n>The Badaling section is often overcrowded these days. Two other sections now provide relatively easy access to tourists: the Great Wall at Mutianyu, as beautiful as the section at Badaling but a little less steep, and the Great Wall at Simatai, more distant from Beijing than other sections but virtually unrestored. Simatai is the least crowded and most original of the Great Wall sites. Although it too has a cable-car concession, Simatai bills itself as “the most dangerous section of the Great Wall.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
The sightseeing you remember best might be the lively free market lining the hundreds of steps that descend higgledy-piggledy from the hills of central Chongqing to the river. Hustling, bustling peasants hawk the rich harvest of the surrounding farming country: cabbages and oranges, eggs and live chickens (they are weighed while flapping), river fish and squirming eels, and table after table of the most fragrant spices, while stalls and hole-in-the-wall cafés heat up the city’s number-one dish, the Sichuan hotpot.<n>Leading down to the river’s edge, the steep stone stairway known as the Gate to the Sky (Chaotianmen), which appears not to have been cleaned since the Ming Dynasty, is treacherously overlaid with mud and muck, so wear your safest shoes and walk with care. Happily, at the bottom of this long descent there is a terminal for the funicular that returns you to the top of this town, which is so hilly bicycles are almost unknown.<n>Sights worth seeing in town include the Chongqing People’s Hall, built in 1953 to serve as a 4,000-seat conference hall and hotel. It blends the styles of the Ming and Qing dynasties with the needs of a modern conference hall. The Chongqing Museum, while poorly-lit and aging, does contain a collection of dinosaur eggs and two 3,000-year-old wooden boats that, suspended from the cliffs of the Yangzi, served as caskets for nobles in the days of the Ba Kingdom. Perhaps the liveliest sight in Chongqing is the 1,000-year-old Luohan Temple, where blind fortune-tellers and devoted followers of Buddha converge from dawn to dusk.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
The café life in Dali is one of its chief delights. Cafés are perfect spots to wile away the sunny hours over coffee or beer or to meet local Bai people as well as other travelers. Perhaps the most famous of the dozens of cafés is Mr. China Son’s Cultural Exchange Café, run by Uncle Li (Heliyi), the first Bai in history to go abroad. His autobiography, on sale at his café, is an epic soap opera.<n>Dali also has sights and attractions well worth attending to when the café and bistro scene begins to pale. Erhai Lake is a 30-minute walk from town, and its main village, Caicun, is a maze of unpaved alleys and mud houses. Ferries cross the lake to even more remote villages, including the temple dedicated to Guanyin (goddess of mercy) on Putuo Island. Any of dozens of local travel agents can quickly arrange an excursion to lakeside villages, including the market at Wase. One popular diversion is the Monday morning outdoor market at Shaping, 30 minutes up the eucalyptus-lined road by minibus from Dali. It’s a vast market of country wares, batik, and horse-trading, with hundreds of locals dressed in their traditional bright Bai jackets, tunics, and plumed caps.<n>The chief monument at Dali is the Temple of the Three Pagodas (Santasi), founded in 825. The tallest of the three towers, all sealed up, rises to 16 tiers. The complex is ringed by hundreds of stalls, many of them selling specimens of the local marble. There are also temples and pagodas in the steep foothills of the Cangshan (Green Mountain) range. Although seldom open, they provide the perfect ornaments for a day’s hike from vista to vista over this long, narrow valley that reaches west to Tibet.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Southeast of the city is Thousand Buddha Mountain (Qianfoshan), but instead of a thousand Buddha images you’ll find a hundred today. And, at only 280 m (about 900 ft) above sea level, it is more a hill than a “mountain.” But a hike up the hill and down again permits a close look at old temples, grottoes with Buddhist statues, and refreshing forests.<n>Of all the springs in Jinan, the one with the most historical associations is the Jet Spring (Baotuquan). It was from this spring in the 17th century that the Qing Dynasty Emperor Kangxi took a swig and pronounced it the “First Spring Under Heaven.” It is now surrounded by a carefully landscaped park. A short walk away is Black Tiger Spring (Heihuquan), its sweet water roaring from the mouths of three tigers carved in a black stone cliffside.<n>As the provincial capital, Jinan is the site of the Shandong Provincial Museum, where more than 400,000 items illustrate local history and nature. The highlight of the collection is an exhibition of Longshan Black Pottery found near Jinan — an elegant, delicate ware fired 4,000 years ago.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
From the busy harbor square, overlooked by the balconies of the venerable Lujiang Hotel, you can stroll into old-town areas along Zhongshan Road, past dozens of antique shophouses and cafés. Or you can head south along Minzu Road and take in the life of the fishing boats and warehouses on the quays.<n>If you walk long enough (or hail a taxi), you end up at Nanputuo Temple, nestled in the hillside on the east shore of the harbor. This Buddhist complex is in immaculate condition, its marble a gleaming white. Locals are always on hand, burning incense and praying for good fortune. The rocky cliffs behind the temple make for fine hiking and picnicking.<n>South of the temple and past Xiamen University (founded in 1921 by a local who made good in Singapore) is the Huli Mountain Cannon Platform. In 1921 the Germans placed their artillery here to defend the colonial port of Amoy, as Xiamen was known to Westerners. From here, if you look across the Formosa Strait on a sunny day, you can make out the disputed islands of Mazu and Jinmen. Once known to Western politicians as “Quemoy” and “Matsu,” these islands figured in the Nixon-Kennedy presidential debates of 1960. Today, the “cold war” between China and Taiwan, often waged with loudspeakers and leaflet bombardments across the Formosa Strait, appears to be over, and the two islands have been opened to tourism by Taiwan.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Founded by Phoenician traders more than 3,000 years ago, it came under Carthaginian and Roman rule before falling to the Moorish invasion force in 711. The Moors fortified the city, developing the settlement into a major trading port serving Granada, and it was one of the last cities in Spain to be re-conquered by Christian forces in 1487.<n>A good place to begin a tour is at Málaga’s principle landmark, Gibralfaro (from the Arabic Jebel al Faro — Lighthouse Hill). Located some 130 m (425 ft) above the city, this hilltop is capped by the ramparts of a Phoenician castle reconstructed in the 14th century by the Moors (who went on to build the lighthouse that gave Gibralfaro its name). The restored walls and parapets offer a superb panoramic view of both the city below and the coastline disappearing into the horizon. Because it looks down on the Plaza de Toros, the hill also acts as free seating for bullfights taking place below. Although it is possible to walk here, it is not recommended. Not only is the pathway somewhat difficult in places, it is also a well-known hangout for muggers. Best, then, to take a taxi.<n>Back at sea level is the delightful Paseo del Parque, with contrasting fountains at either end, which connects the old town with the Plaza de Toros. On its south side, it is a lush seaside tropical garden enhanced by fountains, duck ponds, and small bars. The other side is home to the smaller Jardínes Puerta Oscura and two impressive buildings, the Ayuntamiento (Town Hall) and the 18th-century La Aduana (Old Custom House).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Immediately behind here is the sprawling Alcazaba fortress/palace complex that the Moors built between the 11th and 14th centuries. A cobbled path climbs up the hillside within the walls to the portal dubbed Arco del Cristo (Gateway of Christ). The victorious Christian army of Ferdinand and Isabella celebrated mass here when the fortress finally fell into their hands in 1487. Higher still, the one-time palace (a disappointment compared with those in Granada and Sevilla) contains a small archaeological museum. Beside the entrance to the Alcazaba are the partially excavated ruins of a Roman theater, the only visible remains of the ancient city.<n>A short walk away is the cathedral, known locally as La Manquita — the one-armed lady — because one of its twin towers remains unfinished. The north tower soars 100 m (some 330 ft) above the street, but work on the other, a forlorn stump of stone, stopped in 1783 because of a lack of money.<n>Málaga was the birthplace of Pablo Ruiz Picasso, though the young artist left his native city at age 14 for the more cosmopolitan climates of Madrid and Barcelona. The house he was born in, Casa Natal Picasso at Plaza de la Merced 14, doubles as a small museum and research center. On a larger scale is the nearby Museo de Bellas Artes (Fine Arts Museum), an old Renaissance-style palace with pleasing patios. In late 1999, it was being converted into the future Museo Picasso (Picasso Museum).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Mijas<n>Eight kilometers (5 miles) inland from Fuengirola and clinging to the hillside is Mijas. Surrounded by modern villas and urbanizaciones (developments), it looks from the outside like any other quaint village with whitewashed houses. But Mijas is different. Most of the houses have been converted into upscale shops, restaurants, or bars, making the village itself a unique tourist attraction. Traffic is banned from the center, so if you don’t feel like the short walk from the parking lot, take a mule taxi.<n>Mijas has Spain’s only square bullring, and across from it, beautifully tended gardens slope down to a cliff-top mirador, with fine views all along the coast. There is another mirador beside the car park. On one side of this natural balcony you will find a tiny chapel dedicated to the Virgen de la Peña (Our Lady of the Mountain), set in a grotto carved from living rock.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Although known as long ago as the Phoenician era, Jerez first came to prominence under the Moors in the 11th and 12th centuries, and it is from that period that the impressively walled and towered Alcázar dates. Inside is a simple but elegant mosque that was later converted into a chapel dedicated to Santa María la Real. Re-conquered by King Alfonso X in 1264, it became one of the most prosperous towns in Andalucía after the discovery of the Americas and the reunification of Spain in 1492.<n>Below the Alcázar lies the Colegiata (Collegiate Church), a towering dark stone cathedral dating from the 17th to 18th centuries. Housed within is the precious image of Cristo de la Viña (Christ of the Vineyard). It was the development of the sherry wine and brandy business that brought the city worldwide acclaim and more prosperity. It is impossible to walk the streets without recognizing bodegas (wineries) of prestigious old firms such as Harvey, Williams & Humbert, Gonzalez-Byass, and Pedro Domecq. As some of the names imply, it was a group of English merchants who launched Jerez as the world capital of fortified wine.<n>Three centuries on, their descendants continue to control the sherry trade. All the larger companies offer tours of their bodegas, mostly on weekday mornings, and some require you to reserve in advance. Traditional hospitality means of course that every tour ends with a tasting session.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
This is an ideal island to put on your walking boots and take to the countryside. You will be well-rewarded, with small remote villages, hidden churches, and a rural lifestyle to explore. Though Cretans are bemused as to why anyone would want to hike without any purpose but the pleasure of it, they have a genuine welcome for travelers on foot. Itineraries can range from easy flat short walks to steep mountain hikes, though it’s not advisable to head into the high peaks without a guide.<n>Gorge walks are particularly popular; the Samariá is the busiest and the longest. Other gorge walks include Imbros near Samariá, and the Valley of the Dead at Zákros on the eastern coast. The peninsulas off the northwest coast present dramatic and interesting walks. Akrotíri is the most populated though not as rugged as Gramvoússa and Rodópou, which are wild and windswept. Shorter itineraries could include the walk from Agii Déka to Górtis; from Mália to the Minoan site to the east; or from village to village in the Amári valley.<n>Diexodos is a company that organizes guided hiking tours either by the day or longer. They can supply equipment and extra insurance if you need it. Contact them at Tel./fax (0841) 28098.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhatToDo.txt
Iráklion was a thriving port in Minoan times and became known as Herakleium under Roman rule. The arrival of the Venetians changed the town’s fortune. They chose it as their capital, bestowing the name Candia on both the city and the whole island. Candia blossomed with the riches of Venetian trade, and when Turkish forces stormed the island, the town held out for several months before falling into the Moslem hands. It became a relative backwater of the Ottoman Empire only to rise to prominence again following union with Greece. It was declared capital again in 1971, taking the title from Chaniá in the west.<n>The city center lies within the walls of a vast fortress started by the Venetians and reinforced by the Turks. It is possible to walk along the walls, which seem to be swallowed up by the higher modern buildings of the city, to gain an impression of how large the citadel once was. The heart of the city is tiny Venizélos Square (Plateía Venizélou) with its fringe of cafés and restaurants. At its center, the Morosini Fountain dates from Venetian times, though the somber lion statues are three hundred years older. Formerly waterspouts, these now stay dry. From this square — known to tourists as Lion Square — most of Iráklion’s attractions are only a few minutes’ walk.<n>South, on 25 August Street (Odós 25 Avgoustou), you will see the impressive façade of the Venetian Loggia, originally dating from 1628 but reconstructed after a later earthquake. It now houses Iráklion’s City Hall. Walk through the loggia to find the Church of Ágios Títos. Founded at the end of the first millennium it is named in honor of St. Titus, the island’s patron saint who was charged by St. Paul to convert the Cretans to Christianity. When the church was consecrated, his body was laid to rest within the walls. The Venetians took his remains to Venice when they fled the island and the church was rebuilt as a mosque after an earthquake in 1856, giving the incongruous but beautiful decoration on the outer walls. In 1966 the Venetian authorities returned the skull of St. Titus to the Cretan people in a gold reliquary, along with fine paintings depicting scenes of the saint’s life. They are now on view inside. Head across 25 August Street to a small park — El Greco — named after the painter, a native of Crete, whose true name was Dominicos Theotokópoulos. Here you can sit under the shade of the trees away from the noise of the traffic.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt

Here you can sit under the shade of the trees away from the noise of the traffic.<n>Continuing along 25 August Street leads to the waterfront and the majestic sight of the Venetian fortress (Koúles), built to protect the old harbor. You’ll also see the vaulted remains of large arcaded asenali (ship repair yards) that serviced the Venetian fleet. The fortress sits out on the breakwater and you will walk past the city’s fishing fleet to reach it. Small colorful boats with piles of yellow nets are waiting to set sail for the next day’s catch. The fortress was completed in 1540 to protect the town against the Ottoman threat. It proved a fine defense and was instrumental in Candia’s ability to hold out so long in the siege of the city throughout the 1660s. A tour of the interior reveals a strong and efficient design. There are panoramic views of the city and the surrounding countryside from its ramparts.<n>A short walk west along the waterfront brings you to the remains of the Dominican Monastery of Áyios Pétros (St. Peter), which is in the process of renovation, and beyond that is the Historical Museum of Crete, housed in a remarkable building — part Venetian mansion and part modern glass edifice. This museum concentrates on Cretan history from the fall of the Roman Empire to the present day. There are exquisite icons and other religious paintings rescued from churches across the island, fine stone carvings, and examples of textiles and embroidery in a re-creation of a traditional Cretan home. Models and prints of Iráklion through the centuries show how the cityscape has developed. The struggle for Cretan independence is given a prominent position in the museum, as is the only painting by El Greco still on Crete.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt

Here you’ll be able to stroll past stalls selling fresh produce and souvenirs, or eat at the numerous small ouzeries that serve the market workers. At the southern end of Market Street is Kornárou Square (Plateía Kornárou) where you will find the Bembo Fountain (Kríni Bembo) created in the 16th century using numerous pieces of architectural salvage — including the fine torso of a Greco-Roman statue.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt

The small church immediately next to it is the Church of Ághios Minás, which has a splendid ornate iconostasis — if the church is closed ask in the cathedral as the custodian here has the key. Behind these two churches is the 15th-century place of worship that gives the square its name; Church of St. Catherine (Agía Ekateríni). The church originally belonged to the religious community of St. Catherine’s monastery in the Sinai (now part of Egypt), and it acted as a center of learning. Today it houses the Museum of Icons and Sacred Objects — a wealth of art from churches and monasteries across the island, including six large icons by celebrated Cretan artist Mikhaíl Damaskinós.<n>Walk west from Lion Square along the pedestrian street of Dhedhálou (Odós Dhedhálou) to reach the major attraction in the city — the Archaeological Museum. From Dhedhálou run a number of small alleys with up-market cafés and restaurants where you’ll find Iráklion’s young and affluent enjoying iced coffee and a game of backgammon. There are some good restaurants here serving fine Greek and international cuisine.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
The golden era came to an end in 1450 b.c. and major fire caused catastrophic damage around 1350 b.c., but though the palace was completely destroyed the site continued to be occupied until the 5th century a.d.<n>The palace was erected around a large Central Court, used for public meetings, which now forms the heart of the site. Imagine Minoans at play here as depicted on the pottery and frescoes in the Archaeological Museum in Iráklion — acrobats and dancers as well as the famed bull leapers. Visitors enter past what remains of the West Court used as an entryway to a West Wing, where the administrative and religious activities took place. Minoans would walk down the corridor of processions past frescoed walls to reach the propylaia (sacred entranceway). A Grand Staircase then led north to the most important official chambers within this wing, its sturdy painted colonnades typical of those found throughout the palace. The lower floor here houses the throne room with ornate griffin frescoes and a lustral basin for ritual purification. The gypsum throne is the oldest in Europe and traces of paint show that it would have been brightly colored when in use. The walls — lined with stone seats thought to have been used by advisers or councilors — would have been decorated with red plaster and an ornamental dado. In the northeastern corner was a crypt where a cache of treasures was unearthed during the excavations.<n>A staircase by the throne room leads to what Evans christened the piano nobile — an upper floor of the west wing. Next to the staircase is the Tripartite Shrine where the Linear B alphabetical tablets were discovered.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
To reach the ancient sites drop down from Agía Vavára on to the Plain. Near the village of Agía Déka — named after ten saints who were martyred here — and widely scattered in farmland, are the remains of Górtis (Gortyn), capital of the island during the Roman era (from 65 b.c.) and also an important city in Minoan times.<n>Górtis is such a huge site — at its height it had a population of 300,000 — that you will see signposts to remains lying in the midst of crops south of the modern road. By all means, stop to enjoy them, or leave the car in the village and walk around. You’ll be well-rewarded, with ancient columns resting against olive trees, shards of pottery among the grass blades, and a Governor’s palace and amphitheatre to explore. Stop at the Byzantine church in the village — you’ll find stone from the ancient site used here too — and see the stone execution block of the martyrs. Their tomb can be viewed through the gate of a nearby crypt.<n>The main site (the one with the admission fee) covers only a tiny part of the whole, but it protects one of the most important archaeological finds on the island — the Code of Laws dating from the Dorian period, around 500 b.c. The huge stone tablet was incised with script dictating codes governing daily life including rules on marriage, property, and inheritance rights. The remains of a small theater lie just in front of the code area, and the site entrance is dominated by the apse of the 6th century basilica of Ágios Títos (St. Titus). The remains of the saint were originally interred here but were moved to Iráklion following Arab raids which destroyed the rest of the building in 825.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Shepherds watch their somnolent flocks; farmers hand weed their vegetable patches; laden donkeys make their way relentlessly towards home; at harvest time the smell of ripe grapes and apples fills the air — this is Lasíthi. The small settlements are almost ghostly silent save for the crochet needles of the old ladies or the clicking of old men’s worry beads at the kafenion. Stop in Ágios Geórgios to visit the Folklore Museum and look for the remnants of hundreds of small windmills that once powered water pumps. Now only a few still turn in the breeze, and irrigation is more high-tech.<n>On the southern edge of the plain is a large cave said to be the birthplace of Zeus — the Dictean Cave (Dictéon Ántron). Though no proof can be put forward for this claim, from the ancient votives left in the cave it was certainly very important during Minoan times. It is a 15-minute walk from the parking lot, or you can take a mule ride up the narrow path. Be aware that the surface underfoot is very slippery, and take a flashlight for better visibility. The cave drops precipitously 65 m (213 ft) into a dark cavern where the imagination begins to work overtime — what demons could lurk here? A guide will help to point out details that your untrained eye might miss — such as the monstrous face of Kronos here to eat his new offspring Zeus, and the small nipple shaped stalagmites on which the infant god is said to have suckled.<n>The Dictean Cave is one of Crete’s most popular excursions and is very busy in the peak of the day. The surrounding area is also replete with souvenir stalls and ceramics workshops that either spoil the view or delight the shopper, depending on your point of view.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Réthymnon has also been the intellectual center of Crete throughout the ages and still boasts a School of Philosophy. In August each year it draws intellectuals and artists from across Greece for a Renaissance Festival.<n>The Old Town occupies a strategic position on a nub of land jutting out from the long flat coastline. A huge fortress — the Fortezza — dominates the site, its walls rising high above the streets on the northwestern point. This is thought to be the largest fortification ever built by the Venetians, who completed the task in 1586. The finest views of the walls are from the promenade on the waterfront. As you walk you can truly appreciate its grand scale. Once inside it is easy to imagine a large garrison and its entourage being based here, though there are few buildings left to explore. There is a small, whitewashed Orthodox chapel and the remains of barracks and arsenals. Ottoman forces made surprisingly light work of taking the fortress in 1646. They worshipped in a large mosque in the center of the fortress, whose interior you can explore. Perhaps the most exciting part of the tour is the view over Réthymnon old town from the parapets on the eastern side — myriad tiled rooftops lead down to the harbor beyond. There are also views east and west along the bay.<n>Immediately outside the entrance to the fortress is an old Ottoman garrison building now housing the Archaeological Museum of Réthymnon. The collection covers finds from the Neolithic age onward and concentrates on Minoan finds in the ‘lesser’ (if one can use such a phrase for finds of this quality) sites, as there are no major palaces in the area. Cave sites have rendered some particularly interesting votive artifacts. Excavations of tombs have also been fruitful and the museum displays some beautiful clay sarcophagi.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
If you want to take time for lunch make a point of stopping at Chóra Sfakíon. There are several good tavernas along the waterfront of this small village. You’ll also find a memorial to allied soldiers of WWII here, as the port was an evacuation point after the Battle of Crete in 1941. It is not possible to travel further west by road because the looming Levká Mountains meet the sea here. Boats pick hikers up from the base of the Samariá Gorge and at busy times rows of tour buses await their return. You can take boat trips to the island of Gávdos, the most southern territory in Europe, and to Loutró, a picturesque village with no vehicular access; or head inland on foot for Loutró and the remains of ancient Anópoli for an enjoyable day’s hiking.<n>Heading north by road once more, your journey will take you through the spectacular Imbros Gorge with its recently released population of Bald Eagles (among other birds of prey). This gorge is more accessible than nearby Samaria and you can walk down through it by leaving your car at the village of Imbros or up from Chóra Sfakíon as the gradient is not too steep (8 km/5 miles).<n>West toward Chaniá<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
and the Samariá Gorge<n>The White Mountains (Lefká Óri) dominate the western part of the island. The highest range on Crete, with several of its peaks breaking 2,000 m (5600 ft), there are no villages in its shadow because the mountains rise steeply with no perceptible foothills. This is an untamed landscape, rugged and stunningly beautiful, with narrow valleys incised between limestone peaks that wear a mantle of snow until the early summer months. Yet in spite of this the mountains host one of Crete’s most impressive, popular, and enjoyable excursions — the 16-km- (10-mile-) walk down the Samariá Gorge.<n>The gorge is the longest in Europe and starts in the heart of the mountains at a mighty 3,352 m (11,000 ft). In winter its path carries melted water from the peaks above. Only in the mild conditions of summer, when the torrent turns to a trickle, are people allowed to follow its path. The journey brings home the true power and wonder of nature. High walls of stone, ancient cypress trees, rare orchids, and soaring birds of prey can all be seen, along with glimpses of the wild Cretan goat — the kri-kri — bounding between precipitous crags.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Park wardens give you a ticket, to be surrendered at the other end to ensure that no one is left stranded in the gorge at the end of the day, and the descent begins at the xilóskalon (wooden staircase). With the wall of Mount Gíngilos towering above, the stone path drops sharply away in a series of switchbacks, falling 1,000 m (3,280 ft) in the first three km (2 miles). Slippery scree slopes fall below, so take it easy and keep to the path.<n>The route becomes less steep once you reach the rest point at the chapel of Ágios Nikólaos, 4 km (2 1⁄2 miles) in, where there is a picnic area. The freshwater pools are inviting, but swimming is strictly forbidden. The abandoned village of Samariá, with its 14th-century church of Ossia Maria (Mary’s Bones), marks the halfway point. People lived here until 1962; now there’s only a warden’s post and first-aid station. Beyond is the gorge’s narrowest point, the Sideróportes (Iron Gates), only 3.5 m (11 ft) wide but 300 m (1,000 feet) high, a truly humbling sight and the most memorable, for from here the gorge opens up as it approaches the sea and is much less striking. The final stretch is perhaps the most grueling as you walk along the shadeless riverbed but at Agía Rouméli you’ll have perhaps the most delicious drink you ever tasted!<n>Excursion to Santorini<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Now make for Guadalest (some 10 km/6miles to the east), the Costa Blanca’s famed “eagle’s nest” fortress, built by the Moors 1,200 years ago. Inaccessible except for a tunnel carved through 15 metres (50 feet) of solid rock, Guadalest was never conquered, though James I of Aragon took it by siege during the 13th-century Reconquest. The fortress even withstood an earthquake in 1644, as well as attempts by the Austrian Archduke Charles to blast his way in during the War of the Spanish Succession. Guadalest itself is just as spectacular as the view from it. Wandering round the compact castle, you’ll understand why, for lack of space, the belfry had to be built outside, and why the picturesque old cemetery is so small.<n>From Guadalest, the road leads to the small town of Callosa de Ensarriá, centre of the honey industry, where you can taste before you buy, often six or eight different flavours. From Callosa take the Parcent road, follow it for 21⁄2 km (11⁄2 miles), and make a right-hand turn at the entrance to the El Algar waterfalls, a tumbling oasis beneath the massive Sierra Bernia formed by a tributary of the River Guadalest. Leave your car in the parking area and walk to the 27-metre (80-foot) falls. You can swim beneath them in chilly waters, then picnic by the cool, leafy pools above. It’s easy to get away from crowds in this pleasant spot, but if you’re in the mood for company, you’ll find lots of people in the restaurants near the car park.<n>The next stop is Tárbena (10 km/6 miles farther along the C-3318), an invigorating mountain village famed for its delicious sausages. They’re made from a secret recipe handed down to the present-day villagers by their Mallorcan ancestors, who came here in the early 17th century as part of an official repopulation scheme.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
Before you leave the sanctuary, visit the Capilla Mayor (Main Chapel). The strangest of the cathedral’s treasures is contained in an urn here — the heart of Alfonso the Wise, bequeathed to Murcia by the 13th-century king long before his death.<n>Go out of the cathedral on the north side and walk across Plaza Hernandez Amores to the cool and classy Calle de la Trapería (Street of Secondhand Merchants). But don’t look for bargains here; the name of this pedestrian thoroughfare belies the elegance of its shops. At the north end you come upon the Casino (a private club, not a gambling establishment), with spirited turn-of-the century decor. The entrance hall, an exact copy of the Hall of Ambassadors in Seville’s Alcázar, and the ladies’ lavatory — with its ceiling of cherubs — are the most magnificent rooms. (Don’t forget a small tip to the steward who shows you around.)<n>During the Casino’s heyday, the pedestrian Calle de la Platería (Street of Silversmiths), at right angles to the Trapería, was full of practising craftsmen. Flower stalls in the Plaza de las Flores are open every morning. After 11:00 a.m., vendors tend to retreat into nearby shops and bars, particularly in hot weather.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
The walls surrounding Old Havana were razed during the 19th century to allow the city to expand westward. The long, curvaceous, and crumbling Malecón (breakwater), a six-lane highway alongside the city’s north shore, links the districts of Central Havana and Vedado. The victim of harmful salt spray, the seafront drive is now more a seafront dive. At its eastern end, primary-colored buildings — a showcase of tragic splendor — seem to fall apart before your eyes. Havana’s youth congregate along the Malecón on fine evenings, flying kites, necking, swimming off the rocks, and setting out to sea in giant inner tubes to fish.<n>Although most visitors will want to concentrate on historic and museum-like Old Havana, the newer districts provide a fascinating view of the areas where most people live and work. The most interesting districts of New Havana are Central Havana and Vedado. The former is a congested, lower-middle-class barrio with few attractions for visitors, although a walk along its dusty streets and crumbling façades can be an eye-opening experience. Vedado is the city’s principal commercial and residential zone — the epicenter of middle-class Havana — with parks, monuments, hotels, restaurants, theaters, and the University of Havana. Once the stomping grounds of the elite in the 1950s, the “suburb” of Miramar today is home to the offices of rich foreign companies investing in Cuba and the diplomatic missions of foreign governments.<n>Central Havana (Centro Habana)<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
Business is centered on La Rampa, the name for Calle 23 from Calle L to the sea. Opposite the tower-block Hotel Habana Libre — the Havana Hilton in pre-revolutionary days — is the Coppelia ice cream park. At this institution, locals queue for hours for the prized ice cream, eating several scoops in one sitting or ladling them into saucepans to take home. Hard-hearted foreigners paying in dollars down their scoops in a cordoned-off area. Coppelia was instrumental in the award-winning Cuban film Fresa y Chocolate (“Strawberry and Chocolate”), a daring film about freedoms and revolutionary fervor in contemporary Havana (its title is a wry reference to the lack of choices of ice cream flavors — indeed, of all things — in Cuba).<n>A short walk up the hill brings you to the University of Havana, founded in the early 18th century, a quiet, attractive campus of neoclassical buildings. English-speaking students eager to meet foreigners are numerous here. Directly east on Calle San Miguel, between Calles Ronda and Mazón, is the fine and surprising Museo Napoleónico. The mansion boasts not only Empire furniture but also a remarkable collection of Napoleonic memorabilia: busts, portraits, and even his pistol, hat, and death mask from St. Helena. The house and contents were acquired by the state from a rich owner in 1960.<n>In the same year, the government acquired the Museo de Artes Decorativas, at Calle 17 between Calles D and E. Each room in this grand 19th-century villa is furnished in a particular style: English Chippendale, Chinese, baroque, or Art Deco in the fabulous bathroom.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
A dashing equine statue of Agramonte forms the centerpiece of Parque Agramonte, just to the south. The cathedral occupies one side of the park, and the Casa de la Trova (see page 82), around a floral patio, features musical performances afternoon and evening.<n>A ten-minute walk west down Calle Cristo brings you to a dignified 18th-century church, Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje (Christ of Good Travels), perfectly named for out-of-town visitors. Behind the church is a great sea of crosses and marble saints in a picturesque cemetery; church officials claim it is wholly unrelated to travels that didn’t go so well. A few blocks north, the Convento de Nuestra Señora del Carmen (from the early 19th century) was in a disastrous state in early 2000, though workers were busily rebuilding it. Just enough of the structure remains to make plain that it would be stunning if carefully restored.<n>Camagüey’s finest feature — and marvelously restored — is Plaza San Juan de Dios, an angular old cobblestoned square surrounded by brightly hued, single-story buildings dating from the 18th century plus a lovely yellow church alongside a restored former hospital. It’s one of Cuba’s most beautiful plazas. A few blocks south, near the river, is an impressive agricultural market open every day and stocked with a surprising surfeit of meat and produce.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
A place of great import (and considerable beauty) to all Cubans is the triple-domed Basílica del Cobre, named after the nearby copper mines that rise out of the forested foothills 18 km (11 miles) west of Santiago. Cuban faithful make annual pilgrimages to the church to pay tribute to its statue of a black virgin, the Virgen de la Caridad (Virgin of Charity). According to legend, Cuba’s patron saint was rescued bobbing in the sea in the 17th century by three young fishermen about to capsize in a storm. With the wooden statue in their grasp, they miraculously made it to shore. Pilgrims, often making the last of the trek on their knees, pray to her image and place mementos and offerings of thanks for her miracles; among them are small boats and prayers for those who have tried to escape Cuba on rafts. The Virgen is on the second floor, encased in glass and cloaked in a glittering gold robe.<n>You can take a taxi to El Cobre for around US$15 roundtrip, although more adventurous sorts can hop a máquina (vintage American automobile taxi) or colectivo (bus or truck) out to the town and walk the mile or so to the church. If you’d like to stay overnight in this spectacular (and deathly peaceful) area, there is a hostal, Hospedería de la Caridad, behind the church, where foreigners who abide by the strict rules can stay for a mere five pesos a night (see page 133).<n>East of Santiago is Parque Baconao, a biosphere reserve spread over 40 km (25 miles). The local dark-sand beaches can be scrubby and the hotels themselves are isolated, but there’s lots to explore in the park, and the Sierra de La Gran Piedra rise majestically above the coast.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
As you hike, whether with a fully loaded backpack or just a light daypack, you can’t help marveling at the burdens that porters carry in their dokos (baskets). Everything not made or grown in the villages has to he packed in on the backs of wiry, barefoot porters, who carry loads of as much as 60 kg (130 pounds). Even more amazing is the fact that these baskets have no shoulder straps but only tump lines (forehead straps). You may notice that going downhill, porters take short steps on the balls of their feet with their knees bent. Do the same and you’ll avoid the common complaint of “trekker’s knee.”<n>Along the way you’ll see hill people working their terraced fields of maize (corn), barley, buckwheat, millet, and, in the high country, potatoes. Buffaloes and goats are milked, and millet is threshed by pounding the stalks on the threshing floor. Women and girls troop to and from water taps with their water jars, while small children rock babies slung in baskets under the thatched eaves of stone-walled houses. Grain is taken to water-driven mills for grinding, or in some cases is ground between two flat stones or pounded in a mortar by a foot-operated rocker-beam pestle. In recent years numerous hydroelectric projects throughout the Annapurna and Solu-Khumbu regions have brought moderately reliable electricity to remote villages. However, this electricity is usually only available for a few hours in the evening. With electricity available, it is now possible to watch CNN (via satellite dish) from a remote lodge many days’ walk from the nearest road.<n>If you are trekking in the Annapurna region, you will at times have to give way to caravans of ponies, mules, and donkeys crowned with red and white yak-tail plumes. In the Khumbu region, it will be caravans of yaks themselves (or yak-cow cross breeds) carrying the packs. Give the yaks a wide berth, and always stay on the uphill side of the trail as they pass.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
Solu-Khumbu: the Everest region (5 days–3 weeks). The shortest possible trek for a close view of Mount Everest and Sherpa country in Sagarmatha National Park is a five-day dash with round-trip flights between Kathmandu and Lukla. The trail goes up the Dudh Kosi river valley through lovely woodlands with an overnight at Phakding or Jorsale. The next night is at Namche Bazaar, where there is a Sherpa market on Saturdays. Return is by the same route with an added night at Lukla to be on hand for one of the (often cancelled) early morning flights back.<n>Add two days for the interesting switchback walk from Namche to the Thyangboche Monastery and back, or ten days for the circuit that goes on to Pheriche, Lobuje, Gorak Shep, and Kala Patar for one of the greatest of all Himalayan views. It is also possible to continue on to the Everest Base Camp area at an exhausting 5,360 m (17,586 ft), although there is not much to see at base camp (no view of Everest). Add another week (for a total of 20 to 21 days) if you hike in from Jiri (reachable from Kathmandu by bus or taxi) and then fly out of Lukla. Add yet another 5 days if you walk back out to Jiri.<n>Around Annapurna (1–3 weeks). Fly to Pokhara and head for Ghandruk via Dhampus. This route provides superb views of Macchapuchhare, the spectacular Fishtail Peak. Continue to Ghorapani, which sits high above the valley of the Kali Gandaki River. Separating Dhaulagiri and Annapurna 1, the Kali Gandaki forms the world’s deepest valley. Return to Pokhara in five to six days via Poon Hill and Birethanti. Or add ten days round-trip and continue from Ghorapani to Tatopani and Muktinath through Thakali villages along the old salt-trade route to Tibet.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
Turn right at this intersection, and then left where two lions flank a passage leading to a striking white Buddhist stupa in a large courtyard. This is the Kathesimbhu temple, built in the mid-17th century in the style of Swayambhunath (see page 42) as a service to devotees physically unable to climb up to that hilltop shrine. There are several masterpieces of sculpture here, as well as a bahal, or monastery, one of 120 tucked away in courtyards of the city.<n>At this point, continuing to Thahiti Tole, where there is another small stupa, you can walk north to the main intersection of Thamel, Kathmandu’s lively, fast-spreading center for budget-conscious tourists. Guest houses, restaurants, curio vendors, rug shops, trekking agencies, bicycle and motorcycle rental stands, and bookshops line the way. Some guest houses have pleasant gardens, and most are clean and quite inexpensive, though in recent years more expensive hotels have also opened in this neighborhood. Many low-budget guest houses have bulletin boards where trekkers leave messages for friends or advertise for trekking companions.<n>From Thamel’s center you can return to your starting point by heading right, or east, to a roundabout. Back in the modern part of town you come to the Kaiser Library. This has nothing to do with the German emperors, but was built by Field-Marshal Kaiser (a distortion of the Nepali name Kesar) Shumshere Rana. The tall trees surrounding this building, which also houses part of the Ministry of Education, are the daytime roost of a colony of large fruit bats that trade places at dusk with flocks of crows. Inside the library there are old photos of assorted Ranas, smartly dressed in tweed suits, neckties, and polished boots, posing atop the huge rhinos and tigers they’ve slain.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
At the summit is one of the oldest stupas in the world, an immense white mound surmounted by a golden cube, on the four sides of which are the astonishing all-seeing eyes of Buddha. Above this rises a tower of 13 diminishing golden disks symbolizing the 13 steps to enlightenment, then a golden royal parasol topped by a bell-shaped crown. Strings of prayer flags stretch from the tower’s pinnacle, and around the base are hundreds of small prayer wheels. While pilgrims circumambulate the stupa, monkeys, dogs, and pigeons clamber about and forage for scraps of food offerings in small altars set in the foundation.<n>The typical Nepali mix of Hinduism and Buddhism is almost immediately in evidence. At the top of the stairs stands a huge dorje, the tantric thunderbolt symbol. To the left of this (remember to walk clockwise around the stupa) rise two shikara-style votive towers to Hindu deities. On the side of the stupa opposite the stairs is a very popular pagoda temple to Hariti Devi, a Hindu goddess who protects against smallpox and children’s diseases. This temple, too, has Buddhist prayer wheels around it, worn shiny by the hands of the devout.<n>Adjacent to this temple, within a cage to prevent their theft, are two images alternately described as the White Tara and the Green Tara (Buddhist deities) and as Ganga and Jamuna (Hindu deities). A bronze peacock accompanies these two figures. There is a small forest of white chaitya shrines behind the Hariti Devi temple, and a porch to one side where pilgrims congregate to prepare meals in offering for the goddess.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
Duck through a low passage between two shops across the street to find the Til Mahadev Narayan Temple. It stands in an un-touristy rubble-filled square where there are families washing, goats looking out of upstairs windows, and, behind a grill in a small kiosk, a lingam much venerated by older women, who keep it covered with flowers.<n>Bhaktapur expanded over the centuries from a nucleus around the Tachupal Tole, reached by a walk from the Nyatapola Temple through narrow streets full of unfamiliar merchandise: the lengths of red yarn are sold to be plaited in women’s hair; the gray cannonballs are homemade soap, the conical yellowish cigarettes are bidi, the cheapest tobacco, and can be bought singly. There will be heaps of orange turmeric, cardamom, ginger, and other spices, and bundles of dried fish, looking like twigs. Pan sellers offer to mix lime, spices, and bits of nuts and tobacco in a fresh betel-leaf packet for chewing. Bigger leaves stuck together with bamboo toothpicks are sold as plates for temple offerings.<n>Many of the old houses around Tachupal Tole have been very carefully restored. At one end is the Dattatreya Temple, used impartially by Buddhists and Hindus. Two large wrestlers, symbolic of the first Malla, a strongman, flank the open porch of this structure, and a gilded Garuda kneels on a column above. In an alley just off the square is the famous Peacock Window of intricately carved wood; the window is part of the Pujari Math, a former priest’s house that now houses the National Woodworking Museum.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
From Kathmandu, short trips to the valley rim make it possible for those with limited time to see the high mountains at sunrise or sunset.<n>Nagarkot, which stands on the crest of a ridge at 2,195 m (7,200 ft), is about an hour’s drive from Bhaktapur and one of the best places in the Kathmandu area for viewing the Himalayas. From this aerie on the rim of the Kathmandu Valley, 322 km (200 miles) of the Himalayas stretch out before you in an immense wall of rock and ice. Although there are excellent views from the many lodges and hotels here, the view is even better from a nearby observation tower, which can be reached in about an hour’s walk from Nagarkot. From this observation tower, it is possible to see as far as Mount Everest. Most visitors come for the sunrise or sunset on the mountains, and though the weather is often at its clearest in the early morning, low clouds and fog often obstruct the view.<n>The Kathmandu area’s other popular mountain-viewing spot is the village of Dhulikhel, which has a view very similar to that from Nagarkot and is a bit easier to reach, since it is on the main highway to Tibet. This highway passes through Banepa, where you can turn off to visit Panauti. The buildings here have great artistic and historic importance and for this reason have become the focus of a French-funded restoration project. Today, this out-of-the-way village offers a fascinating glimpse into the Kathmandu Valley’s small-town life. Dhulikhel, on the other hand, is strictly about mountain views. Here there are several attractive hotels, including one with tropical gardens, that cater to visitors hoping to catch a glimpse of the Himalayas at sunrise or sunset. At dawn and dusk, the otherwise perfectly spectacular mountains are made just that much more breathtaking as they are painted in shades of lavender and pink by the rising and setting sun.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
Some 200 km (124 miles) west of the capital by road and half an hour by air, Pokhara is a major staging point for treks and one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. Almost as spectacular as the flight to Everest, the air route to Pokhara heads in the opposite direction, paralleling the high mountains toward Annapurna. Below, all signs of roads disappear, and it is clear how difficult road-building is in this tortuous terrain. The town, at 900 m (3,000 ft), is almost tropical, with bananas, papayas, and poinsettias growing in gardens. The contrast makes the stunning views of snow-capped Machhapuchhare, the famous “Fish Tail” peak dubbed the “Nepalese Matterhorn,” all the more marvelous.<n>Pokhara, on Phewa Lake, has the best views for the least expended energy of any location in Nepal. The Lakeside neighborhood, jammed with cheap hotels and restaurants, is where most Westerners congregate to rent bikes, shop for Tibetan wares that are sometimes cheaper here than in the capital, and drink cheap beer. On the airport side of town, there are several luxury hotels, and one of these, on the lake itself, is reached by a hand-drawn ferry. This is a starting and ending point for trekkers, and as such is filled with a mix of people in anxious anticipation of their impending adventure and those who have recently returned from exhausting treks. Everyone seems content to fill up on cakes and pies. Day hikes are a popular activity here, with the most popular hike being that to Sarangkot to see Dhaulagiri and the Annapurnas from the viewing tower. Other good walks include a visit to the Tibetan refugee camp at Tashiling and to the Peace Stupa atop the forested hill on the south side of the lake. You can also take a boat out on the lake or walk to Devin’s Fall, where a river disappears underground into a steamy hole. While most people look on this as a staging point for a trek, Pokhara is such a beautiful spot that it can be quite enough just to relax and enjoy the mountain scenery in the warm sunshine.<n>The road back to Kathmandu follows the Seti River for much of the way. A side road makes it easy to visit Gorkha, ancestral seat of the Shah dynasty and city from which the unification of Nepal was begun. Prithvi Narayan Shah’s large palace here has been restored by wood-carvers, and you can climb for half an hour up to the stronghold, which is now inhabited by priests. Looking out of a window onto the panorama of high mountains and wave upon wave of rolling hills, one can imagine the young prince saying to himself “This must be my kingdom.” In recent years Maoist activity in the area has limited the number of people visiting Gorkha.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
Montmartre<n>Montmartre is really a hilltop village (“La Butte” to its residents), with narrow, winding streets and dead-ends. For the last 200 years it has been associated with artists and bohemians. The Montmartrobus spares you the walk and shows you some of the area in a single tour, but the best way to discover Montmartre at your own pace is to start early, at the top. Take the métro to Abbesses and the elevator to the street (the stairs here are endless) and notice the handsome Art Nouveau entrance as you leave. Rue Yvonne le Tac leads to the base station of a funicular railway. It was here that St. Denis was martyred (see page 13) and where St. Ignatius Loyola launched the Jesuit movement in 1534.<n>The funicular (it takes métro and bus tickets) climbs to the terrace in front of the Byzantine-style basilica of Sacré-Cœur. Standing at the highest point in Paris, it’s one of the city’s principal landmarks, and one of the few to remain perennially controversial. Artists still scorn it as a vulgar pastiche, and the working-class residents of the area resented its being erected as a symbol of penitence for the insurrection of the 1871 Commune — they didn’t feel penitent in the least. The Sacré-Cœur’s conspicuous whiteness comes from the local Château-Landon limestone, which bleaches on contact with carbon dioxide in the air and hardens with age. For many, the best reason for visiting the basilica is the view of the city from the dome or the terrace below.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
At the far end of rue Lepic, a market street renowned for its food shops, is place Blanche, where everything suddenly changes. You hit boulevard Clichy, or it hits you. Right on the corner is the Moulin Rouge, still staging its nightly cabarets, mostly to package tourists. All the way east to place Pigalle and beyond runs a ribbon of tawdry nightlife, with sex shops, peep shows, and other dubious attractions, punctuated by a few conventional restaurants and bars. By evening, tour buses from all over Europe are parked bumper to bumper. Avoid the late-night métro here, unless you want to share it with reeling drunks.<n>The principal cemetery of Montmartre, where luminaries of the arts such as the composers Berlioz and Offenbach lie buried, may seem a world away, but it’s only a short walk west from the Moulin Rouge to the entrance (west past the Moulin Rouge, then right at avenue Rachel).<n>Le Marais<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
Geographically if not temperamentally part of the Left Bank, the Palais-Bourbon is the seat of the Assemblée Nationale (parliament). Designed for a daughter of Louis XIV in 1722, it makes a stately riverside façade for the 7th arrondissement, with its 18th-century embassies, ministries, and private mansions (hôtels particuliers). Napoléon added the Grecian columns facing the Pont de la Concorde, but the palace is more graceful seen from its entrance on the south side. Access is available only on written request or invitation by a deputy. A privileged few get to see the great Délacroix paintings in the library, illustrating the history of civilization.<n>The Prime Minister’s splendid residence, Hôtel Matignon at 57 rue de Varenne, is a short walk from the National Assembly. Its private park has a music pavilion favored for secret strategy sessions. On the same elegant 18th-century street, the Musée Rodin at number 77 houses the sculptor’s works in the delightful Hôtel Biron (see page 75).<n>Most important sight in the neighborhood is the monumental Hôtel des Invalides, established by Louis XIV as the first national hospital and retirement home for soldiers wounded in action. At one time it housed approximately 6,000 veterans, but Napoléon took over a large part of it for the Musée de l’Armée (Army Museum). Then the Invalides came to symbolize the glory of Napoléon himself, when his remains were finally brought back from St. Helena in 1840 for burial in the chapel under the golden Dôme. His son, who died in Vienna, is buried in the crypt, his remains transferred here by Adolf Hitler in 1940.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
Perched on the edge of the Bairro Alto is one of Lisbon’s most evocative sights, the shell of the 14th-century Igreja do Carmo, which was packed with worshippers on All Saints’ Day, 1755, when the terrible earthquake brought the roof down. The church remains deliberately preserved as an atmospheric ruin. Nearby, the sumptuous 16th-century Igreja de São Roque features a lavish baroque chapel of São João Baptista (St. John the Baptist) and a small museum of sacred art.<n>You can easily walk to the Bairro Alto from the central squares in the Baixa, but it’s also fun to go by tram or board the landmark 30-m (98-ft) Elevador de Santa Justa, which you’ll find just off Rossio square. The stately elevator, a 1902 Victorian marvel of iron and glass, was built by Raul Mesnier (not Gustave Eiffel, as many continue to believe). The longer, slower route back downhill meanders through the elegant shopping area of Chiado, now totally rebuilt after a drastic 1988 fire that swept through the district.<n>Some 6 km (4 miles) west of Praça do Comércio along the river lies the riverside district of Belém. Many of the great voyages of discovery set out from here in the 15th and 16th centuries. The new sea routes produced a golden age of commerce, and King Manuel built two magnificent monuments to commemorate the country’s achievements.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
The main city in the region is Castelo Branco, invaded by the Spanish so often that little of historical interest survives. It is still a pleasant city, with small cobbled alleyways leading up to the ruined “White Castle” at the highest point of the town. The Paço Episcopal (Bishop’s Palace) is home to a regional museum, displaying a splendid collection of highly elaborate colchas (bedspreads), as well as 16th-century tapestries. The elegant formal Palace Gardens are laid out with an array of baroque statues, sculpted hedges, fountains, and pools. The nearby Miradouro de São Gens affords a good view of the city.<n>The atmospheric and intensely Portuguese village of Monsanto, located about 50 km (31 miles) to the northeast of Castelo Branco, balances on a dramatic rocky outcrop between massive boulders. The streets are too narrow for cars, but a short walk to the castle at the top is worth the effort for the impressive stonework and the view. A beautiful, but roofless, 13th-century Romanesque church can also be seen. A new pousada has just opened here.<n>THE NORTH<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
Further north, the beach resorts of the Minho’s Costa Verde are at least clean, even if none too warm. The nearest one to Porto is the twin resort area of Vila do Conde/Póvoa de Varzim, 27 km (16 miles) to the north. Vila do Conde is the decidedly more pleasant and less developed of the two.<n>Póvoa do Varzim is a short walk north from Vila do Conde, but is a much livelier and more built-up resort, with a casino. An interesting diversion inland from here is to Rates, where you can add a dash of culture to the days spent on the beach by looking around the beautiful 11th-century Romanesque church.<n>The Douro Valley<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
Braga is known for its churches, but it has many splendid Baroque mansions as well. Just west of city center is Palacio dos Biscainhos, built in the 17th century (the decoration is 18th-century). The house reflects the refined lifestyle enjoyed by the nobility, with azulejo panels showing falconry, displays of Chinese porcelain, and delightful gardens. South of Praça da República, the magnificently blue-tiled Casa do Raio, known as the Casa do Mexicano, is now a hospital.<n>Beyond Braga is one of the north’s most frequently photographed sights, the 18th-century pilgrimage church of Bom Jesus do Monte, situated in the mountains 4 km (2 miles) east of Braga. The twin-towered Baroque church is principally notable for the grand staircase that leads up to it. It is lined with chapels featuring the 14 Stations of the Cross, lichen-covered statues, urns, and fountains. The devout climb all the way up on their knees; the less committed can walk or take the funicular railway and stay in one of the three hotels located at the top.<n>Barcelos<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
Only eight blocks wide, San Juan can easily be covered on foot, though there are some steep ascents that may be challenging in the Caribbean heat. Even if you only have one day, you’ll be able to enjoy its delights. If possible, however, take at least a couple of days. Enjoying a rest in a shady plaza or taking a long lunch at an outdoor café are just as much a part of your trip as a tour around the museums. San Juan is a living city, and it’s especially bustling after dark, when crowds throng to the bars and restaurants or simply stroll the narrow streets and airy plazas.<n>Begin your exploration at Plaza de Colón (Columbus Square). If you take a taxi from the outlying resort areas, this is a good place to alight — before traffic in the narrow streets forces your vehicle to a halt. The square was named after Columbus on the 400th anniversary of Puerto Rico’s discovery, in 1893. After admiring the unusually tall statue of the discoverer, leave the square from the northeastern corner and walk along Boulevard del Valle; this is a pretty street with a series of brightly painted buildings, but the traffic can be busy.<n>At the top of the hill, on the right, you’ll find the towering walls of Fuerte San Cristóbal, the largest fort in Puerto Rico. It’s also the youngest fort on the island, built in the 18th century to plug a hole in the easterly defenses of the city. From atop the brick walls, which withstood fierce attacks by cannonballs and other projectiles, you can enjoy panoramic views out to the east and over San Juan Bay to the modern city. The fort’s vast interior courtyard now echoes with the sound of running children rather the marching of soldier’s boots, but one dormitory of the old barracks has been re-created, with bunks lining the walls and uniforms hung neatly on pegs. Take the long dark walk to the dungeons to find a faded drawing of a Spanish galleon sketched on the wall by a captain accused of treason.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt

Here you’ll be tempted by fine views of the sea; you may even catch sight of a cruise ship sailing gracefully into port. This route sits against the old city walls, which were completed in 1785, and from here it is easy to see why the city was thought to be impregnable. Thanks to the high, thick walls and the watch-towers with their distinctive rounded roofs, the residents could be sure that no one would approach unseen.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt

Thanks to the high, thick walls and the watch-towers with their distinctive rounded roofs, the residents could be sure that no one would approach unseen.<n>After a walk of about half a mile you’ll find the plain façade of the Museo de Arte e Historia (San Juan Museum of Art and History) on your left. Once a major market place for the city, built in 1855, the building now houses a major collection of Puerto Rican art.<n>Just past the museum, a large, open grassy area comes into view. If you happen to be here on a weekend you’ll find thousands of Puerto Rican families out flying kites. This area is the best place to take advantage of the sea breezes, and many kites soar hundreds of feet up in the air. When collisions occur or lines get crossed, jovial banter breaks out between the parties — it’s a very social activity. The grassy area, cut by one gravel path, leads to the end of the promontory — and the mighty Fuerte San Felipe del Morro, usually simply referred to as “El Morro” (meaning “the headland”). On your right as you walk toward the entrance you’ll pass the old city cemetery resting between the walls and the sea. The ornate tombs are still carefully attended and hold the remains of some of Puerto Rico’s most illustrious families. The entrance to El Morro is reached across a wide dry moat, a last defense against attack. Walk through the huge curved doorway to the heart of the fort.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt

Walk through the huge curved doorway to the heart of the fort.<n>El Morro was one of the most formidable citadels in the world. During the 16th and 17th centuries it was one of a ring of forts that held the key to Spanish power in the Caribbean. The watchtowers of El Morro look out to sea and inland across San Juan Bay to the coastal plains beyond. The multilevel defenses made it possible to fire weapons from sea level up to hundreds of feet above ground. Despite some serious attempts by English and Dutch forces, the fort was never forcibly taken.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Since 1845 the lighthouse here has provided protection for ships off the coast; the present light dates from 1908. The old barracks and ammunition arsenal now house a museum, which offers an audio-visual presentation about the history of the fort (in English and Spanish on alternate half hours).<n>After exploring the fort, walk back across the grassy lawns. (At the small traffic circle at the end of the driveway you’ll find refreshment stalls where you can get a cool drink or snack before moving on.) Young Puertorriqueños have taken to skateboarding and rollerblading on nearby Plaza del Quartel Ballajá. They gather every day at this square to compete with their peers and show off their skills to passersby.<n>To the left is Cuartel de Ballajá (Ballajá Barracks), once the major army barracks under Spanish rule and now a significant cultural attraction. The second floor of the building houses the Museum of the Americas. The museum’s mission is to gather collections of artifacts of Amerindian culture, including folk art, basket-ware from Colombia, and ceremonial masks and costumes from around Central America.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Behind the museum are a number of other important attractions. Take Calle las Monjas toward San Juan Bay. After a short distance you’ll arrive at the western wall and a small square, Plazuela de la Rogativa, with a bronze statue commemorating the torchlight religious procession, or rogativa, that saved the city in 1797. It’s believed that the lights held by the bishop and the women of the city fooled the British forces in the bay into assuming that Spanish reinforcements had arrived. The British fled empty-handed.<n>Just a short walk north of the square is the Casa Blanca (White House), which for 250 years was the home of the descendants of Ponce de León. Something of a mini-fortress, safe behind its own high wall, the house itself is fascinating — the interior is a museum to life in 16th- and 17th-century San Juan, with many rooms full of period furniture.<n>Walk back toward the Plazuela de la Rogativa and peer over the city wall, which rises over 100 ft (301⁄2 m) at this point. The plain façade is broken by the San Juan Gate, which was once the only entrance to the city from the old port. The gate was constructed in 1639, and the walls were completed in 1641. Every person who traveled across the Atlantic from Spain would enter through this narrow passage — many would make their way directly to the Cathedral to give thanks for a safe arrival — and all goods were transported through here. The thick wooden doors are an impressive sight; they were locked and guarded each night but now remain open to allow people to stroll along the seafront.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Take a left and a block farther down you’ll enter Plaza de Armas. This was the first central square of Old San Juan, and the City Hall, or Alcaldía, still sits on its northern side. The army used to drill here, hence the name (armas means weapons, or arms), but today it is simply a place for people to meet and have a coffee, or sit and chat. Workers enjoy picnic lunches here at midday; old people while away the afternoon. The Alcaldía has an interesting interior, with checkerboard marble floors and magnificent chandeliers. It’s usually open on weekdays; you can check with the tourist information office on the ground floor as to whether it’s OK to wander around.<n>Back on Calle Fortaleza, walk east until you reach the Casa de Callejón (House of the Alley) on the corner of Callejón de Capilla. A fine example of an 18th-century house, it is now the Museum of the Puerto Rican Family, full of the furniture, toys, and other daily artifacts of a well-to-do San Juan family.<n>Taking a left out of the museum brings you back to Plaza Colón, from where you can make your way south toward San Juan harbor. Along the way you’ll pass Teatro Tapia (Tapia Theater) named after Puerto Rican playwright Alejandro Tapia y Rivera. The splendid façade was restored in 1976, the interior remodeled in 1987. The theater hosts regular performances of ballet, dance, and drama, often showcasing works by modern Puerto Rican writers and choreographers.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
The whole area is a place of staggering proportions: there are over 200 species of native trees. One specimen is said to be over 2,500 years old; some trees are so wide it takes several people to reach around them; others soar hundreds of feet into the air. The forest gets over 180 inches (41���2 m) of rain each year — that’s some 100 billion gallons (450 billion liters) of water. The animals that live here are also amazing. This is one of the last habitats of the threatened Puerto Rican parrot. The infamous coquí (see page 47)is, of course, heard everywhere. All in all, the park in an impressive sight, with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance.<n>Arriving via Route 191 you’ll come right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park. This facility presents important information about the history of the park, its plant and animal species, and its role in the local ecology. You can then travel on higher into the park, toward the summit. You can’t drive the whole 8 miles (13 km) between the visitors center and the end of the road, but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way, so there’s ample access. Two popular stops are La Coca Falls, on the right after the 5-mile (8-km) point, and the Yokahú Observation Tower, at the 51⁄2-mile (9-km) point. Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes. The most spectacular cascade in the park, La Mina Falls, is just a 30-minute walk from the roadside, via Big Tree Trail.<n>Take a walk on any of the well-marked trails: the atmosphere is humid and the vegetation constantly damp (your best friends will be your insect repellent and your stout shoes), but the landscape is beautiful and fascinating.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt

There is a popular balneario at Luquillo, which has restrooms, snack bars, and a children’s play area. The beach is kept tidy and there is ample parking.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Culebra, much smaller at 21 sq miles (34 sq km), is north of Vieques. It is the largest rock in a collection of over twenty that attract sailors and divers from the main island. Culebra was known as the Spanish Virgin Island until the American takeover — it lies halfway between Puerto Rico and St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. Its only town is named Dewey, after Admiral George Dewey, a hero of the American-Spanish War of 1898. The local people are more apt to call it Pueblo.<n>Culebra is full of natural beauty: beaches (Flamenco is the most celebrated), clear waters full of marine life, and land awash with flowers. Most people come just to sit on the beach or walk in the fresh air. Much of the island is now managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, to preserve the environment. It makes an interesting day trip from Puerto Rico and a total contrast to hot days in the streets of Old San Juan.<n>The Southeast<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Puerto Rico’s second city, Ponce is as much steeped in history as Old San Juan. Founded in 1692, it was named after a relative of Juan Ponce de León, not the famous explorer himself. Ponce is a thriving port city, very modern in many ways, but it lives up to its name of “Pearl of the South.” At the very heart of the city is a jewel of an old town, well-preserved thanks to a massive and expensive restoration program begun in the 1980s. Hundreds of careworn buildings were brought back to life, and power cables were buried underground and out of sight. Along with this physical transformation came a cultural change: Ponce has become a focus for social events that celebrate Puerto Rican history and tradition; several major festivals are held here throughout the year.<n>The focus of the city is Parque Degetau in Plaza Las Delicias (Delight Square), known by most locals as Plaza de Ponce. Most of what you want to see is within a few minutes’ walk of this plaza, and cafés and restaurants for refreshments are also near at hand. You can spend a wonderful morning just soaking in the atmosphere. The park, with its shady trees, cooling fountains, and somber bronze statues, including one of Luis Muñoz Marín, is where people come to take a break from the midday heat. There’s also a good ice-cream shop on the east side of the square.<n>At the heart of the square is the Cathedral of our Lady of Guadalupe, the city’s main place of worship since the late 1600s. Steady streams of visitors step inside to light a candle. Behind the cathedral is perhaps the most famous building in the city, the Parque de Bombas. This small museum to the city’s firefighters looks as though it were designed by a child and colored with crayons. Ornate wooden domes sitting atop four turrets that are painted in the brightest red and black stripes and highlighted with brilliant yellow. The structure was erected for a trade fair in 1882 and taken over by the bomba or firemen’s organization. The displays detail the bravery of individuals who fought fires in the once mostly wooden old town.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Heading west beyond La Parguera, you’ll need to use secondary roads, but these are in surprisingly good condition and relatively quiet. It’s almost a pampas landscape here, with grassy slopes and horses galore. Boquerón, a small village on the west coast, has arguably the most beautiful balneario (public beach) on Puerto Rico, a long arc of fine sand backed by sea grapes and palm trees. The settlement is growing due to its popularity, and a new marina is taking shape, but it still retains the feel of its origins as a fishing village. When the catches arrive, small temporary stalls are set up around the tiny town square. You can buy fresh clams and oysters, which can be shucked for you to eat as you go. There are a few small hotels here, which soon fill up on weekends and holidays, but if you arrive midweek or out of season, you may find that you are the only visitors.<n>South of Boquerón you leave the world behind. Make your way along Route 301 towards Cabo Rojo and the lighthouse at the southwest tip of the island to really enjoy natural Puerto Rico. Fishing is the main way people make a living here — between mangrove outcrops are many small shacks with boats tied up to rickety wooden jetties. The salt flats that you see are still harvested commercially. Eventually, the tarmac stops and the road changes to a simple dirt track. The surface is reasonable, so don’t worry about continuing on. You’ll travel over a narrow bridge and enter a section of the Bosque Estatal de Boquerón. Leave you car below the lighthouse and walk up the hill to reach it (a five-minute walk for the reasonably fit). Turn around as you climb the hill, and a wonderful sandy bay will open out in front of you. Pelicans play and feed, and frigate birds wheel in the sky above.<n>The Faro de Cabo Rojo (Cabo Rojo Lighthouse) has been sadly neglected, but the light still plays an important part in protecting shipping off the island. It sits atop some of the highest cliffs on Puerto Rico, a truly spectacular sight. But beware of going too close to the edge, as there are no fences here.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Warehouses built along the harbor by 17th- and 18th-century Danish merchants still play host to hundreds of traders. But now, instead of stocking such staples as cotton, flour, or salt, the stores are filled with the modern version of “pirate booty” — gold, gems, watches, and designer goods. The main shopping streets lie close to the waterfront. A series of narrow alleys are filled with craft, clothing, and jewelry shops, along with cafés and restaurants that provide welcome relief once you’ve become “shopped out.”<n>But Charlotte Amalie is not just a shopper’s paradise. There are historic gems to be discovered here as well. Perhaps the most prominent is Fort Christian, which sits to the east of downtown. Work on the fort began in 1671, to protect the harbor. The terra-cotta walls, pretty painted shutters, and crenellated clock tower give the building a cozy rather than a fearsome look. The interior has been transformed into a museum of life in the US Virgin Islands: colonial furniture, archive documents, and old photographs of the islands, people, and towns. Take a walk onto the walls of the fort for a wonderful view over the seafront and the colorful Vendors Plaza, a craft market under bright parasols that has a permanent home in the fort’s shadow.<n>Next to the fort is the pretty Legislature building with a classical façade painted bright lime green. Finished in 1874, the building was originally used as a barracks for troops based at the fort. Behind the fort and the Vendors Plaza is Emancipation Park, perhaps the one place in town where you can sit in the shade of the trees and enjoy the cooling sea breeze after your sightseeing and shopping. The park was named to commemorate the freeing of the slaves in 1848. Across Tolbod Gade is the Tourist Information Office, where you can pick up maps and other information. On the northern corner of Tolbod Gade is the main post office. Make your way in that direction, but don’t be tempted to turn right and head for the stores just yet. Take the steps to Kongens Gade, which is the street behind the Lutheran Church. The steps climb onto the steep hill that has many of the oldest and most important buildings of Danish Charlotte Amalie. The family houses of the merchants and civil servants where built high on this rise — named Government Hill — to take advantage of the cooling breeze. Kongens Gade itself has several buildings dating back to the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Hotel 1829, named for the year in which it was built, sits amid other fine homes. Walk past Hotel 1829 and pause at the steps beside it, which climb higher onto Government Hill. These are the 99 Steps, one of a series built by the Danes in the mid 1700s to allow pedestrian access to the town below. The 99 Steps are the longest in town, but whoever named the flight must have become tired toward the end and miscounted — there are in fact 103.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Perhaps one of the most beautiful and unusual buildings in Charlotte Amalie is the St. Thomas Synagogue, on Crystal Gade. This is the oldest synagogue building in continual use under the American flag. The Jewish congregation has always been strong here, from the very earliest days of Danish settlement in 1655. When the all-consuming fire of 1831 broke out, 64 families were worshipping in the small synagogue. Only one scroll could be saved before the flames destroyed the building. The present structure was built on the same spot and opened in 1833. The synagogue has sand on the floor, symbolic of the Jewish flight from Egypt.<n>The cruise port is situated at the West Indian Company Dock, a mile or so east of town. The thirty-minute walk around the harbor is pleasant if the traffic is not too busy. Those who want to ride will find numerous taxis waiting to take them to and from Charlotte Amalie. The dock is one of the largest, and busiest, in the Caribbean. Old Danish warehouses along the dockside have been transformed in recent years, creating Havensight Shopping Mall. Over 80 tax-free boutiques with cafés and restaurants sit only feet away from the huge ships. You will also find the ticket office for Atlantis Submarine in the Havensight Mall. This mini-submarine, which seats around thirty, takes you some 60 ft (18 m) under the sea to view coral reefs and the marine life that inhabits them. A ferry takes you out to Buck Island some 3 miles (5 km) offshore to rendezvous with the sub, which then submerges to spend about an hour exploring the reef around the island. Shoals of yellow-tailed snapper surround the machine, along with sharks, rays, and turtles. It is great fun for young and old alike and a safe way to see the underwater world.<n>Beside the cruise port is Flag Hill, rising 700 ft (214 m) above sea level. From here you can enjoy the panoramic views over Charlotte Amalie, the surrounding hills, and the harbor. Paradise Point Tramway has been built to carry passengers to a platform, which is ideal for photographers. The seven-minute journey to the top gives a clear view of Havensight and the cruise port and there are is a café/bar in case you want to stop for refreshment.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
