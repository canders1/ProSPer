We would sit around the fireplace, my cousin Matt and my cousin Jamie and Jeremy, and he would tell me these stories about, you know, this boyfriend and girlfriend. [SEP] I remember this one where one day they were, um, they were	driving	down the road, and actually I think this one might be a generic tale, but, uh, um they went to a gas station or something, and the guy gets out of the car to pump gas and the girl's been sitting in there but it's been a while. [SEP] So she looks around for him in the parking lot and she doesn't see him and she's worried, you know?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ManserAlexis.txt	drive	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

Um, and so that's been a, I think a good change for us, uh, since I work in that environment. [SEP] One thing, is it's been difficult trying to, now, now that my family starting to move down here, I think that the one drawback was, uh, just moving probably eight hours away,	driving	time, from um, from Dayton. [SEP] But now most of our family is in other places and so that's probably not as much of a factor.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt	drive	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

And, um, I was really small and that's why I must have only been like six or seven because I couldn't do anything else. [SEP] Um, I couldn't, um, help like bail the hay, pick up the hay, do anything because I was so small, so my mom and my dad and my older sister could, um, help collect the hay so my job became	driving	the truck and I could reach the pedals. [SEP] I was tall enough to reach the pedals but my dad taught me how and I would get in that truck and drive around from point to point while they picked up the hay and put it in the truck and I'd drive the truck around and wherever it needed to go and they'd store the hay.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt	drive	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
So yeah, I learned how to drive at a very early age and needless to say my first car was a straight drive and no one, um, in that town really waited until they were 15 or 16 to drive. [SEP] We all were	driving	pretty early because who's going to know about that far out that we didn't have a license so here's related, um, to	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt	drive	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
I was out there and my dad said I could drive the tractor while we were waiting on dinner. [SEP] So I was	driving	the tractor around, around, and around, and then I got called in for dinner, so I parked the tractor. [SEP] Oh, our house also sat on a hill and, I think it sat on the top of a hill, and then the field and the fencing went down, and then across the street was my uncle's land and no one lived there.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt	drive	spoken	OANC_spoken	2

okay  well i maybe i should qualify mine and and mention of course there are some legal parameters that need to be observed as well and uh in the case of	driving	it's not a it it's a privilege to drive and there's certain things that go along with it but even then they don't force you to take any kind of test if you simply don't take the test then you just you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw4307-ms98-a-trans.txt	drive	spoken	OANC_spoken	2
