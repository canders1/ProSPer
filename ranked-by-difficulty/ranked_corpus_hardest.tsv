Entertainment Once the sun goes down, Cancún gears up. There’s no shortage of places to go or things to do, and no need to take a long novel to fill those quiet moments — there just won’t be any. Many people don’t take to their beds until they’ve seen the sun	come	up. If you choose to stay in Mujeres or Cozumel, things will be a bit more laid back. The diving fraternity tends to enjoy low-key, less glamorous entertainment and relatively early nights before they head under the waves early the following day. Before you head straight into the resort atmosphere of Cancún, check out what’s happening in your hotel. Many have “Las Vegas style” floor shows, Mexican evenings with traditional folk music and dances, and clubs where you can take to the dance floor yourself.	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhatToDo.txt	1	6	0.21743647388119827	gpt2_base_gpt2_large_gpt2_med_gpt2_xl_gpt_txl

The origin of this custom is not known, but some believe it is to remind society that the stranger at the door should not be forgotten. Lorin Brown reports that in northern New Mexico the children went out on Christmas Eve, but in Canutillo, Texas, around the 1920s, it was the custom for children to go door to door on Christmas Day, although they didn’t recite the above chant. The neighbors expected them and were ready with gifts of fruits and candies. Lottie C. Devine makes reference to the Papago Indians in Arizona, saying that on “Christmas Day most of them	came	to town, all dressed in party clothes, and went from house to house ‘calling Christmas.’ Everyone gave them candies and apples and many of them in turn gave baskets or pottery” (29). Cabeza de Baca refers to this custom as aguinaldos, and the chant she records is similar to the one above, except that the last line is “A pedir Aguinaldos y Oremos.” Aguinaldos are gifts given during the Christmas season.

It made a huge impression on me and was a big thing. Columbus, GA is the home of Fort Benning, GA, where the largest infantry school in the world at that time was there, and as a kid walking to school, and believe it or not, I did walk four or five miles to school and I would go up Brown Avenue, which was at that time the only road that would allow the convoys to	come	through.

eijing Dongwu Yuan) is the creation of Empress Dowager Cixi, who in 1908 converted this private Ming Dynasty garden estate into a preserve for some 700 exotic animals imported from Germany. The entrance gate dates from the late Qing Dynasty, and many of the exhibition halls seem nearly as old. Even the outdoor pens seem quite dated. With some 6,000 animals the zoo is the largest in China, but despite its notable collection of giant pandas, Siberian tigers, golden monkeys, and red-crowned cranes, the facility is in need of modernization. Few foreign visitors are happy with the size and condition of the cages, although the new Panda Garden, featuring a half-dozen adult pandas and twin babies, is a bit more spacious and a step in the right direction.

The gate itself, designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, was built between 1789 and 1791. With two rows of six Doric columns forming the gateway proper, it was inspired by the Propylaeum gatehouse leading to the Parthenon in Athens. (To go all the way, Hitler had even planned to hoist the gate onto an artificial hill, in an attempt to create a mini-Acropolis.) Forming part of the city wall, the gate was intended by the more pragmatic Prussians not so much as a triumphal arch as an imposing tollgate for collecting duties. The gate was left isolated in no-man’s land when the Wall	went	up, and subsequently became the scene of quite ecstatic celebrations when it came down, though now you would scarcely believe it as Berliners cross nonchalantly from east to west through Brandenburg’s mighty central arch. The new US Embassy is being built nearby, on land originally occupied by that country’s pre-war embassy, and a large stretch of ground leading towards Potsdamer Platz has been designated as the site of a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	3	4	0.17514380888650966	gpt2_large_gpt2_med_gpt2_xl_txl

know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. But take Russia, for example. We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. They're going to have to make the decision themselves. Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make. So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is	coming	from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, we do it this way, so should you.

Price records are being set at auctions this week. At Christie's, a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz's "Equivalents" series sold for $396,000, a single-lot record. Other works also have been exceeding price estimates. In part, prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints. This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal, says Beth Gates-Warren of Sotheby's. "There is finally some sort of sense in the market," she says. Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers, giving greater market stability, says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector. "When I see prints going into the hands of institutions, I know they aren't going to	come	back on the market." Most in demand: classic photographs by masters such as Stieglitz and Man Ray. But much contemporary work is also fetching "a great deal of money," says Miles Barth of the International Center of Photography.

a codefined cluster of concepts that carve up the world in some new way. Consider, he said, legal language, and try translating it to ordinary statements about human agents without using legal concepts. So consider, “The jury found Henderson guilty of murder.” We understand this statement but do so in the context of law, evidence, legal responsibility, trials, guilt and innocence, jury systems, bribing jury members, appeal processes, and so forth. Now try to translate the statement into a set of statements about ordinary human actions, “A group of twelve people were seated behind a wooden enclosure for several days. People talked about someone having died of poison. One day, the twelve people left the room and went to another room and talked about what had happened. Then the twelve people	came	back and one man stood up and uttered the words, ‘We find Henderson guilty of murder.’” There is no finitely prespecifiable list of statements about ordinary human actions whose truth would be necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement that the jury found Henderson guilty of murder.	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	3	3	0.10310370719602946	gpt2_base_gpt2_large_gpt2_med

Robe’s collection of New Mexico legends contains thirty-four variants of the devil-at-the-dance tale. [SEP] Although the legends in this collection are from rural northern New Mexico, collected in the 1950s and 1960s, we find contemporary versions of the devil-at-the-dance tales in south Texas and in Baja California from the 1980s. [SEP] Limón and Herrera-Sobek discuss versions of the tale circulating in nightclubs and discotheques among urbanized young people. [SEP] Of course, not everyone believes such stories. [SEP] Martin’s book contains a story by a man born in 1904, who says his friend played a trick on his community in Tucson by	coming	to a dance dressed in black, with a fake rooster foot. [SEP] Eventually someone noticed his foot and yelled, “The Devil! The Devil!” [SEP] The narrator says he was there when his friend played the trick, so he doesn’t believe in the legend (50).

rsistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera. But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. With the horse went the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. With the car	came	paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. Most firms die young, some last a long time. We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions. The parallels are at least tantalizing, and probably more than that.

At this point, we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional. “The only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours. Love-ins, raves, gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion: that is where entities from this world tend to	go	when they cross over, and that is where Rachel met someone from this world. Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this, where the human population is so overwhelming that they won’t be noticed in the right corner, with the right protective spells.” He took out the hunchback’s directions and glanced at an alley behind us. “Okay, Nathan. We should get started right away. There’s no time to waste.”	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	masc_written	written	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	1	2	0.07848787243975175	gpt2_base_gpt

The main attraction is the 26-km- (16-mile-) long sandy shores of Jandía that run from the narrowest part of Fuerteventura down to Morro Jable. At the northern tip of the Jandía sands are the beautiful beaches of Costa Calma, not blighted as yet by over-development. Here, a low cliff backing and a scattering of rocks and coves give the beach far more character than some of the seemingly endless stretches farther south. The Playa de Sotavento is world-famous as a windsurfing center, with activity focused on the F2 school at the Sol Elite Gorriones Hotel. This has one of the best, and most isolated beach locations in all of the islands. Here the beach is very wide and flat, usually empty and, as the tides	go	out, also very wet. The dunes behind and a little farther to the south form an idyllic beach backdrop. Urbanizaciones spread relentlessly all the way down the coast to Morro Jable, which has some similarities with its northern sister Corralejo; both are ports and resorts, but in most other aspects are quite dissimilar. Whereas Corralejo is flat, rather dingy, without many hotels and restaurants of much class, and doesn’t have much of its own beach, Morro Jable, built along the cliffs, is bright and airy, boasts numerous fine hotels and restaurants, and has miles of wonderful beaches. It is interesting to note that while Corralejo is a mainly British resort Morro Jable, on the other hand, is frequented predominantly by Germans. There are more fine beaches towards the southern tip of the isla	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt	1	2	0.16613750395293825	gpt2_large_gpt

Yardas (Gardens) Although the Spanish word for garden is jardín, many Chicano families favor the term “yard” while referring to their gardens, pronouncing it in Spanish as yarda. Although yarda appears to be a pochismo (Chicano slang), it can be found in Cassell’s Spanish Dictionary. The layout and organizational aesthetics of Chicano yardas are unique enough that folklorists and cultural geographers have written about them. Many yardas can aesthetically constitute yard art, even though it does not appear that this is the intent of the creator. Besides planting shrubs, flowers, and sometimes grass, the gardener will bring into play the creativity that	goes	into decorating a yard unconsciously, with the result being a folk art display. Invariably, a yard will contain many potted flowers arranged in a patterned manner. The central focus of many yards is often a devotional shrine set up in memory of a family member, with a nicho housing a saint or Madonna, and the design of the yard’s plants and flowers is laid out in reference to the shrine. Some yardas may not have planted grass, but instead hard-packed dirt that is kept free of weeds, swept frequently, and kept prepared for family gatherings. But trees, preferably fruit trees, abound to make shade for family gatherings and outdoor cooking.

Mealtimes and similar occasions for family togetherness open special conversational doors. Because all family members are present, dinner talk can convey to children a sense of family coherence and identity.101 Most of us can still recapture the stories our parents told us, in which social and moral lessons were powerful and abundant. Here is one my mother told me, recalled in vivid detail nearly a half century later: “Once, when your grandfather was 16 years old, he	came	home weeping, his hands all bloody from working in the factory. His mother, your great grandmother, wiped away his tears and said, ‘Don’t cry, one day you’ll own that factory.’ And by the time he was 30, he did.” Dinnertime recaps of daily events also permit today’s children, isolated from the adult world of real work, to gain access to their parents’ daily lives.

You can see penned reptiles at the crocodile farm at La Boca, a popular tourist site where you can pose with a baby croc and taste crocodile steak. A more appealing prospect is picturesque Guamá, a half-hour boat ride from La Boca along an artificial channel and then across the vast Laguna del Tesoro (Treasure Lake). Legend has it that the Indians dumped their jewels into the water rather than surrender them to Spanish conquistadores. Guamá is a group of tiny islands connected by wooden bridges. A few visitors stay in the thatched cabañas (see page 131), but most just	come	to wander along the boardwalk, greet the ducks and egrets, and have a meal. The peninsula is best known, however, for its bloody role in clandestine political warfare.

The Central Area There are several approaches to Las Cañadas National Park and Mount Teide. The park is well sign-posted from the road via La Orotava, but if you are	coming	from the north, then the most picturesque route is via La Esperanza. The small town soon gives way to a lush forest of giant pines and eucalyptus trees. Four km (21⁄2 miles) south at Las Raíces is where Franco met with his co-conspirators in 1936 (see page 20). An obelisk in the forest commemorates the event. As the road gains altitude and temperatures fall, the views become ever more spectacular. The Mirador Pico de las Flores looks out over to the southeast and the Mirador de Ortuño offers a panorama of the northern coast. Highest of all at over 2,000 m (6,562 ft), Mirador las Cumbres reveals Teide in all her glory. The entrance to the National Park is El Portillo de las Cañadas, where there is a visitor center (open daily 9am–4pm).

I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me. I raised the stake; he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine.

Nationhood and Citizenship As much as Lincoln sought to evoke a consciousness of American nationhood, this idea did not readily resonate in the minds of lawyers. [SEP] The word “nation” was not used in the postbellum amendments. [SEP] I doubt if it even occurred to counsel for the butchers to	come	into court and argue that independent tradesmen had a right, granted to them by the American nation, to practice their trade without the duty to pay tolls and use specific facilities. [SEP] Their rights derived, if from anyplace, from universal principles governing the free market and dignity of working people. [SEP] Yet, this very argument—that the nation was the source of rights acquired under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments—would show itself, remarkably, in a majestic dissenting opinion in 1883.17 The idea of the American nation may have been in the air in the 1870s, but it was not part of the stock of concepts that the Court would draw on directly to domesticate its abstract sense of justice. [SEP] The concept of an American nation was part of the American creed, but it had yet	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	1	1	0.6815077802953691	bert_base

ence of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to come to the United States. [SEP] Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos, with the same prejudicial meaning as “greaser” or “spic.” [SEP] Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants. [SEP] Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called “wets.” [SEP] Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels. [SEP] In Mexico, the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas, a literal translation for the word wetback. [SEP] In 1955 a well--established Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas, which intended to persuade Mexicans not to	go	to the United States. [SEP] It was a political film that incorporated all of the standard characters that would appear in countless other films and novels of the Chicano experience: the wetback, the pocho (half Mexican), the coyote (smuggler) who smuggles people into the United States, and the grower Mister Sterling. [SEP] An ironic, yet justified ending shows Mister Sterling dumped into the Rio Grande by Mexicans, and as he swims to the U.S. side of the border he is shot by the Border Patrol. [SEP] In a 1998 article Herrera-Sobek discusses the use of corridos in several Mexican films that depict the plight of the illegal immigrant, or el mojado.

Mojado (Wetback) A translation of the word “wetback,” sometimes spelled moja’o, which literally simply means “wet.” [SEP] It is a pejorative expression, although it is sometimes used by Mexican people to describe themselves and their experience of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to	come	to the United States. [SEP] Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos, with the same prejudicial meaning as “greaser” or “spic.” [SEP] Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants. [SEP] Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called “wets.” [SEP] Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels. [SEP] In Mexico, the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas, a literal translation for the word wetback.

The Golden Age With the triumph of Christianity, the country was united under the Catholic Monarchs (Los Reyes Católicos), a title conferred by Pope Alexander VI on Ferdinand II of Aragón and Isabella I of Castile. [SEP] Also in 1492, Cristobal Colón (Christopher Columbus) discovered the New World in the name of the Spanish crown. [SEP] Fanatical in their religious zeal, the king and queen expelled all Jews who refused to convert to Christianity in the same year, and the Moors followed in 1502. [SEP] The rulers thus reneged on the promise of religious freedom they had given when Granada surrendered. [SEP] With the Jews who left Spain	went	many of the country’s bankers and merchants, and with the Moors, a good number of its agriculturists and laborers. [SEP] The converted Jews (conversos) and Moors (Moriscos) who remained in Spain were viewed with suspicion by the Inquisition, which had been established by the Catholic Monarchs to stamp out heresy. [SEP] Many were condemned to death, and still more fled the country to escape persecution. [SEP] The 16th century was glorious for Spain, with the conquest of the New World bringing much prestige and wealth. [SEP] In 1503, the Casa de Contratación in Sevilla was awarded a monopoly on trade with Spain’s territories in the Americas.

inction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. [SEP] In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. [SEP] We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. [SEP] We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. [SEP] And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera. [SEP] But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. [SEP] Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. [SEP] With the horse	went	the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. [SEP] With the car came paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. [SEP] The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. [SEP] One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. [SEP] More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? [SEP] Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. [SEP] Most firms die young, some last a long time. [SEP] We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions.

y of Hanuman Dhoka Palace. [SEP] The palace, which now serves primarily as a museum, takes its name from the red-cloaked figure of the monkey god Hanuman that stands to the left of the main palace entrance. [SEP] This stone statue was erected in 1672 and stands atop a squat pillar. [SEP] The statue’s face is entirely obscured by red paste that is smeared on by worshippers. [SEP] Tour guides say the red paste is to spare Hanuman the sight of the goings-on — more acrobatic than erotic — carved on the struts of the small Jaganath Temple opposite. [SEP] When this bit of mythology is related, it immediately sends tour groups trotting across to see what is forbidden to the monkey god. [SEP] Some say the carvings are there for protection, because the goddess of lightning is a virgin who would not	come	near anything so shocking. [SEP] The erotica is probably best explained, however, along with Nepal’s ubiquitous Shiva lingams (phalluses) and the female yoni symbols, as an expression of the creative energy in male-female relations and the pleasure principles of Tantrism. [SEP] In the palace wall beyond the Hanuman statue and protected by a wooden fence is a poem etched in stone in 15 languages dated 14 January 1664. [SEP] It is attributed to King Pratap Malla, reputed to be a great linguist.	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	1	1	0.6108600873781752	bert_large

nts.13 [SEP] The key provisions of these amendments define political membership, articulate basic rights, and provide an ambit of legislative competence. [SEP] So reformed, the American system of government would be able to protect individual rights as well as promote the equality of all persons who survived the war. [SEP] Of course, we must assume a set of institutions—a Congress, an Executive, and a Judiciary—that will continue to function according to the terms of their initial creation. [SEP] Still, there is something missing in this filtering off of the three Reconstruction Amendments and calling them a separate constitution. [SEP] The missing factor is the consciousness of setting forth a new framework of government, a structure based on values fundamentally different from those that	went	before. [SEP] To find that consciousness, we need to turn, I wish to argue, to the critical message of the Civil War, the address that would generate a new normative world in which to make sense of the epic war that consumed America from the firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox. [SEP] The new Nomos, the new framework of values that necessitated a new constitution, comes forth in one of the great prayers of the American civil religion, the Gettysburg Address. [SEP] It is worth recalling some of the enduring phrases of this civil prayer, the incantations that reverberated in American consciousness: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation [SEP] . . . .	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt	3	1	0.51077536753863	bert_large

eir primary reason for not doing so was to save money, not to piss off the victims of Colubmine. [SEP] That does not change the fact that they did just that. [SEP] Moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff. [SEP] This is what good documentary filmmaking is about. [SEP] And here the critics again ignore important evidence: When Heston mentions the mayor of Denver, the crowd boos loudly. [SEP] Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayor's letter (only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request -- not mentioning at all the reasons you have given!). This booing by the crowd, not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article, shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by	coming	to Littleton after children were being killed there -- and they effectively said "Fuck you". [SEP] To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moore's critics. [SEP] 4) The Kayla Rolland case. [SEP] Again, critics like yourself charge Moore with deception.

The Spanish conducted the first Catholic mass in Mexico here after their arrival in 1518, but they had little interest in the island. [SEP] It remained almost uninhabited through the 18th century. [SEP] But following the War of the Castes in 1847–1848, several rebel families settled here to escape retribution by colonial landowners on the Yucatecan mainland. [SEP] They eked out a simple living for decades until the invention of the scuba tank. [SEP] And the rest, as they say, is history! [SEP] Cozumel has multiple personalities; it caters to divers who	go	to bed early and rise with the sun, yet it also has occasionally raucous nightlife for those who want to stay out and party. [SEP] Those who know the island well refer to this phenomenon as the “wet” side and the “dry” side. [SEP] Day-trippers who arrive on their huge floating cruise ships — or on daily ferries from Playa del Carmen — add an extra dimension; they want to see everything in a few hours, so the slow routine of island life speeds up when they arrive. [SEP] There is only one settlement, the capital, on Cozumel, San Miguel de Cozumel; it’s a bustling town chock-full of souvenir shops, duty-free emporiums, bars, and assorted cafés and restaurants. [SEP] If you arrive on the island by ferry from the mainland, you’ll be dropped off directly opposite the heart of the downtown area, P	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt	1	1	0.31949587751081654	distilbert

role played by guns. I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands. Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law. Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun	comes	from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun. What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence. So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws. We added beds. We're tough. We believe in tough love. We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained. And that's what needs to happen. We've got laws. If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important. New question. As I was saying. Both of you -- Governor, both of you have talked much about Medicare and health care for seniors. What about the more than 40 million younger Americans who do not have health insurance right now?

ed critical biosphere with a power law distribution of small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events. As we shall see, the best data now suggest that precisely such a power law distribution of extinction and speciation events has occurred over the past 650 million years of the Phanerozoic. In addition, the same body of theory predicts that most species go extinct soon after their formation, while some live a long time. The predicted species lifetime distribution is a power law. So too are the data. Similar phenomena may occur in an econosphere. Small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events occur in our technologies. A colleague, Brian Arthur, is fond of pointing out that when the car came in, the horse, buggy, buggy whip, saddlery, smithy, and Pony Express	went	out of business. The car paved the way for an oil and gas industry, paved roads, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote about this kind of turbulence in capitalist economies. These Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction appear to occur in small and large avalanches. Perhaps the avalanches arise in power laws. And, like species, most firms die young; some make it to old age = Storre, in Sweden, is over nine hundred years old. The distribution of firm lifetimes is again a power law. Here are hints = common law, ecosystems, economic systems = that general principles govern the coevolutionary coconstruction of lives and livings, organisms and natural games, firms and economic opportunities. Perhaps such a law governs any biosphere anywhe	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt	3	1	0.05953312509041142	gpt2_base

I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes. She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd. When she hadn’t	come	back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn’t see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn’t see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin. The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. He didn’t move, just stared and held his drink.

Not far from the museum is one of Santiago’s best places to get sweaty in the evening. The Casa de las Tradiciones, a “cultural center” in a sweet little pink house (Calle General Lacret, 651), has live music and as much dancing as its tiny space will allow. It’s great fun, and the locals usually outnumber the tourists. Just west of the Padre Pico steps (south of the train station) is the one-room César Escalante cigar factory, unimpressive by comparison with other Cuban cigar factories but still an enjoyable place to visit, and the Ron Caney rum factory. The oldest rum distillery in the country, it was established in 1838 by Don Facundo Bacardí (whose descendants fled the country in 1959) and nationalized the following year. The rum produced here now	goes	under the name “Havana Club.” You can visit only a small museum and bar.

keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability. And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military. It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious. I don't disagree with that. I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete. That's what we did in Haiti. There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now. And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy. That's really about all we can do. But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to	come	across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there. And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose. And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended. I certainly agree with that. And that's why I've supported building up our capacity. I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed. I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does. We've had some disagreements about that. He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say. But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.

usually dinner—are special social contexts for families in complex societies. They are among the few occasions in which parents and children regularly gather after spending most of the day apart and in which the main family activity is relating to one another. Hence, mealtime talk overﬂows with opportunities for socialization. Mealtimes and similar occasions for family togetherness open special conversational doors. Because all family members are present, dinner talk can convey to children a sense of family coherence and identity.101 Most of us can still recapture the stories our parents told us, in which social and moral lessons were powerful and abundant. Here is one my mother told me, recalled in vivid detail nearly a half century later: “Once, when your grandfather was 16 years old, he	came	home weeping, his hands all bloody from working in the factory. His mother, your great grandmother, wiped away his tears and said, ‘Don’t cry, one day you’ll own that factory.’ And by the time he was 30, he did.” Dinnertime recaps of daily events also permit today’s children, isolated from the adult world of real work, to gain access to their parents’ daily lives.

Sweeping eastwards from the gate, this grand 61-m (200-ft) -wide avenue, literally named “Beneath the Linden Trees,” was Berlin’s showcase boulevard. Frederick the Great saw it as the center of his royal capital, and it became the most prestigious address in town. Some of its splendor fell victim to 19th-century building speculation, but the avenue remained fashionable until the bombs of World War II reduced it to rubble. Now the trees have been replanted and the most important buildings restored. Its western end is dominated by the Russian Federation Embassy on the right as you	come	from Brandenburg Gate. Close by is the smartest hotel in town; the supremely elegant Hotel Adlon was recently built on the site of the original hotel of the same name, which was a 1930s Berlin legend. Continuing east, you pass the unprepossessing modern façade of the Komische Oper, one of Berlin’s most important opera companies. The ugly exterior is the result of post-war reconstruction; happily, the magnificently over-the-top original gilded interior has been retained.	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	1	1	0.07493802843765818	gpt

This be	came	patently clear during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, in which the inadequacy of the Chinese army was starkly displayed. Japan and Western powers were dismantling the Chinese Empire. Demands for reform won the support of the emperor, but his notoriously scheming aunt, the Empress Dowager Cixi (Tz’u Hsi), edged him off the throne. Soon after, Cixi had the chance to exploit the Boxer Rebellion (1900), a revolt against foreign influence. It was finally put down by the intervention of all the great powers, which joined together in an unprecedented alliance. China was saddled with payment of a humiliating indemnity and a further loss of respect.<n>The elderly empress died in 1908, one day after the mysterious death of her nephew, the unseated emperor.

Iráklion<n>Iráklion	comes	as a surprise to travelers used to Greek islands further north in the Aegean Sea. It is a true city bustling with activity, dust, and noise. The commercial and administrative heart of Crete, its streets are filled with bankers and business people. There is a lively young scene based around the university, and a sophistication to match other major Greek cities such as Athens or Thessalonica. However, this is not the only facet of the city. Around the harbor you’ll still find a fishing industry based on small family-owned boats, and small workshops in the narrow back streets that still manufacture by hand. Though there are many modern buildings, these sit shoulder to shoulder with fine old mansions and are evidence of an older Iráklion, which is fascinating to explore.

Changsha<n>If you	go	to Changsha by train, you will arrive at the second biggest railway station in China, a distinction quite out of proportion to the amount of rail traffic or the size of the city.

Now that the cult of Mao has faded in glory, the stations and the shrines are uncrowded and Changsha has returned to its age-old role as a rather prosaic regional center of trade and culture. However, the surrounding fertile countryside is attractive, the spicy Hunan cuisine is worth trying, the scenic mountain areas of the province are outstanding, and the archaeological displays are stunning.<n>The capital of Hunan Province, Changsha lies along the Xiang River, a w	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	1	1	0.0006817516507579742	recurrent_wiki

xistence of new goods and services and extinction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera. But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. With the horse	went	the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. With the car came paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. Most firms die young, some last a long time. We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions. The parallels are at least tantalizing, and 	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt	3	1	0.9226225837910872	roberta

of the Reconstruction Amendments.13 The key provisions of these amendments define political membership, articulate basic rights, and provide an ambit of legislative competence. So reformed, the American system of government would be able to protect individual rights as well as promote the equality of all persons who survived the war. Of course, we must assume a set of institutions—a Congress, an Executive, and a Judiciary—that will continue to function according to the terms of their initial creation. Still, there is something missing in this filtering off of the three Reconstruction Amendments and calling them a separate constitution. The missing factor is the consciousness of setting forth a new framework of government, a structure based on values fundamentally different from those that	went	before. To find that consciousness, we need to turn, I wish to argue, to the critical message of the Civil War, the address that would generate a new normative world in which to make sense of the epic war that consumed America from the firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox. The new Nomos, the new framework of values that necessitated a new constitution, comes forth in one of the great prayers of the American civil religion, the Gettysburg Address. It is worth recalling some of the enduring phrases of this civil prayer, the incantations that reverberated in American consciousness: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation. . . .	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt	3	1	0.8090344099373664	roberta

at minimal cost, they gathered in ever-increasing numbers. Tales were told in Australia about the “perfect wave,” and Kuta became the dream destination for every surfer. Once a poor fishing village and wasteland believed to be inhabited by bad spirits, by the 1980s it was transformed into a frenetic scene, fueled by plenty of alcohol and, for a while, illegal drugs. The height limit was virtually the only regulation applied to building, and a sprawling shantytown soon sprang up. Theft and prostitution (chiefly blamed on incomers from the other islands) looked as if they were becoming endemic. On and off the beach, every foreigner was plagued by hawkers as adhesive as bush flies. Eventually, voices were heard at banjar meetings urging a clean-up and the raising of standards. Today Kuta has	gone	a long way toward putting its house right. Drugs have largely disappeared and crime rates are down, although you still need to beware of pickpockets and shouldn’t leave property unguarded. Traffic, however, remains Kuta’s nightmare. Kuta, and its progressively upscale neighbors to the north — Legian, Seminyak, and Kerobokan (as well as Tuban, to the south) — provide an enormous selection of hotels, restaurants, pubs, and shopping choices. In all price ranges, you’ll find some of the best Italian, French, Vegetarian, Asian, and Mexican restaurants on the island, as well as some of the best shops for crafts from other islands, fashion, locally produced ikat cloth, and casual Bali-style beach clothing.

describe themselves and their experience of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to come to the United States. Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos, with the same prejudicial meaning as “greaser” or “spic.” Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants. Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called “wets.” Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels. In Mexico, the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas, a literal translation for the word wetback. In 1955 a well--established Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas, which intended to persuade Mexicans not to	go	to the United States. It was a political film that incorporated all of the standard characters that would appear in countless other films and novels of the Chicano experience: the wetback, the pocho (half Mexican), the coyote (smuggler) who smuggles people into the United States, and the grower Mister Sterling. An ironic, yet justified ending shows Mister Sterling dumped into the Rio Grande by Mexicans, and as he swims to the U.S. side of the border he is shot by the Border Patrol. In a 1998 article Herrera-Sobek discusses the use of corridos in several Mexican films that depict the plight of the illegal immigrant, or el mojado.

Members of the academic electronic listserv CHICLE have held discussions and reminisced about La Mano Negra. One member remembered it by the name of La Mano Pachona without knowing its origin, but the fear of it was well remembered by all. Marc Simmons writes about a legend of La Mano Negra from the town of Bernalillo, New Mexico. An old priest dies, but the villagers believe he was unable to complete all his work because his spirit frequently returns. When the bell of the church is heard ringing late at night, the local Indians come to listen, and they see the spirit of the priest	going	into the church and praying. They call the Hispanos to come and see, and when the priest is seen in the church one of the observers cries out. At this point the priest places his hand on the missal and vanishes. “Burned through several pages was the scorched imprint of the padre’s hand, La Mano Negro.” Simmons states that he recalls a similar legend from Ireland (2).

and small, in the immediate vicinity of Hanuman Dhoka Palace. The palace, which now serves primarily as a museum, takes its name from the red-cloaked figure of the monkey god Hanuman that stands to the left of the main palace entrance. This stone statue was erected in 1672 and stands atop a squat pillar. The statue’s face is entirely obscured by red paste that is smeared on by worshippers. Tour guides say the red paste is to spare Hanuman the sight of the goings-on — more acrobatic than erotic — carved on the struts of the small Jaganath Temple opposite. When this bit of mythology is related, it immediately sends tour groups trotting across to see what is forbidden to the monkey god. Some say the carvings are there for protection, because the goddess of lightning is a virgin who would not	come	near anything so shocking. The erotica is probably best explained, however, along with Nepal’s ubiquitous Shiva lingams (phalluses) and the female yoni symbols, as an expression of the creative energy in male-female relations and the pleasure principles of Tantrism. In the palace wall beyond the Hanuman statue and protected by a wooden fence is a poem etched in stone in 15 languages dated 14 January 1664. It is attributed to King Pratap Malla, reputed to be a great linguist.	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	1	1	0.5696253794412885	roberta

Robe’s collection of New Mexico legends contains thirty-four variants of the devil-at-the-dance tale. Although the legends in this collection are from rural northern New Mexico, collected in the 1950s and 1960s, we find contemporary versions of the devil-at-the-dance tales in south Texas and in Baja California from the 1980s. Limón and Herrera-Sobek discuss versions of the tale circulating in nightclubs and discotheques among urbanized young people. Of course, not everyone believes such stories. Martin’s book contains a story by a man born in 1904, who says his friend played a trick on his community in Tucson by	coming	to a dance dressed in black, with a fake rooster foot. Eventually someone noticed his foot and yelled, “The Devil! The Devil!” The narrator says he was there when his friend played the trick, so he doesn’t believe in the legend (50).

bundle system is used. Shirts are normally counted by the dozen, so a production lot comes to 125 dozen. Each day, the manager looks over the factory floor to see if any carts with a particular flag color are falling behind the others of that group. Delays in product flow can result from machine problems, worker absence, or if priority is given to special orders. In some plants, the carts may contain up to a day’s worth of work. Although this may appear to be a crude way of keeping track of the work flow, it is simple and generally effective. Still, work almost never progresses in perfect lockstep through a factory. Finding the correct parts for a shirt can often involve a hunt through the plant. For example, a worker might accidentally leave a bundle of unfinished work in the cart when it	goes	back to be loaded again. Because a worker may have a day’s work in the carts in front of her, it is easy to see how individual bundles of parts can be misplaced—which, in turn, will hold up the assembly of some SKUs. Partially finished shirts and shirt subassemblies will then be in a number of places in the factory. This shirt factory employs 250 workers. If the shirt in question is rated to require twelve minutes to assemble, such as the one in the figure, a forty-hour work week will produce 4,167 dozen shirts when the factory is operating at standard efficiency. (Of course, many plants may fall below the standard and take longer than twelve minutes to make that shirt.)10 A typical time for a shirt to go through the plant is four weeks, which means the plant will have 16,667 dozen shirts a	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt	4	1	0.4478549545989904	roberta

Mojado (Wetback) A translation of the word “wetback,” sometimes spelled moja’o, which literally simply means “wet.” It is a pejorative expression, although it is sometimes used by Mexican people to describe themselves and their experience of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to	come	to the United States. Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos, with the same prejudicial meaning as “greaser” or “spic.” Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants. Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called “wets.” Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels. In Mexico, the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas, a literal translation for the word wetback. In 1955 a well--established Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas, which intended to persuade Mexicans not to go to the United States.

The summit of Hollywood hype and glitter is attained in late March or early April, when the Oscars, or the Academy Awards, are handed out to the film industry’s brightest lights. The ceremony takes place at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and admission is by invitation only to members of the Motion Pictures Academy, nominees, and their guests.

The whole area is a place of staggering proportions: there are over 200 species of native trees. One specimen is said to be over 2,500 years old; some trees are so wide it takes several people to reach around them; others soar hundreds of feet into the air. The forest gets over 180 inches (41���2 m) of rain each year — that’s some 100 billion gallons (450 billion liters) of water. The animals that live here are also amazing. This is one of the last habitats of the threatened Puerto Rican parrot. The infamous coquí (see page 47)is, of course, heard everywhere. All in all, the park in an impressive sight, with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance. Arriving via Route 191 you’ll	come	right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park. This facility presents important information about the history of the park, its plant and animal species, and its role in the local ecology. You can then travel on higher into the park, toward the summit. You can’t drive the whole 8 miles (13 km) between the visitors center and the end of the road, but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way, so there’s ample access. Two popular stops are La Coca Falls, on the right after the 5-mile (8-km) point, and the Yokahú Observation Tower, at the 51⁄2-mile (9-km) point. Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes.

treet, the military highway that founder John Simcoe thrust north from the fort to Lake Simcoe, starts out now as downtown Toronto’s main commercial artery. Its intersection at the elegant shopping thoroughfare, Bloor Street, is the fashionable hub of the city. Following John Simcoe’s military grid pattern, Toronto’s main arteries run from the lakefront north: Spadina and University Avenues, Bay, Yonge, and Church Streets; and east–west: Front, King, Queen, Dundas, College-Carlton, and Bloor Streets. Our sightseeing itinerary starts down at the waterfront and works north through the business district to the chic shopping and museum area. As an alternative, especially if you have children, you may prefer to start downtown, around Union Station, and visit the other sights to the north before	coming	back to relax among the recreational attractions of the waterfront. Getting around the city is quite simple, but while downtown, park your car and walk or use the buses or subway.

high bridge from the Ming period called “Longevity Bridge.” Here and elsewhere, the rich, flat land produces the ingredients for a formidable fruit salad: oranges and grapefruit, chestnuts and persimmons, plus exotic tropical delicacies all but unknown outside Asia. Adding to the entrancing beauty of the scene, great stands of a feathery variety of bamboo grow along the riverbanks, forming huge cascades of green. Beyond the village of Yangdi unfolds the uncanny scenery that prompted a Chinese poet more than a thousand years ago to write: “The river is a green silk belt, the mountains emerald hairpins.” Peaks and pinnacles crowd the river, white goats pose on steep mountainsides, and an eagle soars above the cliffs. The river itself flows green and transparent. Credit for this limpid rarity	goes	not only to the strict antipollution standards to protect the River Li but also to nature itself, which endows the water with a high content of carbonic acid. Mural Hill is so called because the sheer cliff face comprises so many patches of color that it might be a fresco. In the lights and shadows of the cliff, the shapes of nine different horses can be discerned, hence the cliff’s alternate name, “Nine Horse Hill.” Near the end of the voyage, the village of Xinping comes into view on the left bank, surrounded by magical scenery — landmarks with names like Snail Hill, Five Fingers Hill, and Carp Hill.	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	4	1	0.09037333991842662	txl

Now create a large, square petri plate with rows and columns drawn on the plastic below to guide your experimental hands. Arrange the rows, numbered to to correspond to blue bacteria secreting to molecules a second. Arrange the columns, numbered to to correspond to the red bacteria secreting to molecules a second. Into each of the x cells on your square petri plate, place exactly one red and one blue bacterium with the corresponding secretion rates. Thus, in the upper left, bacteria that are low blue and low red secretors are coplated onto each square. On the lower left, high blue and low red secretors are coplated. On the upper right, low blue and high red secretors are coplated. And in the lower right corner, high red and high blue bacteria are coplated. Go for lunch, and dinner, and	come	back the next day. In general, among the , coplated pairs of bacteria, while all , colonies will have grown, a single pair will have grown to the largest mixed red-blue bacterial colony. Say the largest mixed red-blue colony corresponds to red secreting molecules per second, blue secreting molecules per second. This gedankenexperiment is important, for the exchange ratio of red and blue molecules is the analogue of price, the ratio of trading of oranges for apples. And there exists a ratio, red molecules to blue molecules per second, that maximizes the growth of the mixed red-blue bacterial colony. Since the fastest growing mixed red-blue colony will exponentially outgrow all others and dominate our gedankenexperiment petri plate, this red-blue pair establishes “price” in the system at red 	go	come	drive	walk	arrive	OANC_written	written	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt	1	1	0.053626519947174614	txl

you. Breakfast might be a bowl of porridge or toast and eggs. After a bit of a wash-up from a basin of warm water, you’ll be on the trail by 7am. No need to worry about packing up the tent or cleaning the breakfast dishes: that’s what you’ve hired the porters to do. Porters stop for their first real meal of the day — rice and lentils — between 10 and 11am, and consequently, trekkers can also expect to eat lunch fairly early, usually on the edge of a village or at a scenic vista. After a bit of exploration in the area, there will be a few more hours of hiking before calling it quits for the day around 3pm, once again usually in an interesting village. The porters will then busy themselves with setting up camp, usually in a designated campground, and preparing the evening meal. The sun often	goes	behind the mountains early, and supper always follows soon after sunset, usually around 6pm. With only kerosene lamps to keep away the dark, exhausted trekkers usually head for bed by 9pm. For trekkers doing a lodge-to-lodge trek, the day’s schedule is slightly different. There is usually no “bed tea,” but there might be a wide range of choices for breakfast (many lodges now have electric ovens, and fresh baked breads and rolls are all the rage).	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt	4	1	0.04170674257177252	txl

entertainment Spaniards have earned a reputation as consummate partiers, and while Barcelona may not be as fanatical about late nights as Madrid, it is still a place that really swings when the sun	goes	down. It has virtually every kind of nightlife diversion, from cool cabarets to live jazz, rock, flamenco, and world beat to opera, and a thriving bar and disco scene. At night, some streets, like the Rambla and Passeig de Gràcia, become slow-moving rivers of strollers. The main churches and monuments are illuminated, and the city takes on a new and graceful aspect. The weekly cultural guide Guía del Ocio contains up-to-date information on all entertainment in Barcelona (available at newsstands, in Spanish), while Barcelona Olé!, a monthly guide put out by Barcelona Tourism, has information on big shows and performances.	goes	comes	drives	walks	arrives	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt	4	1	0.03710528567691205	txl

Peace lasted for the rest of the century and the country made great economic strides as a province of the Habsburg empire. Factories, theatres, and newspapers were opened and Pest expanded its role in international trade while Buda regained its status as Hungary’s administrative centre. But prosperity was not for the majority. The rich were getting richer while the serfs were getting poorer, and the Magyar identity was being repressed by the influence of the Germanic Habsburgs. In the mid-19th century, the Hungarians once again	went	to war for their independence. The rebellion of 1848 was led by a group of young intellectuals, including the 25-year-old radical poet, Sándor Petoﬁ. A provisional government was formed, headed by Lajos Kossuth, but it was short-lived. The Emperor Franz Joseph I summoned help from the Czar of Russia and the revolt was crushed in 1849.	went	came	drove	walked	arrived	OANC_written	written	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-History.txt	3	1	0.033034603498507016	txl

A short walk across the park (just follow the crowds) is the stop for the Children’s Railway (Széchenyi-hegyi Gyermekvasút), thus named because it is operated almost entirely by school-children; only the engine drivers are adults. This is an old narrow-gauge line which traverses seemingly unspoiled forests — but for the numerous walking trails — and climbs, slowly, ever-upwards.
