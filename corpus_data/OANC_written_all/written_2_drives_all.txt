These centralized spreading and cutting facilities generally operate at least two shifts per day and, in some large companies, around the clock. The equipment is capital intensive, especially if computerized or die-cutting machinery is used; therefore, plant managers try to keep these lines producing as much as possible. We have visited a large knit goods manufacturer that combined final fabric finishing operations in the same building with cutting and initial automated sewing, all of which operated around the clock. Although automation of sewing operations is generally not cost effective, these innovations have made some inroads in particular segments. T-shirts, which are consumed in the United States every year by the billions, are a good example. A commercially available machine can automatically make the sleeves of T-shirts. This machine picks up cut material from a carousel at one end and delivers finished sleeves at the other. One operator can tend to the needs of two such machines. Yet because the investment per worker is several hundred thousand dollars, it only makes sense if the equipment is used nearly continuously.<n>Sewing factories, in contrast, are not capital intensive and are rarely operated for more than one shift. Because of this, most expensive automation equipment is concentrated in preassembly, drawing on multi-shift operations. Marker-making, fusing processes, sleeve-making for T-shirts, die-cutting, and computer-driven knife-cutting fall into this automated “getting ready to sew” category. As always in a world of lean retailing and rapid replenishment, the need for faster production is what drives these capital-intensive technical innovations. Because some U.S. manufacturers have found that centralizing preassembly operations also improves the quality of products, this may provide another edge for American apparel-makers in the future.<n>Our survey indicates that the average length of time it takes to get a garment ready for sewing, from issuing the order for a given marker to having the pieces cut and otherwise prepared, is 4.9 working days. The cut parts are then sent to sewing areas or other factories. If the sewing room is in the same building as the cutting room, then cut goods are sent over many times a day. If the sewing factory is far away, then a shipment once a week is typical. Reducing the time from placement of the order to cut goods in the sewing room requires decreasing both the time it takes to complete preassembly and the wait for delivery to the sewing room. Indeed, logistical considerations enter assembly well before garments are finally sewn together. Time really is money in today’s apparel industry, a theme we will expand on in the next two chapters.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
Low Rider<n>The expression “low rider” is used to describe the car, the subculture, and the person who drives a vehicle that has been lowered, rides very low, and has been customized. A car, truck, bicycle, van, or motorcycle that has been lowered—and this can be achieved by various methods—means that it sits very close to the ground and has a sleek streamlined appearance. The driver and/or owner is called a low rider and the act of low riding refers to all the activities associated with driving the car: cruising, caravanning, and hopping. Low riders have commonly been associated with cholos (1990s urban youth) and gangs, but traditionally Chicanos seriously involved in low riding and customizing low-rider cars are not involved in gangs, and low-rider clubs actually present an alternative to gang involvement. Low-rider car clubs communicate a message of cultural pride and unity. Although different, the cholo subculture can be closely linked to the low-rider subculture.<n>It is not clear when low riding started, but it was already a custom by the 1930s in Los Angeles and Sacramento, although the name “low rider” did not come into usage until the 1960s. After World War II, because of the growth in the economy, many Chicanos could afford to buy cars, old and new, and the practice of customizing cars and cruising became very popular throughout the Southwest and California during the 1950s. The most popular cars to lower are long ones, such as Fords, Buicks, and Chevrolets. Hydraulic lifts are used to lower and raise both the front and rear ends of a car. Before it was discovered that a hydraulic lift could be used with the batteries stored in the trunk of the car, different methods were used to lower the chassis of the car. Early crude methods were to place heavy bricks and cement bags in the trunk, or to cut the spring’s coils, or lower the car’s blocks. To give the car that lowered look the top might be cut back to lower the roof. In recent times, once a car is “lifted” or “all juiced up,” the driver controls the lift with a hand control.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
Having now defined the dimensionality of the adjacent possible and noted that the biosphere and universe as a whole is vastly nonergodic, hence, kinetically trapped in a small region of its total space of possibilities, it is fair to wonder whether general laws may govern this nonergodic flow. Given that the dimensionality of the adjacent possible of the biosphere has expanded in the past . billion years, I want to make the obvious conjecture at a law: Our biosphere and any biosphere expands the dimensionality of its adjacent possible, on average, as rapidly as it can.<n>I will return just below to think about bounds on this expansion. For, as we will see, it seems reasonable that if the expansion were too rapid, the system would destroy the propagating organization of autonomous agents whose coevolution and increasing diversity is what drives expansion into the adjacent possible and tends secularly to increase that dimensionality. Autonomous agents persistently stumble onto new ways of making a living with one another and exploit those new ways. The biosphere’s advance into the adjacent possible is just exaptation over and over again.<n>In fact, it seems reasonable to think of the “workspace” of the biosphere, that is, what can happen next, as its actual plus its real adjacent possible. It seems likely, and I do conjecture, that the biosphere is expanding its workspace, on average, as fast as it can do so without destroying itself in the process.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
Look next at the Boolean function for gene B in Figure .c. If gene A is , then gene B is sure to be the next moment, regardless of the activities of B and C. So A is a canalyzing input to B. But if B is , that too assures that B will be at the next moment. So B is a canalyzing input to itself. And similarly, if gene C is , gene B is sure to be the next moment. Gene B has three canalyzing inputs. By contrast, gene A in Figure .c has no canalyzing input, so is not a canalyzing Boolean function. No value of A alone, B alone, or C alone suces to guarantee the next activity of gene A.<n>In general, Boolean functions of K inputs may have ,,,   .   .   .     K canalyzing inputs. Numerical evidence shows that, for K > inputs per gene, a sucient bias toward a high fraction of genes with a sucient number of canalyzing inputs drives networks from the chaotic into the ordered regime. Figure .b shows the phase transition curve in the CK plane.<n>Before turning back to biology, it is essential to stress that the results noted above for synchronous Boolean networks extend to asynchronous Boolean networks and, more critically, extend to a family of model gene networks in which the genes have graded levels of activity. This is important because the on-o Boolean idealization is quite severe. Real genes show graded levels of activities as a function of the concentrations of their trans acting inputs and the bound states of their cis regulatory loci. If our results were fragile in that they depended upon the Boolean, on-o idealization, we could not trust them to inform us about real cells. Glass and Hill have examined a model with continuously graded levels of gene activity, the “piecewise linear model,” and found the same qualitative behaviors. In particular, the same phase transition occurs as a function of K, P, and C. The striking dierence, however, is that deep in the ordered regime of the piecewise linear case, the genes of the twinkling green islands settle down to steady states that dier on dierent attractors. Near the phase transition to chaos, the green islands begin to exhibit sustained “limit cycle” oscillations that become chaotic in the chaotic regime.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt

Rooms 7–35 concentrate on sculpture — perhaps the greatest collection of ancient sculpture in the world — and these are displayed to show the chronological development of the art form. Simply styled male and female figures (kouros and kore) of the Achaiac Age (seventh–fifth century b.c.) give way to more ornate and literal human forms as you walk through the collection into the Classical Age and then on to the Hellenistic and Roman eras. Greek gods are popular themes, followed by eminent human figures of Roman times. Room 7 holds the important early statue of Artemis by Nikandre of Naxos (c640 b.c.).<n>Room 15 is dominated by a fine statue of Poseidon in bronze (460 b.c.) found in the sea off the island of Euboea. The god is set to launch his trident against foes unknown. The Hall of the Stairs hosts another statue dredged from the sea, that of the Jockey of the Artemision. The diminutive jockey drives on the handsome steed which has its two front legs raised into the air, as if about to leap over an invisible obstacle.<n>Rooms 36–39 have a collection of bronzes including votive offerings found at the Idaean Cave in Crete — mythical birthplace of the god Zeus. Rooms 40 and 41 display artifacts from Egypt covering every era of history in the land of the Pharaohs, including the Ptolemaic period when Ptolemy (a general under Alexander the Great, and therefore of Greek descent) took control of Egypt. One of his descendants was Cleopatra, perhaps this most famous ancient queen.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
While you’re on the north side of town, take a drive around the Hollywood Hills for a superb view of the city. The classic Los Angeles cruise is along Mulholland Drive.

Fans of James Dean will recognize the Observatory — it was the scene of the climax of Rebel Without a Cause. The panorama from the terrace on a clear day is fantastic, from the spiky skyscrapers of downtown to the distant Pacific. Griffith Park is the biggest city park in the United States.

Golf and Tennis<n>Golf. The area from Punta Mita on the northern tip of Banderas Bay to Manzanillo in the south is beginning to rival Los Cabos as Mexico’s golf mecca. Six exceptional golf courses are located here, notable not only for their challenging designs coupled, with ocean and jungle views, but also for their absence of crowds and reasonable prices. The newest is the Jack Nicklaus–designed course at the Four Seasons Punta Mita (Tel. (3) 291-6000) located 30 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta, notable for a spectacular hole that drives to a natural island 175 yards offshore. Currently, it is open only to guests of the Four Seasons, or members of other golf clubs with a letter of introduction. Two other courses are located near Puerto Vallarta: Club de Golf Flamingos (Tel. (3) 298-0606), a casual course open to the public, and the Joe Finger–designed course at the Marina Vallarta Golf Club (Tel. (3) 221-0073). Four new courses are scheduled to open in the surrounding area by mid 2001.<n>Traveling south along the Costa Alegre, two spectacular courses offer exclusive play and multiple ocean views. Isla Navidad (Tel. (3) 355-5103) is one of Mexico’s top-rated resort courses, designed by Robert Von Hagge. It features wide-open fairways and big greens, with plenty of water, including eight oceanside holes. The course at El Tamarindo (Tel. (3) 551-5031) may not be as renown as the others, but it is a lush beauty of a course set in a tropical rainforest by the sea. The approaches to the holes wind through jungle paths, and fairways and greens are gently worked into the mountainous terrain bordering the Pacific Ocean.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt
