. [SEP] The result is beautiful, but has two problems. [SEP] First, Feynman assumes a continuous background space and time in his theory. [SEP] Quantum gravity, as we will see, cannot make that assumption in the first place. [SEP] Rather space, or geometry, is a discrete, self-constructing object on its own. [SEP] Thus, achieving a smooth space and time is supposed to be a consequence of an adequate theory of quantum gravity. [SEP] If Feynman’s sum over histories must assume a smooth background space and time, then it cannot as such be taken as primitive in quantum gravity. [SEP] Second, granting a continuous background space and time, Feynman’s sum over all histories still only gives a maximum of the amplitude for the photon to travel the classical pathway, it never gives an actual photon	arriving	at the counting surface. [SEP] No more than any other does Feynman overcome the fundamental linearity of quantum mechanics. [SEP] We still have to collapse the wave function. [SEP] Despite these problems, Feynman’s results are brilliant, and at least we see a link between the classical and quantum worlds, if not yet actual photons striking counters. [SEP] But there is an alternative approach to the link between the quantum and the classical worlds. [SEP] This possible approach is based on the well-established phenomenon of “decoherence.” [SEP] Decoherence arises when a quantum-coherent Schrödinger wave is propagating and the quantum system interacts with another quantum system having many coupled variables, or degrees of freedom. [SEP] The consequence can be that the Schrödinger wave functi	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	2
Arguably James Clerk Maxwell was the greatest scientist of the nineteenth century, notwithstanding giants such as Carnot, Boltzmann, and Darwin. [SEP] While his most radical work is captured in the Maxwell equations for electromagnetic fields, which introduced the fundamental concept of fields into physics, Maxwell concerned himself deeply with the puzzle Carnot had raised in what is now called the second law of thermodynamics. [SEP] Consider again a thermodynamically isolated system. [SEP] That is, consider some box containing a gas, isolated from any change in its energy or mass	arriving	from the outside. [SEP] There are N gas particles in the box, and as noted earlier, we can consider the positions and momenta of all N particles. [SEP] Each position and each momentum can be decomposed into three numbers defining position and motion in the three spatial directions. [SEP] Hence, the entire state of the N particles of gas can be defined by N numbers, plus a specification of the interior boundaries of the box. [SEP] As described above, all the possible states of this N system of particles can be divided into very small volumes of states, which we will call microstates. [SEP] Again, as noted in chapter , a macrostate is a collection of microstates. [SEP] In particular, the equilibrium macrostate is a collection of microstates having the property that the gas particles are nearl	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	2

[SEP] The incoming molecule is “yuck” or “yum.” [SEP] I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent. [SEP] And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind. [SEP] If yum, then there will probably be more of this type of agent, osprings of the first. [SEP] If yuck, it is not so likely this lineage will prosper.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt	arrive	written	OANC_written	2
ble to calculate the mutual information, MI, between pairs of the M action states. [SEP] MI is H(A) + H(B) - H(AB). [SEP] Here H(A) is the entropy of A, H(B) the entropy of B, and H (AB) is the joint entropy of A and B. If A and B are occurring randomly with respect to one another, then H(AB) equals the sum of H(A) + H(B), so MI is . [SEP] If either A or B is unchanging, MI is again . [SEP] But if A and B are changing in correlated ways, MI is positive. [SEP] Hence, we can ask what value of M maximizes the mutual information among the M states, how is that related to cell and community position on the edge-of-chaos phase transition in Figure . [SEP] , and how well does the mutual information among the M action states correlate with the mutual information in the patterns of CS input signals	arriving	at each cell type? [SEP] More broadly, can selection maximize both M and that mutual information correlation and, if so, for what value of M and where on or o the phase transition surface in Figure . [SEP] ?

[SEP] Slave traders, treasure seekers, and missionaries all followed in Lanzarotto’s wake, but it was not until 1402 that the European conquest of the Canaries began in earnest. [SEP] At its helm was the Norman baron, Jean de Béthencourt, under service to Henry III, king of Castile.

[SEP] Interestingly, the mountains here, which range between 1,000 and 1,700 meters (3,300 and 5,600 ft), are the first stop for clouds	arriving	from the Atlantic, giving the area the greatest annual rainfall in Spain.
