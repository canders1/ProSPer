of the last century, which, in the words of Alfred Chandler, reduced “the number of transactions involved in the flow of goods, increased the speed and regularity of the flow, and so lowered costs and improved the productivity of the American distribution system.”9 Yet it often takes time for an economy to reflect the impact of such fundamental shifts. [SEP] In fact, the current combination of changes in information technology, management practice, and manufacturing strategy may be one of the places where the impact of computers on the economy has been hidden until recently.10 [SEP] The falling costs of conducting business between retailers and their suppliers may also explain why there has been relatively little vertical concentration across industries in the channel—no textile firms have	gone	into the manufacture of apparel or retail and few apparel firms have set up their own retail outlets.11 [SEP] Indeed, an effective information-integrated channel probably works against vertical integration. [SEP] Sharing information and current knowledge of the market across channel players achieves some of the same objectives—at lower cost—of formally reaching forward or backward into markets. [SEP] Enterprises in different parts of the channel can therefore concentrate on their business strengths. [SEP] Lean retailing and the restructuring of manufacturing supply have also affected the economy as a whole in the area of inventories. [SEP] Lean retailing itself implies a dramatic reduction in the amount of inventory held by retail enterprises.

 well, opportunities to act out and coordinate various roles probably help children grasp similarities and differences between people in desires, beliefs, and feelings. [SEP] Recently, a mother recounted to me a make-believe episode initiated by her 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Traci, involving extended experimentation with and reversals of roles, which led to abundant dialogue about mental states. [SEP] One evening, Traci, her two older sisters, and her parents had gathered in the living room to watch a video of The Sound of Music. [SEP] Although Traci showed little interest in the movie, her ears perked up at a statement in the sound track reporting the death of the mother of the Trapp-family children. [SEP] Traci began to ask questions, to talk about how the mother must have gotten sick and	gone	to the hospital, and to repeat that the mother had died. [SEP] For the next hour and a half, she assigned her own mother and herself at least ﬁfteen different roles—mother, father, baby, sister, doctor, nurse, and more—as she explored the idea of a mother dying: Traci: “Here, you’re the baby and I’m the mama. Honey, I’m going to the hospital.”	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
les have been important community social and cultural events. [SEP] In Texas, New Mexico, and California, because of the isolation of the communities, dancing became the principal source of entertainment. [SEP] The social status of women in Spanish colonial society was limited and cloistered, with their primary social venues consisting of church and home. [SEP] El baile provided entertainment and physical activity. [SEP] As an early California traveler put it, “I was astonished at the endurance of the California women in holding out, night after night, in dancing, of which they never seemed to weary, but kept on with an appearance of freshness and elasticity that was as charming as surprising” (Shay 100). [SEP] It was at el baile that courtship occurred (since girls, although they may have	gone	to the dance chaperoned, were allowed to dance with boys); it was at el baile that families and relatives interacted, that the week’s work was forgotten, and that life’s mysteries were discussed. [SEP] The local dance brought the community together and allowed interaction between the sexes. [SEP] A girl was never able to reject a request to dance from a boy, because to turn down an invitation exposed the boy to embarrassment and ridicule for his failure in competition, and could be cause for revenge. [SEP] Countless corridos (ballads), leyendas (legends), and chistes (jokes) narrate events that are supposed to have occurred at el baile, from fights to courtships to elopements.

nda was revamping the legal system. [SEP] In 1804, he charged a group of lawyers with the task of drafting a new civil code in language accessible to ordinary people. [SEP] The committee produced the elegant Code civil, now a mainstay of French culture and a model for civil codification all over the world. [SEP] The language is so refined that the novelist Henri Stendhal reportedly reviewed the style of ten code provisions every night before retiring. [SEP] Today, when the Francophones in Quebec preach the distinctiveness of their culture, they never fail to mention their Code civil, modeled after Napoleon’s effort to use the law as the means of restoring civilized order to France. [SEP] The Code civil has proved to be remarkably durable in French culture. [SEP] Constitutions have come and	gone	and the French have endured recurrent changes of regime, including communes, dictatorships, and five distinct republics. [SEP] Yet, through all this, the civil code has survived. [SEP] It is the cultural monument that unites the French across history. [SEP] In its substantive content, the Code civil is strongly identified with the achievements of the 1789 Revolution against the ancien regime. [SEP] The code sweeps away the vestiges of feudal influence in the law of property and in the law of evidence and proclaims a liberal legal order. [SEP] The end of feudalism in the law of property meant that a single concept of ownership would replace the ancient system of embedded estates. [SEP] The implication was that all land would be freely alienable, without being burdened by the residual control	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
s of the servitudes prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment. [SEP] That concept had the potential of inducing a new role for government in the relationships between private parties. [SEP] If servitudes should be understood as relationships of domination, then an open-ended approach to the concept would have generated a watchdog role for the federal government in inspecting and supervising private relationships of potential exploitation and domination. [SEP] The Crescent City Company’s domination of the independent butchers, who had to pay tribute to practice the slaughtering trade, should have been a paradigm of impermissible domination. [SEP] And the other paradigm of coerced servitude would have been the domination of blacks by whites in a segregated society. [SEP] Had these two decisions	gone	the other way, a triadic relationship with government would have emerged. [SEP] The triangle would have consisted in the potentially dominant private party, the potentially subservient private party, and the government as the guarantor of relationships of equality and nondomination. [SEP] It is not clear which branch of the federal government would have benefited most from a triadic relationship with private parties. [SEP] Congress would have exercised its authority to legislate under the Thirteenth Amendment. [SEP] The executive would have established commissions to keep tabs on relationships that came to public attention. [SEP] Although the judiciary probably would have prospered as well, the Supreme Court of the 1870s and 1880s did not want to see the federal government become the watchd	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
 with two ends, or closed loops, with no free ends. [SEP] Among the fundamental ideas of string theory is the idea that the dierent particles and the dierent forces can all be thought of as dierent modes of vibration of such strings. [SEP] Because strings have finite length, string theory can hope to overcome the infinities that emerge when attempts are made to marry point particle quantum theories with general relativity in a continuous space-time. [SEP] In eect, the finite length of the strings prevents consideration of space becoming infinitely curved at a point. [SEP] Thus, string theory can dream of uniting quantum mechanics and general relativity, and it has, in fact, produced the entity carrying the gravitational force, the graviton, in a natural way. [SEP] Current string theory has	gone	beyond single-dimensional strings, and now considers two-or-higher-dimensional entities called M-branes. [SEP] The rough present state of the art has shown that there are at least five one-dimensional string theories and M-brane theory. [SEP] All of these theories appear to be linked as cousins of one another via various dualities among the theories. [SEP] String theories posit either eleven-or-fewer-dimensional space and time, with three of the spatial dimensions unfurled and large scale, corresponding to our familiar three-dimensional space. [SEP] The remaining dimensions are imagined as curled up on the Planck length scale in what are called “Calabi-Yau” spaces, or more generally, compactified moduli. [SEP] Compactification of an eleven-dimensional space and time can be thought of as a l	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
at are well searched by mutation and recombination. [SEP] Restated, assuming that mutation and recombination are, in fact, good search procedures for the kinds of fitness landscapes inhabited by we mere mortals as we were hanging around and adaptively hill climbing for the past four billion years, I ask again: Whence these wonderful fitness landscapes that are so well suited to be climbed by mutation and recombination? [SEP] Let’s try another tack. [SEP] Assume for the sake of discussion that I am right about my formulation of molecular autonomous agents. [SEP] When life = and I argue, autonomous agents = began, their diversity was low. [SEP] There are now some hundred million species, representing perhaps a thousandth of the total diversity that has wandered our globe. [SEP] The rest have	gone	extinct. [SEP] Natural games, ways of making a living, have obviously coevolved with the autonomous agents, the species, making those livings. [SEP] So, as I imagined Darwin telling us in chapter 1, “The winning natural games are the games the winning species play.” [SEP] Well, of course, the winning natural games are the games the winners play. [SEP] But what natural games are these? [SEP] The reasonable answer leaps to mind. [SEP] The winning games must be those that are readily searched out by the very adaptive search procedures used by the coevolving autonomous agents themselves.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
I will content myself with wondering where “value” and the rudiments of “intentionality” come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts. [SEP] Where is the place of value in a world of fact? [SEP] So, a short soliloquy. [SEP] Facts are know-that statements. [SEP] But know-how preceded know that. [SEP] While fully aware of Hume’s injunction, I think that from the autonomous agent’s perspective, yuck or yum is primary, unavoidable, and of the deepest importance to that agent. [SEP] I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria. [SEP] Too much yuck, this one and its progeny are	gone	from the future of the biosphere. [SEP] Without attributing consciousness to an E. coli, or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future, I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around. [SEP] And again without attributing consciousness, once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present? [SEP] If so, another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid. [SEP] Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible. [SEP] You are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control. [SEP] To act ethically, you must first be able to act at all.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
But I find myself troubled by this view and will provide an example of why. [SEP] Millions of years ago, the last female trilobite, Tomasina, was hurrying to find a good place to lay her eggs. [SEP] Suddenly, Tomasina saw a hideous starfish, named Darthvader, dead ahead. [SEP] “Left or right? What shall I do?” she wondered. [SEP] Tomasina jumped left. [SEP] Darthvader jumped right, caught Tomasina, killed her, and devoured her and her eggs. [SEP] There are no more trilobites. [SEP] Moreover, when Tomasina died, she took with her the unique proteins and small molecules that were trilobite molecular species. [SEP] These kinds of molecules are	gone	from the biosphere. [SEP] So too are descendant mutant molecules that might have arisen from further speciation from Tomasina’s tribe. [SEP] Furthermore, other chemical reactions, which might have been catalyzed transforming some molecular species to others that Tomasina’s molecules and those of her descendants might have catalyzed, have perhaps never come to be in the biosphere that has evolved over the succeeding eons. [SEP] Now, Tomasina is lost as an entire organism acting in an environment. [SEP] Yet the causal consequences of her wrong guess of direction to jump have propagated downward to lower levels of organization, namely the molecular species of which the biosphere is composed.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
Coda Richard Morris Hunt was the most celebrated American architect of the late nineteenth century. [SEP] His preeminence is reflected by his appointment as the architect of two important national works: the centerpiece building of the Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition, and the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty. [SEP] He was feted at home and abroad. [SEP] Hunt was the first architect to receive an honorary doctorate from Harvard and the first American to receive a Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects, and he was made an honorary member of the French Académie and a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. [SEP] A hundred years later, his counterpart is Frank O. Gehry. [SEP] Since being awarded the prestigious Pritzker Prize in 1989, Gehry has	gone	on to win more honors than any other living architect, including such major arts awards as the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize (a non-architectural award of which he is the first recipient) and the Japanese Praemium Imperiale, the Nobel of the art world. [SEP] Even the staid American Institute of Architects, which had previously shunned Gehry in lieu of more mainstream practitioners, awarded him its top accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. [SEP] No pair of architects could be more dissimilar than this distinctly odd couple, the proper High Society favorite of the Gilded Age and the untidy bohemian from Santa Monica.

[SEP] The main street of Lagos is the charming, cobbled Rua 25 de Abril, packed with restaurants, bars, and antiques and ceramics shops. [SEP] The side streets hold some good art (and craft) galleries and plenty of rewards for exploration. [SEP] The square at the end of 25 de Abril holds a curious statue, which some liken to an extraterrestrial, of the boy-king Sebastião. [SEP] In 1568 Sebastian became king of Portugal at age 14. [SEP] A decade later he embarked on a disastrous voyage to Morocco to fight the Moors. [SEP] At least 7,000 troops died, the king included (though many refused to believe he had perished, and Elvis-like sightings were common).	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
. [SEP] Ask at hotels, travel agencies, and tourist information offices to find out what is scheduled during your stay. [SEP] They’ll probably point you towards some of the commercial performances put on in several villages, mostly in the Ubud area. [SEP] Tickets (including transport) are sold at the tourist office in Ubud and by many of the tour operators. [SEP] Increasingly, the culture is packaged and brought to you in shows staged at hotels. [SEP] Some of these are of a very high standard: Dedicated dancers and musicians usually do give their best. [SEP] But inevitably the atmosphere is different when they are performing for untutored tourists eating dinner, rather than for an expert village audience — and above all for their gods. [SEP] Drama and dance students will think that they’ve	gone	to heaven when they see the unique temple ceremonies. [SEP] If you are invited, be prepared to wait for a long time. [SEP] Starting times are highly elastic, and then some events will last for many hours. [SEP] Many of the dances of Bali are also performed in western Lombok, either for the Balinese community there or, increasingly, for the tourists at Senggigi hotels. [SEP] Lombok also has its own special dances, which are rarely staged commercially. [SEP] Some are for men only — one simulating battle preparations probably derives from the Islamic tradition. [SEP] The gandrung dance closely resembles Bali’s joged, in that a girl picks a male partner from the audience. [SEP] Another group of dances is based on romantic legends from Sasak mythology, dating back to before the advent of Islam. 	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhatToDo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
creasing numbers. [SEP] Tales were told in Australia about the “perfect wave,” and Kuta became the dream destination for every surfer. [SEP] Once a poor fishing village and wasteland believed to be inhabited by bad spirits, by the 1980s it was transformed into a frenetic scene, fueled by plenty of alcohol and, for a while, illegal drugs. [SEP] The height limit was virtually the only regulation applied to building, and a sprawling shantytown soon sprang up. [SEP] Theft and prostitution (chiefly blamed on incomers from the other islands) looked as if they were becoming endemic. [SEP] On and off the beach, every foreigner was plagued by hawkers as adhesive as bush flies. [SEP] Eventually, voices were heard at banjar meetings urging a clean-up and the raising of standards. [SEP] Today Kuta has	gone	a long way toward putting its house right. [SEP] Drugs have largely disappeared and crime rates are down, although you still need to beware of pickpockets and shouldn’t leave property unguarded. [SEP] Traffic, however, remains Kuta’s nightmare. [SEP] Kuta, and its progressively upscale neighbors to the north — Legian, Seminyak, and Kerobokan (as well as Tuban, to the south) — provide an enormous selection of hotels, restaurants, pubs, and shopping choices. [SEP] In all price ranges, you’ll find some of the best Italian, French, Vegetarian, Asian, and Mexican restaurants on the island, as well as some of the best shops for crafts from other islands, fashion, locally produced ikat cloth, and casual Bali-style beach clothing. [SEP] In keeping with its new image, Kuta has begun to acquire the t	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
The spirit of liberalism prevalent in Europe was tardy in reaching Spain. [SEP] After many reverses, a democratic constitution was finally proclaimed and constitutional monarchy was instituted in 1874. [SEP] Four years later, Barcelona was at long last given the right to trade with the colonies of the New World. [SEP] Meanwhile, the city had	gone	about its business, devoting its energies to industrialization. [SEP] Barcelona’s medieval walls were torn down to make way for an expansion in the mid-19th century. [SEP] The Eixample, an elegant modern district, was laid out on a grid of broad avenues where the new industrialists built mansions. [SEP] Wealthy patrons supported forward-looking architects, including Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Muntaner, who embraced modernisme. [SEP] Prosperity was accompanied by a revival in Catalan arts and letters, a period known in Catalan as the Renaixença (Renaissance). [SEP] In a burst of optimism, the city bid for worldwide recognition with the Universal Exposition of 1888, built on the site of the hated Ciutadella fortress. [SEP] With the industrial expansion, an urban working class evolved i	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
The port is busy with boats from the Royal Yacht Club, cruise ships, and ferries to Mallorca. [SEP] Overhead, aerial cable cars link Montjuïc with Barceloneta. [SEP] The newest addition to the port is the World Trade Center, an I.M. Pei-designed complex of offices “floating” in the harbor. [SEP] Prior to the Olympics, the harbor area was upgraded, transforming the Moll de la Fusta, the wood-loading quay, into a broad promenade. [SEP] Once again Barcelonans can stroll by the sea, although almost all the new restaurants that moved in with the refurbishment have	gone	belly-up (their shells have been replaced by weekend discotheques). [SEP] A large and convenient parking garage is located underneath. [SEP] Barceloneta	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
ation of Empress Dowager Cixi, who in 1908 converted this private Ming Dynasty garden estate into a preserve for some 700 exotic animals imported from Germany. [SEP] The entrance gate dates from the late Qing Dynasty, and many of the exhibition halls seem nearly as old. [SEP] Even the outdoor pens seem quite dated. [SEP] With some 6,000 animals the zoo is the largest in China, but despite its notable collection of giant pandas, Siberian tigers, golden monkeys, and red-crowned cranes, the facility is in need of modernization. [SEP] Few foreign visitors are happy with the size and condition of the cages, although the new Panda Garden, featuring a half-dozen adult pandas and twin babies, is a bit more spacious and a step in the right direction. [SEP] Most of the zoo’s recent major funding has	gone	to the creation of the adjacent Beijing Aquarium, a state-of-the-art marine park scheduled to have 50,000 aquatic species in residence.

se, South Road joins Middle Road, which continues on toward Bermuda’s West End (bus routes [SEP]7 and [SEP]8). [SEP] Vestiges of the Railway Trail intertwine with the road in this area. [SEP] Half a mile from the junction, look out for Industrial Park Road on the left, where you will find Bermuda Triangle Brewing. [SEP] It produces such memorable concoctions as Wilde Hogge and Hammerhead. [SEP] The brewery offers guided tours that demonstrate the brewing process from fermentation to bottling, with free samples of freshly brewed beer. [SEP] In the summer months there are tours daily at 4pm; in winter the tours are on Saturday only. [SEP] Farther along Middle Road a small lane leads to West Whale Bay, a small body of water that got its name from the whales that were slaughtered here in years	gone	by. [SEP] Port Royal Golf Course, one of the oldest on the island, fills much of this area before the road leads on to Somerset Island.

, the Kwakiutl of British Columbia’s Pacific coast on and around Vancouver Island count among the aristocrats of Canadian native peoples. [SEP] For centuries, they have harvested an abundance of fish from the ocean and rivers — not just salmon but halibut, herring, mussels, and clams. [SEP] From the forests they have hewed red cedar planks for handsomely crafted houses and 22-m (65-ft) canoes to negotiate the coastal waters. [SEP] Before European textiles arrived on the scene, the Kwakiutl pounded cedar bark until it was supple and soft enough to weave into capes, skirts, and blankets. [SEP] The mild climate and generally easy living have given them the leisure to develop artistic talents less apparent among native peoples and Inuit facing harsher conditions. [SEP] Elaborate decoration has	gone	into fashioning the simplest everyday objects — clothing, baskets, storage boxes, even fishhooks. [SEP] Carpentry is the most valued of Kwakiutl skills, and is spectacularly displayed in their totem poles. [SEP] But this is not an ancient art form. [SEP] The huge freestanding red cedar poles erected in front of their houses are essentially a 19th-century phenomenon, dependent, for their intricate design, on the chisels, steel axes, curved knives, and other metal tools bartered from Europeans for the skins of sea otters. [SEP] Size was originally limited to that of the poles and beams used to build the house, to which the carvings were directly attached. [SEP] Then, as personal wealth diminished with a slump in the fur trade, totem poles became prime symbols of a chief’s prestige, soaring to	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
Casinos. [SEP] Casinos Poland runs gaming facilities in hotels in three cities covered in this guide: in Warsaw, Hotel Marriott (Al. Jerozolimskie 65/79; Tel. 630 63 06); in Kraków, Hotel Continental (Novotel) (Al. Armii Krajowej 11; Tel. 637 50 44); and in Poznan, Hotel Merkury (ul. Roosevelt 20; Tel. 855 80 00). [SEP] In Warsaw, there are also casinos at the Dom Chlopa Hotel (Powstanców Warszawy 2; Tel. 827 58 10); Polonia Hotel (Al. Jerozolimskie 45; Tel. 622 31 23); and Victoria Hotel (ul. Królewska 11; Tel. 827 66 33). [SEP] Cinema. [SEP] Poland has an enviable cinematic tradition and has produced great film directors who’ve	gone	on to international success, including Krzysztof Kie§lowski, Andrzej Wajda, and Roman Polanski. [SEP] Poles are dedicated moviegoers, so in the cities you’ll find plenty of subtitled Western films on the marquees competing with home-grown product, showing at good, Dolby sound-equipped theaters. [SEP] Film admissions are cheap by comparison with many countries. [SEP] Look for the Warsaw Film Festival in October every year. [SEP] Clubs and Bars. [SEP] Poland’s towns and cities teem with bars, pubs, cafés, and nightclubs, and Poles have—fairly or unfairly—a reputation as heavy drinkers. [SEP] The days of hard-drinking men emptying bottles of vodka in plain, poorly lit bars are largely a thing of the past, though, and most young Poles today drink more beer (piwo) than vodka and other spirits.

od and part trompe l’oeil; and the Igreja de São Vicente, where Pedro I claimed to have married Inês de Castro (see page 45). [SEP] The barren and wild Parque Natural de Montesinho lies between Bragança and Spain, and is home to a number of small, isolated villages that have striven to keep up their traditions of communal ownership and pre-Christian ritual. [SEP] They share this landscape with wolves and boars. [SEP] For hardcore hikers, Montesinho is a delight. [SEP] For details of campsites, visit the park office in Bragança. [SEP] The tiny village of Rio de Onor, 24 km (15 miles) to the northeast, is a village that time forgot and a geographical oddity. [SEP] The town straddles the border: half is in Portugal, half in Spain (where it’s called Rihonor de Castilla). [SEP] Locals have long	gone	back and forth between Portuguese and Spanish, with intermarriage between the two nationalities common.

good part of its original walls — most of them from the 16th century, but part-Roman in places — they have been rebuilt and expanded over the centuries. [SEP] Lagos was an important trading port under the Moors, but the town enjoyed its heyday after the Reconquest, when it was proclaimed the capital of the Algarve. [SEP] On Rua General Alberta da Silveira, the tiny chapel Igreja de Santo António, an exuberant gilt Baroque work and one of the Algarve’s finest churches, was rebuilt soon after the earthquake. [SEP] The entrance to the church is actually through the curious and eclectic museum next door, Museu Regional de Lagos. [SEP] Rooms display sacred art, archaeological remains, the original charter of Lagos, holy vestments, and a bizarre collection of creatures, like a science experiment	gone	bad: an eight-legged goat kid preserved in formaldehyde, a one-eyed sheep, a cat with two faces. [SEP] The main street of Lagos is the charming, cobbled Rua 25 de Abril, packed with restaurants, bars, and antiques and ceramics shops. [SEP] The beaches near Lagos range from Meia Praia, 1.6 km (1 mile) to the east, a long (4 km/2 miles) flat stretch, to pocket-sized coves just west of the city. [SEP] Weird and wonderful rock formations, and steep cliffs that glow orange at sunset, have made them some of the most photographed in Europe; head for Praia de Dona Ana and Praia do Camilo, both small, pretty, and crowded (street signs indicate the way to each).	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt	go	written	OANC_written	5
