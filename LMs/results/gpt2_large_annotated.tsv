The only solace that I can find is the hope that you will mourn for the return that I can not promise. Thinking of you, I am unable to sleep. The prayer call of the priests' silver trumpets has yet to mark the dawn, and I write by the light of an oil lamp, knowing this activity will not disturb my hosts. First, I wish you to know that I	arrived	safely for Passover, and I can report that Pascal and Seraphine are in good health. Now that my travel has ended, I have the luxury of applying markings to scroll. Far apart as we are, my intent is to begin each day of this week with you. I picture you listening to my letter and thus pretend we are in conversation. It aids me that I can imagine you reclining on your couch in our villa far above the harbor.	natural	natural	natural	COCA; 2004; Tyndale House Publishers; The weeping chamber; Brouwer, Sigmund, 1959; FIC: The weeping chamber	3	other; know	speaker	none

And how should I have known whether or not I should have believed them? According to their reports the entirety of that group of wondrous girls had one by one returned to Owl Mountain and knocked on Miss Lizzy Pettigru's door, along with their husbands and children from the far distant places where events in their lives had taken them. The postmistress told me that she saw letters from them that must have announced they were	coming	and saw letters go back to them from Lizzy Pettigru that must have told them they would be welcome when they arrived. (The postmistress was very open about all her observations and shameless in her speculations.) Sometimes it was postcards they would write her and it was welcoming postcards that she would send back.	natural	natural	natural	COCA: 1991 (Winter); Gambier: Winter 1991.
