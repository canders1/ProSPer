For example, in 1988, joint adoption of bar codes and EDI systems was uncommon: Only 25.2 percent of business units had adopted both, while 46.8 percent had adopted neither. By 1992, three-quarters of the business units had implemented both bar codes and EDI technologies, while only 8.0 percent had neither in place. Similar patterns of increased adoption can be seen among other combinations of these practices in Table 14.1.<n>The mere fact that two practices have been adopted, however, does not tell the whole story. The changing organization of the retail and apparel industries also suggests that there is a particular sequence for adopting the four key practices. To begin with, the adoption of bar codes came before rapid replenishment arrangements because retailers required a low-cost means of collecting information at the detailed product level for their own use—that is, they first developed an efficient method for scanning prices at the check-out register and tracking products for internal inventory purposes. Only after a common convention for bar codes had been established and in use for several years did retailers turn to such systems to transmit and receive data from suppliers.<n>Indeed, the use of bar codes, followed by implementation of EDI systems, provides the basic foundation for subsequent investments in efficient logistics management in retail distribution centers. Retailers do not get much out of investing in advanced distribution technologies, such as shipping container markers, if they lack a means for electronically identifying and using information concerning the contents of incoming shipments or of connecting that information back to suppliers for invoicing purposes. And suppliers get little return out of providing customers with standardized shipping container markers if neither of these channel players has made previous investments in bar codes and EDI.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch14.txt
To be sure, the international sourcing arrangements that have been created by retailers and manufacturers over the last twenty years reflect a quest for minimizing unit labor costs. But the long lead times they require will increasingly challenge such arrangements. Manufacturers and retailers that rely on international sourcing will therefore have to reassess the total costs associated with offshore production and revise existing arrangements.<n>Trade data already suggest a major restructuring in the sources of U.S. apparel imports. The surge in apparel imports in the 1980s came from low-wage countries, primarily the Asian “Big Four”—the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea. This group of nations provided 39 percent of all apparel imports in 1964 and 51 percent of all apparel imports by 1988 (measured in square-meter equivalents, a measure of quantity). But by 1996, the Big Four’s share of imports had fallen to 26 percent. Their U.S. share has been increasingly displaced by those of Mexico and Caribbean nations.35 Although these shifts in part reflect changes in U.S. trade policy, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), they fundamentally arise from new sourcing patterns attributable to channel integration and the consequent need for apparel items that can be delivered in a shorter time to the U.S. market.<n>The implications of these changes from a private and public policy perspective are enormous. Competing in the transformed retail-apparel-textile channel now requires a set of management practices for both domestic and international sourcing. A successful U.S. apparel-maker, for instance, may assemble basic men’s khaki pants in average sizes in Mexico, taking advantage of low labor costs as well as Mexico’s proximity to the maker’s Texas distribution centers; at the same time, this company can choose to manufacture products with more variable demand, like khaki pants with narrow waists and long inseams, in the United States, providing fast turnaround for retailers and lower exposure to inventory risk.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch1.txt
Then there was the parallel growth of mail-order sales. With the help of new transportation and communications systems, the first company to market a wide variety of consumer goods exclusively by mail and parcel post was Montgomery Ward, formed in 1872. The Grange, the largest organization of farmers, supported the company. By 1887, its catalog of 540 pages listed 24,000 items. But Sears Roebuck and Co. outstripped Montgomery Ward in the 1890s. As with the wholesaler-jobber and the emerging department stores, the buyers at Sears had full autonomy. Chandler notes, “Each merchandise department was a separate dynasty, and the buyer was in complete charge.”8<n>Department stores and mail-order houses (and later chain stores in food distribution) dominated mass retailing after 1880 through large volume, high inventory turnover, lower prices, payments in cash that reduced the need for credit and debt, and the crucial role of the buyer. Although wholesaler-jobbers had faded from the scene, the policies, practices, and administrative organizations of many mass distributors were derived from them. Other buying practices came from small shops. Each retail merchandise department, particularly in multi-store organizations, became a separate fiefdom, with the buyer in charge of product selection, scale, timing of orders, and pricing. Up until the mid-1980s, the buyers’ personal network of contacts and “feel” for what customers wanted determined marketing policy. And although the wages of nonsupervisory workers in retail have been and still are quite low,9 the compensation system for buyers provided substantial rewards for favorable results.<n>Consequently, for decades the decisions of buyers in retail organizations directly affected apparel and textile suppliers. The distribution system that emerged after 1870 would not be challenged until more than a century later. Only in the 1980s, with the development of another system of mass distribution that includes new technology, new management methods, and new links to manufacturing—lean retailing—did the role of the buyer significantly diminish.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
In colonial days, housewives typically did spinning, weaving, and tailoring for the family. The well-to-do purchased imported cloth and had apparel made by itinerant tailors or those in small shops. The ready-made garment industry grew out of altered rejects and secondhand clothing that were then sold to the poorer classes in the cities. In 1832, a 50 percent import duty curtailed clothing primarily from England and increased the demand for American home industry.10 By 1850, the U.S. Census reports that there were 4,278 establishments with 97,000 workers—63 percent of them women—in the ready-made clothing industry.11 Cloth was cut and assembled into bundles in these establishments, given out to workers to take home to sew, and returned for finishing operations.12<n>With the invention of the sewing machine by Howe, and its perfection by Singer in 1851, a new era began in the manufacture of clothing, when more work became concentrated in shops. The Civil War and the consequent need for uniforms stimulated the factory system, and the introduction of standard body-size measurements facilitated ready-to-wear clothing. When Hart, Schaffner, and Marx, for instance, opened its doors in 1879, only 40 percent of men’s suits were ready-made. By 1920, most men wore suits that came from a factory. In this period, a number of key technological changes appeared: sewing machines that made many more stitches a minute, long knives instead of shears for cutting, and pressing machines.<n>From the nineteenth century on, enterprises in the apparel industry have taken one of three general forms: the manufacturer with an inside shop; the jobber; and the contractor with an outside shop, which can supply either manufacturers or jobbers. The jobber, a form characteristic of women’s apparel, does not produce in a plant that it owns. Jobbers may purchase cloth and materials; design or purchase design of garments; and cut or contract out cutting of fabrics. They turn over sewing and assembly to contractors, and their main role is to merchandise finished product.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
Apparel workplaces have historically been located in major metropolitan areas—New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Rochester, Baltimore, Cleveland, St. Louis—and drawn on successive waves of immigrants. In the production of both men’s and women’s clothing, immigrant labor provided a continuing secure labor force that often already had the requisite skills. In 1930, three out of five workers were foreign born, and a large percentage of the native-born were of foreign parentage. The union in the men’s clothing field at the time issued official publications in eight different languages. Practically all the manufacturers were first-generation Jewish immigrants.18 More recently, apparel manufacturers, seeking lower labor costs, have moved to the American South and California. But a disproportionate number of domestic apparel workers are still immigrants.<n>Given access to a large pool of immigrant labor in urban centers, the jobber-contractor system in women’s apparel led to the wide-scale presence and abuses of sweatshops. Sweatshops at the turn of the century encompassed a range of workplaces in which, as one commentator noted, “Congestion, unsanitary quarters, lack of restriction on child labor, absolutely unregulated hours, and miserable pay combine to create a condition which endangers the lives not only of the workers, but of the purchasers of their products.”19 A study in 1893 of the “sweating system” estimated that one-half of the clothing manufactured at that time came from factories, while the other half originated in home work or was subcontracted in small shops often adjoining homes.20<n>Organizing a relatively low-skill immigrant workforce presented great challenges to unions in the garment industry. Employer resistance to unionization, arising from the highly competitive conditions in apparel markets and the significant percentage of total costs arising from labor, further compounded the problem. This difficult environment shaped the organizing and representation strategies of the two major unions—the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and the International Ladies’ Garment Workers Union (ILGWU)21—as well as their relations with employers through collective bargaining arrangements.22 Both unions established a foothold in the industry because they represented strategic workers in the apparel production process: the skilled cutter working inside manufacturers’ plants. Cutters required substantial training, and the withdrawal of their labor could quickly shut down all sewing and pressing operations. Because cutters worked on multiple layers of fabric at one time, their errors were likely to be costly. Not surprisingly, cutters were the highest paid workers receiving day rates.23<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt

Because cutters worked on multiple layers of fabric at one time, their errors were likely to be costly. Not surprisingly, cutters were the highest paid workers receiving day rates.23<n>By organizing cutters first, unions gained the leverage with which they could then organize and represent the much larger, but less skilled, group of sewers who worked in factory settings, particularly in the men’s industry, or in the small shops that characterized the women’s industry. The principal architects of this approach, Sidney Hillman, founding president of the Amalgamated, and David Dubinsky, long-time president of the ILGWU, were cutters and came out of this craft-group.24<n>Given this union foothold, collective bargaining in apparel focused on the standardization of labor in a market area and a product line. This was done because of the organization of work in clothing shops; the low capital costs and high proportion of labor costs, especially in women’s wear for contract shops; the intense product competition among manufacturers within and among geographic markets; and the diversity of products and changing styles. The unions drew on several different methods to standardize wages and conditions within the markets. For the ILGWU, standardizing wages required regulation through collective bargaining of the network of contractors and “submanufacturers” working for jobbers and manufacturers. Emphasizing the potential role of the union in this regard, ILGWU President Dubinsky commented on the difficult conditions of the 1920s:<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
Even if integration efforts in the past have been uncommon, information flows, transport, and inventory have always been decisive factors in shaping the relations among retail, apparel, and textile firms. As Alfred Chandler and other business historians have made clear, successive changes in information exchange and transport over the last century have reshaped relations among industries, as well as the internal organization of these enterprises. Chandler notes,<n>Significantly, it was in several of these [labor-intensive] more fragmented industries—textiles, apparel, furniture, and some food processing—that the mass retailer (the department stores, mail-order houses and chain stores) began to coordinate the flow of goods from manufacturer to consumer. In those industries where substantial economies of scale and scope did not exist in production, high-volume flows through the processes of production and distribution came to be guided—and the resulting cost reductions achieved—by the buying departments of mass retailers, retailers who handled a variety of related products through their facilities.43<n>And so we arrive at the new information technologies of the 1980s. These have begun to create integrated channels among enterprises in the three industries, facilitating even more product proliferation and stimulating changes in merchandising, inventory management, internal production practices, and methods of using human resources. When it comes to the driving force behind the late twentieth-century industrial transformation, lean retailing is at the forefront of that revolution.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
The Growing Costs of Traditional Retailing<n>Nevertheless, large-scale retailing came with its own risks. Through their buying power, traditional retailers could dramatically lower the direct costs of procurement and, in the process, usurp the role of wholesalers in the apparel distribution system.9 Purchasing in large quantities for their stores, however, subjected retailers to the attendant risk of selling “perishable” products like apparel. The absence of business systems capable of adjusting to real-time demand information, as well as the lack of information between the time when orders were placed and the actual selling season, meant that early order commitments could not be amended pending new information.10 In terms of the retail bottom line, this risk appeared in the indirect costs associated with holding inventories of unwanted products and stock-outs of popular items.11<n>Two trends over the past twenty-five years have compounded the problems inherent in the traditional retail model. First, product proliferation has vastly increased the number of products retailers are required to manage in their stores. Second, the total amount of retail space in the United States has expanded dramatically, even while consumer expenditures on apparel items have declined as a share of total expenditures. Some analysts deem this “the overstoring of America.” Since the early 1980s, retailers have faced the growing costs associated with holding inventories of a wider variety of goods in a world increasingly characterized by industry overcapacity. Low-cost international suppliers helped fill the gap for a while, but the traditional retail model can no longer hold its own without information integration and other innovations.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch3.txt
Wal-Mart reaped the full benefits arising from its extensive information systems when it shifted its focus from internal purposes to a means of interacting with suppliers. In 1987, Wal-Mart began its first major experiment in changing its relationship with a key supplier, Procter & Gamble, by establishing the “Wal-Mart Retail Link” program. This program provided Procter & Gamble with access to Wal-Mart’s point-of-sales information, allowing the supplier to track sales of its products on a real-time basis and manage its inventory accordingly. In the words of Lou Pritchett, Procter & Gamble’s vice president of sales at the time, “P&G could monitor Wal-Mart’s inventory and data and then use that information to make its own production and shipping plans with a great deal more efficiency. We broke new ground by using information technology to manage our business together, instead of just to audit it.”32<n>The Wal-Mart/Procter & Gamble partnership has been often cited by the business press. The program began through an informal discussion between Sam Walton and Procter & Gamble’s Pritchett. Although the effort has been characterized as a partnership, senior executives at Procter & Gamble have also noted that the initial impetus came from Walton. The partnership required Wal-Mart to switch from its internal proprietary standard to a more widely adopted electronic data interchange (EDI) standard, as well as to bar codes that were already in use by other retailers, particularly Kmart. Although Kmart was the first major retailer to experiment with EDI, Wal-Mart led the way in structuring supply relationships and its overall competitive strategy around information exchange. The program soon expanded to other vendors, including apparel suppliers, who entered their own “trading partnerships” with Wal-Mart. Thus, what began as a system focused on efficient distribution eventually evolved into the modern system of lean retailing.<n>National Chains: J. C.

Department Stores: Dillard’s and Federated<n>Although providing consumers with low prices for a limited range of goods underpins the strategy of mass merchants and national chains, department stores (going back to Wanamaker) rely on offering consumers a diverse and exciting collection of goods. The focus of department stores tends to be on the middle and higher portion of the fashion triangle; consequently, lean retailing came later to this segment of the industry.<n>Dillard’s was a pioneer in the use of information technology for tracking and responding to sales. Dillard’s became one of the first department stores in the late 1980s to build a centralized inventory-tracking system to provide its headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas, with real-time information on sales, by both store and item.35 This entailed buying and then adapting early scanning technologies for use at sales counters and for point-of-sale data collection. Dillard’s also purchased computing capacity for individual stores and its headquarters office, along with the necessary equipment to connect stores to the head office via electronic data transmission.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch3.txt
Meanwhile, the company sought to maintain the strengths of its divisions—Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, in particular—in merchandising. It created, among other innovations, a “team buying” system that centralizes certain buying functions to benefit from potential economies of scale while taking full advantage of divisional expertise regarding different customer groups within Federated’s stores. Yet a tension exists between its desire to provide customers with a changing variety of apparel fashions and the need to increase its capacity to replenish a higher percentage of products, thereby taking advantage of its expertise in logistics.38 Increasingly, a department store must be successful at both pursuits. We discuss the trade-off arising from providing new products with little information on consumer demand (fashion products) and replenishing items on the basis of sales (historically limited to more basic products) in detail in Chapter 6.<n>Although Wal-Mart’s rapid climb has created the most sound and fury, a variety of retailers adopted and adapted different pieces of lean retailing in the early 1990s. Note that the push toward rapid replenishment, reduction of lead times, and what has often been called “quick response” came predominately from retailers rather than from their apparel suppliers.39<n>The next chapter analyzes the building blocks of lean retailing, drawing on the retailers described above as well as others. Chapter 5 discusses how the retail revolution has led to a tremendous shift in bargaining power within the channel—away from manufacturers and suppliers and toward lean retailers.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch3.txt
Retailers’ calls to apparel manufacturers about late delivery are the basis for many a tall tale at retail conventions. In the past, the standard reply to a query about what had happened to an order was “It’s on the loading dock.” Information systems at apparel factories were primitive. If all the SKUs for an order were not in the warehouse, substitutions of the same style in a different size would be offered to the retailer. Or retailers might not even notice if an unplanned substitution had been made because their information systems were equally as primitive. If there were insufficient SKUs of the requested style, the order would be shorted or a phone call made to the retail buyer to negotiate a solution to the problem. If no SKUs of the order were in the finished goods warehouse, then the search of the factory floor—where there might be tens of thousands of partially completed items to look through—would begin.<n>Then along came lean retailing and the need for rapid replenishment—manufacturers are now expected to replenish products in less than a week. At first, only a few retailers required this, and apparel manufacturers tried to meet these needs with minimal changes in their internal practices. Often, this was done at the expense of a manufacturer’s non-lean retail customers. For example, the CEO of a men’s dress-shirt supplier reported to us in 1992 that its finished goods warehouse was divided into two areas. A locked section contained finished goods reserved for orders from Dillard’s, Inc., this manufacturer’s biggest customer and its only one with stringent rapid-replenishment requirements. The rest of the warehouse held inventory for all other retailers. If the locked section had insufficient inventory for a Dillard’s order, product from the rest of the warehouse could be picked and sent to Dillard’s, but no retailers could receive products from the locked section reserved for Dillard’s, no matter how severe their needs. This arrangement worked well from Dillard’s perspective; it found this firm to be one of its best rapid-replenishment suppliers, with high order-fulfillment rates and on-time deliveries—the main criteria for success. For the manufacturer, it meant a larger finished goods inventory and worse service for its other customers.<n>As long as only one or two retailers required rapid replenishment, manufacturers could get away with this type of solution. But it didn’t take long before most retailers wanted orders for basic apparel items replenished this way and they became very demanding. As an increasing number of suppliers are dancing to the demands of rapid replenishment, they are finding it a complex tune. Manufacturers suddenly have much more to do than just make clothing—they are being asked to do work previously done by the retailer, such as picking and packing the order for each store from the retailer’s warehouse. Each store’s order has to be put in a separate carton, labeled with its own bar code, and accompanied by an advance shipping notice. Moreover, retailers want an order to arrive at their distribution center at an exact time. If the truck is late, the driver often has to wait until the end of the day to unload, if allowed to do so at all. Deliveries made a day late are sometimes refused and sent back.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt
Both components of total inventory (work-in-process and finished goods) decrease as the most profitable production shifts to the short-cycle plant. Less finished goods inventory is required because finished goods can be rapidly replenished after a peak selling week.<n>Therefore, the amount of finished goods in the manufacturer’s distribution center needed to satisfy weekly demand for all SKUs depends on the cycle times of the plants supplying finished product, and what fraction of production is made in each plant. In the single-breasted coat example of the previous section, there was only one plant involved, which made the most profitable target inventory level a single number for each SKU.13 Increased profit came from missing fewer sales by being in stock a higher percentage of the time. In the second case, the finished goods in the distribution center are generally a blend of the output of two plants and the target inventory level varies with the quick-line capacity ratio. Most important, when a manufacturer considers two sourcing options, the one that offers the lowest direct cost is not always the most profitable.<n>The Manufacturer’s Dilemma in a Lean World<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt
The pants marker shown in Figure 8.1 was produced by this automatic layout software and yielded cloth utilization of 89.66 percent. The equivalent production marker made by the manufacturer’s highly skilled operator, using a computer but without HCTAR’s software, achieved a utilization of 89.54 percent, or just a little less than the fully automatic software system. Sometimes a human operator can beat the automatic system by a small amount, but the following example is typical. The production marker for the intimate apparel item in Figure 8.2 was initially laid out by a trained operator with 79.96 percent utilization; the HCTAR software compacted the marker and achieved cloth utilization of 81.54 percent, an improvement of 1.47 percent. One-third of the wholesale price of apparel is typically fabric cost. A 1 percent savings in fabric over the entire production goes directly to the bottom line. Such savings can add up to many millions of dollars for large manufacturers.<n>Based on our survey results, about two-thirds of the business units in 1992 generated markers by trained operators with computer assistance; when the survey response is weighted by dollars of yearly sales, however, 99.5 percent of the business units’ production came from computer-generated markers. In contrast, apparel operations in developing nations generally do not use computerized layout systems. Markers are made by hand, tracing pattern pieces onto sheets of paper from thick, pre-cut cardboard pattern elements. The primary alignment tool is the meter stick for measuring distances from the edge. It is not hard to imagine a tendency to allow a slight twist in individual pieces to achieve a closer fit between neighboring pieces.<n>There are also stories of subcontractors, in this country as well as overseas, crumpling a marker up so that when it is laid out again it will be just a little smaller in width and length—a trick to save a fraction of a percent from each piece. The savings can add up for the contractor, since the apparel manufacturer that supplied the cloth might not notice. As far as final quality is concerned, however, such arrangements create the wrong incentive—another reason why it may make more sense for U.S.-based manufacturers to control all aspects of preassembly, including marker-making and cutting.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
mealtime conversations.  Mealtimes—usually dinner—are special social contexts for families in complex societies. They are among the few occasions in which parents and children regularly gather after spending most of the day apart and in which the main family activity is relating to one another. Hence, mealtime talk overﬂows with opportunities for socialization.<n>Mealtimes and similar occasions for family togetherness open special conversational doors. Because all family members are present, dinner talk can convey to children a sense of family coherence and identity.101 Most of us can still recapture the stories our parents told us, in which social and moral lessons were powerful and abundant. Here is one my mother told me, recalled in vivid detail nearly a half century later: “Once, when your grandfather was 16 years old, he came home weeping, his hands all bloody from working in the factory. His mother, your great grandmother, wiped away his tears and said, ‘Don’t cry, one day you’ll own that factory.’ And by the time he was 30, he did.”<n>Dinnertime recaps of daily events also permit today’s children, isolated from the adult world of real work, to gain access to their parents’ daily lives. I learned much about my father’s experiences as a retail merchant through stories he related to my mother at dinnertime: “Soﬁe, you’ll never believe the customer who came into the store today. She complained so vehemently about a perfectly correct bill that it took two of us to escort her to the door.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt

In the past, extended family members or adults in the neighborhood more readily stepped in when parents, for one reason or another, could not invest enough time in their children’s lives. Today, neighborhood experiences are much more restricted. Housing enclaves where families know each other well and interested adults are available to “mind children’s business” are rare. Children who live close to their grandparents beneﬁt greatly, enjoying aectionate, playful relationships with them at early ages and looking to them for information, role models, family history, and values later on. But greater family mobility means that more children live a considerable distance from grandparents and other relatives. And parental divorce, which will aect 50 to 60 percent of American children born in the current decade,121 lessens contact with the noncustodial parent’s extended family. In childhood, physical distance makes for a psychologically distant relationship.<n>Remove parents and other adults from active participation in the lives of young children, and the vacuum may be ﬁlled by unsupervised and ill-behaved peers and the moral vagaries of American TV fare. Continued disengagement of adults from children’s lives, Bronfenbrenner prophesied, will result in greater alienation, indierence, antagonism, and violence on the part of young people from all sectors of society—a prediction that came to pass in the form of rapidly escalating youth crime between the 1970s and 1990s, with an increasing number of oenders from privileged homes.122<n>As media analysts try to make sense of the most heinous of these acts, including the recent spate of family, school, and neighborhood murders and maimings, parental retreat from a troubled child’s life almost invariably surfaces as a contributing factor. Parents of these youngsters often appear to be good people, having provided their children with material comforts and having responded with anguish, remorse, and attempts to do the right thing in the face of their child’s previous and current grievous behavior. But the cases suggest that stepping in only in at times of crisis cannot compensate for providing the ongoing togetherness and haven of a family. Such togetherness aects a child’s development in countless ways, even through what appear to be triﬂing pursuits—help with homework; outings to the grocery store, the park, and the local library; dinnertime conversations; discussions of exciting or scary TV shows; and bedtime stories. Yet these are the key experiences of childhood, through which children appropriate mental tools from more capable and discerning social partners, become enculturated and, thereby, human—intelligent, responsible, and caring.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt

In fact, an adult who breaks a rule in make-believe usually brings preschoolers’ profound respect for social order into bold relief! Cara, a demanding but spirited 5-year-old, likes to initiate make-believe with the following transparent role reversal: “Mom, I’ll be the mother, and you be my child 5 years old.” Cara’s mother plays along for a while and then deliberately transgresses, refusing to eat her vegetables or pick up her toys. At the ﬁrst sign of misbehavior, Cara lectures in a tone of voice well beyond her years: “Children must obey their parents because their parents know things they don’t, so the parents must take care of them.” As Cara’s pronouncement makes clear, play creates a “zone” through which preschoolers internalize a basic sense of social responsibility and morality. At the same time, they acquire a wealth of practical knowledge and skills.<n>In extreme circumstances, when the organization and predictability of the real world fall apart, young children whose prior lives have been ﬁlled with parental warmth and involvement often call on rules and rituals in make-believe to restore their social world. Recently, I came across the recollections of Alice Cahana, an elderly Holocaust survivor, recounting her days as a child in the death camp at Auschwitz. Alice explained that she and her sister Edith managed despite all odds to stay together. Their secret strategy was never to display any emotion that would give away their relationship, since a major objective of the SS was to break up families. Only at night did they dare to hug, whisper, and play together.<n>On Friday nights, they marked the Sabbath in a special way, by imagining that they were at home. They talked about the evening’s events in minute detail to make the image of family life ﬁrm and real. Alice had always had the responsibility of setting the table, and her mother would correct her if she left out even small, nonessential items. In play, Edith would murmur, “Alice, it’s time to set the table. Find the nicest tablecloths, and don’t forget the ﬂowers. Where are the napkins for the guests? You forgot the fork for Father. You really shined the candelabra beautifully this week, better than before.” 16 After their pretend meal, the two sisters would whisper songs.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
For example, biographical accounts of physicist Marie Curie, co-discoverer of radium and twice winner of the Nobel Prize, invariably make reference to her father’s untiring efforts to provide his children with ideas and games to ﬁll their spare time.52 A chest of colored blocks had special meaning. Marie and her older siblings used the blocks to represent cities, mountains, rivers, countries, and continents. Their father, a high school science teacher, often joined in, capitalizing on play as a way to teach geography. In the home in which Marie Curie grew up, one biographer summed up, “play was learning and learning was play.”53<n>In poet Sylvia Plath’s childhood, stories and storytelling were pervasive. As a 2 1/2-year-old, Sylvia was intensely jealous of her sickly younger brother for consuming so much of her mother’s attention. While the baby nursed, Sylvia sat nearby on the ﬂoor, impatient and unhappy. Her mother discovered that she could defuse Sylvia’s envy with a game in which Sylvia spread out the newspaper before her, picked out all the capital letters on the page, and pretended, in a very grown-up way, to read—an achievement that attracted much parental admiration. Sylvia’s mother often made up bedtime tales, serialized from one evening to the next. Almost as soon as they could talk, Sylvia and her brother responded in kind with limericks, poems, and fantastic stories of their own. On walks to their grandparents’ house and on long car trips, favorite books invariably came along, offering ready inspiration for the children’s imaginative creations.54<n>Filmstar Charlie Chaplin’s mother was herself a talented comedy actress and singer. As a young child, Charlie often accompanied her when she went to work at the theater. As a result, playacting and impersonating became an early focus of Charlie’s pretending. One evening during a performance, his mother’s voice failed. In a pinch, the stage manager, who had seen Charlie at play, led the little boy onstage in her place. Charlie continued his playacting unabated, which included songs, dances, and impersonations from his mother’s repertoire. He was demonstrating the wares of his ﬁrst and best teacher in the art of make-believe, and the performance evoked a roar of appreciation and a shower of coins from the crowd.55<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
An important point to note is that many contemporary toys undermine imagination and self-regulation. Aggressive toys are the most worrisome. Preschoolers who transform a stick or block into a weapon are doing little more than exploring a pervasive aspect of their culture. But equipping children with realistic-looking guns, swords, shields, and other tools of warfare is tantamount to setting up a training ground in aggression. Such toys foster both pretend and real hostility among peers.90 Boys’ penchant for high activity, excitement, and risk taking and their view of weaponry as the ultimate in masculinity attract them to war toys. Furthermore, when boys play with action ﬁgures modeled on violent TV and movie characters, such as Power Rangers, Transformers, and X-Men, their play narrows to mimicking the characters’ televised behavior and is generally aggressive and stereotyped. Video games with violent plots in which children advance by shooting and evading the enemy are yet another fantasy pursuit that largely appeals to boys. A growing number of studies conﬁrm that heavy playing of such games duplicates the effects of violent TV by promoting aggression and desensitizing children to violence.91 Furthermore, video games, even more than TV, are riddled with ethnic and gender stereotypes.92<n>In watching what happens once fast-action video games have entered their households, many parents express another concern—that their children will become addicted to these violent amusements. About 5 percent, usually boys, develop into “passionate,” or excessive, players during the elementary school years and desperately need parental intervention.93 Compared to infrequent users, children highly involved in video games spend less time productively, more often watching cartoons and less often reading.94 One parent whose son, Joey, spent his early childhood focused on play with Transformers and his school years immersed in video games complained about the boy’s mediocre grades and lamented, “Nothing seems to interest him.” Joey spent so much time with highly stimulating video games that he came to regard slower-paced pursuits that require greater initiative to reach a goal as dull.<n>Of course, preschoolers—even those as young as age 3—beneﬁt from experience with computers as long as activities are constructive, adults are available to support them, and children are not diverted from other worthwhile activities. But in homes in which family members are preoccupied with the computer, especially the Internet, time spent communicating and enjoying joint leisure activities declines.95 Therefore, the computer’s value for acquiring new skills and information must be weighed against its potential for detracting from adult–child dialogues and other family activities.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Finally, looking for the “silver lining” in the child’s difficult disposition can help parents muster the fortitude needed to rear a child with a difficult disposition. Consider Carl, one of the most obstinate participants in a study of the combined impact that temperament and child rearing have on long-term development.28 Beginning in infancy, Carl rejected many routines and experiences, including baths, bedtime, and new foods. He shrieked, cried, and struggled to get away. Yet his parents regarded his emotional intensity as a sign of inner strength and vigor. They believed that if they were patient and ﬁrmly insistent, Carl would, in the end, adapt positively.<n>By the time Carl reached school age, he was doing remarkably well. The energies he had previously invested in stubborn rebellion were channeled constructively. He did well in school and became enthusiastically involved in several activities. One of these was playing the piano—lessons that he had asked for but (in his typical fashion) at ﬁrst disliked intensely. Carl’s mother had granted his request for piano instruction under one condition: that he stick to the lessons for six months. She held him to this agreement despite his protests, which gradually subsided. Carl came to love his introduction to music. His parents’ warmth, determination, and consistency had helped him gain control of his behavior and beneﬁt from new learning opportunities.<n>How can you get an inactive child who loves quiet play to be more active and sociable?<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
La Adelita (Mexican Revolution Woman Soldier)<n>A feminist symbol of the Mexican Revolution, La Adelita was the name of a woman soldier, a soldadera, who followed the troops, helped to set up camp, and cooked for the soldiers. Some soldaderas were employed to cook and fulfil the needs of a particular soldier, whereas others were relatives or lovers. The legend states that Adelita was a woman who fought in the Revolution, but it is not known if she actually existed as an individual; she came to epitomize all soldaderas and courageous women of that period. In popular culture, literature, and the cinema, soldaderas have been portrayed as self-sacrificing women, usually mestizas (mixed-race women) from the lower classes, but La Adelita is often seen as a güera (light-skinned), “sweetheart of the troops, a woman who is valiant, pretty, and a wonderful helpmate to the soldier” (Salas 121). Several corridos (ballads) have been written about her, and she is a powerful symbol for Mexican and Chicana women, representing bravery, self-discipline, and romantic love. In fact, it is primarily through the corridos that Adelita is known today. Historically, all soldaderas became known as Adelitas. In performances by ballet folklórico groups, the dances and music of the Revolution are often called Las Adelitas.<n>La Adelita is more than a romantic image to modern-day Chicanas. She continues to symbolize feminine independence, integrity, the fight for justice, and a proud heritage. Because the major influx of Mexican immigration into the United States was during the Mexican Revolution, many Chicanos and Chicanas grew up hearing stories about soldaderas and La Adelita from relatives, parents, and grandparents. In the late 1960s Chicanas who joined the Brown Berets de Aztlán, a political pseudomilitary youth group, often dressed as Adelitas, wearing rebozos (shawls) and bandoliers crisscrossed over their chests.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt
Mexican workers recruited from Mexico under the Emergency Farm Labor Program known as the Bracero Program, which was in effect from 1942 to 1964. The word bracero comes from the Spanish word brazo (arm), which is used, as English uses “hand,” to mean “laborer.” In the same way bracero commonly means a man who works with his hands, a laborer, and is used when speaking of all farm and agricultural workers. There was a shortage of farm laborers during World War II, and this program offered an answer to that problem, although some braceros also worked on the railroad. Until only recently bracero was applied to any Mexican farmworker, and is often used interchangeably with words like “wetback” or “greaser.” The number of workers brought from Mexico ranged from a low of 4,180 in 1942 to a high of 62,091 in 1944. It is estimated that by 1947 nearly 220,000 braceros had worked in the United States under this program. It continued even after the war, and between 1955 and 1959 over 480,000 braceros were still working in the United States. Some have compared the Bracero Program with legalized slavery, and the impact on the perception of the Mexican farmworker by American agribusiness has been to foster contempt and disdain. Many braceros chose not to return to Mexico when their contracts ended and -instead stayed and hid from la migra, the feared Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).<n>Many Chicanos of the Southwest and Midwest are descendants of braceros who came to the United States and stayed, never returning to Mexico. The bracero experience has been written about in novels and depicted in numerous movies, and although the image presented is often a negative one, like other Chicano folk heroes the bracero has become an archetype of the culture. He is in the company of the historical mestizo character of Yo soy Joaquín, the revolutionary figure of Joaquín Murrieta, the mythical pachuco, the stately learned persona of Dr. Paredes, the gentle leadership of César Chávez; the bracero is the universally exploited farmworker, the campesino of the world. Many corridos (ballads) describe the experience of coming to work in the agricultural fields of the Midwest and the Southwest. Maria Herrera-Sobek -describes the prototype of the bracero, as represented in countless corridos, in her book The Bracero Experience. In Mexico the experience was written about from the perspective of those who returned, as in such books as Aventuras de un Bracero, by Jesus Amaya Topete, published in 1949 and reprinted several times, and in the United States the novel Macho! by Edmund Villaseñor, published in 1973.<n>References Acuña 1988; Galarza 1964; Gutiérrez 1995; Herrera-Sobek 1979, 1993b, 1998; Madrid-Barela 1975; Nelson 1971; Paredes 1993<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
Burritos<n>Literally a little burro or little donkey, a burrito has come to mean a taco made of a wheat flour tortilla instead of a corn tortilla, filled with meat, rice, frijoles (beans), and chile, then folded and rolled up. There are several theories about the origins of the name burrito, and there may be some truth to all of them. One theory is that when flour tortillas became available in northern Mexico, tacos de frijoles, or bean burritos, were easy to carry in the saddle-bags of the vaqueros (cowboys), so for this reason they came to be called burritos as though they were the sidekicks of the vaquero’s horse.<n>Tacos made from corn tortillas are much older; they have been around since the epoch of the Aztecs. Wheat and flour were introduced into New Spain by the Spaniards, and one can see that the flour tortilla is similar to the flat bread found in many Mediterranean countries. Once flour tortillas were discovered, the move to making tacos from flour tortillas was logical. Since corn tortillas are small, and can only bend or fold over once, and flour tortillas are more pliable and can be rolled several times, the flour taco was a natural outcome. A burrito can be made with any type of filling, such as beans, potatoes, chile con carne, chile colorado, carnitas (chile with meat, red chile, roasted pork meat), or even peanut butter.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt

Since at least the 1920s, Chicanos from Texas have been making what came to be called burritos. Originally they were called tacos; another story about the origin of the name is that in the 1940s there was an establishment in Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, called Los Burritos that sold tacos made of tortillas de harina (flour tortillas). It became a well-known place to go, and people spoke of going a los burritos (to the burritos) when they wanted tacos of that kind. Commercial burritos became available in San Francisco in 1961, according to an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, and now there are supposedly over 150 burrito taquerías (taco restaurants) in the Mission District of that city. Burros is the name reserved for the very large tortilla burritos, in which the tortilla may be a foot and a half to two feet in diameter.<n>See also Tacos<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
Cabeza de Baca, Fabiola (1894–1991)<n>Born in northern New Mexico on May 16, 1894 (although some sources give her birth date as 1898), Fabiola Cabeza de Baca became a famous home economist, teacher, folklorist, and writer. She was one of several New Mexican women, such as Cleofas M. Jaramillo and Nina Otero-Warren, who wrote of the culture and heritage of their Hispano ancestors. Her parents came from long-established Hispano families who had been in New Mexico for over 200 years. Her grandparents raised her from the age of four, after her mother died, leaving Fabiola with one brother and two sisters. She attended the Loretto Academy in Las Vegas and after graduating from high school became a teacher in a rural area six miles from her father’s ranch in La Liendre. In 1921 she received a B.A. degree from New Mexico Normal (now New Mexico Highlands University) and in 1929 a B.S. in home economics from New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (now New Mexico State University). In between she also spent one year studying in Spain.<n>For over thirty years she worked as an extension agent, teaching the traditional ways of preparing foods and emphasizing the nutritional value in the native diet. Two of her books, Historic Cookery and The Good Life, depict the way of life of the Hispanos in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In We Fed Them Cactus she presents a biography and ethnography of her family, especially her grandmother, a strong woman and a curandera, and retells the stories narrated to her by her father. She depicts the arrival of the Hispano pioneers on the llano (plains) of western New Mexico in the 1830s, and also that of the Anglos in the 1880s, the loss of land, the fencing-in of the plains, and the end of the era with the death of her father. The title of the book refers to the custom in New Mexico of feeding cattle cactus to keep them alive during droughts. In The Good Life, not a long book, Cabeza de Baca creates a fictional family, the Turrietas, and uses their story to narrate the rituals, customs, food, and culture of New Mexico. The customs of Christmas, Lent, marriage, and a funeral are presented, along with many recipes of the foods prepared for these celebrations. She wrote many articles for various New Mexican publications. In 1959 she retired but continued to work giving lectures, writing, and acting as a consultant to the Peace Corps. She died at the age of ninety-seven on October 14, 1991.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chC.txt
California Folklore<n>The settlement of California by Spanish colonizers happened much later than in New Mexico and Texas. The first Franciscan mission was established in San Diego in 1769, 200 years after the exploration of New Mexico. A second great difference was that many of the Spanish settlers came by way of Mexico, so many of them represented a mestizo (mixed-race) culture rather than a purely sixteenth-century Spanish culture, as the earlier explorers had. Many were Mexican Spaniards and of course did not bring the Spanish language and culture of the Golden Age of Spain with them. Their Spanish language and culture had evolved into a slightly New World variant.<n>The population of California did not grow much during the eighteenth century, and after the independence of Mexico from Spain in 1821, Spanish culture quickly declined in the region. Many Spaniards left the region, and the great migration of thousands of Anglo American gold seekers took place, so the Spanish culture and language could not survive in California as it did in Texas and New Mexico. By 1880 the Mexican, or Californio, inhabitants of the state represented 1 percent of the total population. At the turn of the century the Chicano population in Los Angeles was only 5 percent. It wasn’t until 1910, with the beginnings of a revolution in Mexico, that the first large wave of Mexican immigration was felt in California.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chC.txt
The word matachines can translate to mean “clowning” or “trickery,” but can also mean “puppet player,” “jester,” and “buffoon.” Matachines refers to the men who dance as a group; the group is composed usually of twelve men, but can have from ten to fourteen. In sixteenth-century Europe a matachin was a masked dancer, an entertainer who danced with a sword. It is likely that the Moors transplanted the dance to Europe and that matachin may come from the Arabic word mutawajjihin, meaning “to assume a mask.” There are many eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary references to a matachine sword dance, indicating that such a dance was performed in Europe.<n>Similar to the dance-drama of Los Moros y Cristianos, the dance of Los Matachines was taught to the subjugated Indians by the Spanish missionaries as a custom to celebrate on Christian feast days but also as a means of converting them to Catholicism. Flavia Waters Champe’s interpretation is that the dance was brought to New Mexico by Spanish and Mexican settlers who came with De Vargas at the time of the second conquest in 1692.<n>In New Mexico the dance group is open only to men and it is considered an honor to be a part of it. The masked men, with decorated headdresses, dance in two parallel rows, in bright costumes decorated with long ribbons that appear to be a combination of Aztec and southwest Indian in origin. The main characters in the drama are El Monarca, the King, who represents Montezuma, and four Capitanes. The swords referred to earlier have become three-pronged palmas (palms) in the New World. In the performances of some groups there is a queen, La Reina, but in others she might be called La Malinche, the Indian woman who became the mistress of Cortés, who represents innocence or the Church. La Reina is often a little girl dressed in a white dress. In some locations it is believed the dancers represent the Twelve Apostles, but in others they are just ordinary men. They carry an image of the Madonna and move along in a candle-lit procession. One and sometimes two prominent performers are El Abuelo (the grandfather) and La Abuela (the grandmother), who act as leaders and also as clowns throughout the dance. El Abuelo wears a rubber mask, and is dressed somewhat like a white man, sometimes carrying a whip, and directing the rest of the dancers. He calls out songs and dance instructions and cracks his whip against the ground. Another dancer, sometimes a small boy, will represent El Toro (the bull), who initiates a bullfight with El Abuelo and is slain. This side battle symbolizes the battle between good and evil. The music is usually played with nonindigenous instruments like the violin and guitar. The costumes and masks of the dance are very important and are usually made by the dancers themselves or their families.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
Lo Mexicano<n>An expression and concept that came into usage in Mexico around 1900, but was not completely culturally defined until after the Mexican Revolution in the late 1920s. The concept had to do with Mexican nationalism and a sense of self-identity with a Mexican consciousness. The term conceptualized a new identity and an awareness of Mexicanness that was native, drawing on the indigenous and the mestizaje (mixed-race nature) of the country. It was in the 1920s when the term lo Mexicano became more known in association with nationalism and could be seen in the life of Mexico and in the art and literature produced after the Revolution. Even in the United States, the art of Mexican painters, such as Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, was admired and well received because of its Mexican character. The writings and research of the Mexican philosopher Samuel Ramos brought attention to the national character of the Mexicano, and to a definition of Mexican identity. Lo Mexicano referred to the Mexicanidad, the national character of the Mexican, which was mestizo (mixed-race) and not European.<n>This essence called lo Mexicano can be found in art, literature, music, and folklore, for it encompasses the whole experience of being culturally Mexican. The lore of Mexicanidad has migrated to the United States from Mexico with the waves of immigration in the last 100 years, and lo Mexicano forms part of the identity of all Chicanos. Américo Paredes’s life work was an attempt to understand lo Mexicano of the Chicano experience through folklore, in the text of narratives and in the context of folk performances.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
Joaquín Murrieta’s life has been depicted in novels, stories, newspaper serials, and movies. Charles E. B. Howe wrote a play about Joaquín in 1859 that covers his escapades from the spring of 1851 to July 24, 1853, the day he was captured and killed by Captain Harry Love. It is not known if the play was ever performed, but the portrayal of Murrieta is moving and especially interesting because of all the negative publicity following his capture and death. Howe portrays him as an aristocratic intelligent leader and a man who commits crimes to avenge the wrongs committed against himself and his countrymen.<n>Joseph Henry Jackson’s work traces the history of the legend, claiming all the information came from the John Rollin Ridge version and that he should be credited with starting the “fictitious” legend. Although Jackson does quote from the San Francisco Alta newspaper demonstrating that many people suspected it was not Joaquín Murrieta who was killed and decapitated by Captain Harry Love, but quite possibly another Joaquín, “every murder and robbery in the country has been attributed to ‘Joaquín.’ Sometimes it is Joaquín Carrillo that has committed all these crimes; then it is Joaquín Murrieta, then Joaquín something else, but always Joaquín!” (Jackson, 13).<n>Marcus Stewart wrote a long epic poem in 1882 titled Rosita, A California Tale, in which he speculates on the life of Murrieta. In this poem, Joaquín lives and flees in a ship to Mexico or South America, and the body that is decapitated is actually that of his good friend Ramón. Ramón’s girlfriend, Rosita, also disappears at the time of his death, and only after her death, thirty years later, is it revealed that she had been living the life of a man. This story is commingled with the story of Charlotte (Charlie) Parkhurst who lived as a man in California during the latter half of the nineteenth century. The Murrieta legend has also been written by Latinos and Europeans, and Pablo Neruda, the Nobel Prize winner, wrote an opera about Murrieta entitled Splendor and Death of Joaquín Murrieta, insisting that Joaquín was actually Chileno and not Mexican.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
Of all the areas of the Southwest where Chicanos have settled and lived, it is New Mexico’s culture and folklore that has been historically studied the most. Aurelio M. Espinosa was the first Hispano (a person of Spanish heritage born in New Mexico) to conduct research into the culture and language of New Mexicans. His most important work was published during the early part of the nineteenth century, 1910–1916, with a series of publications in the Journal of American Folklore. He collected folktales, folk songs, proverbs, superstitions, riddles, children’s games, and much more. Students who were trained by Espinosa and who later continued folkloric work in New Mexico were Arthur Campa, Juan B. Rael, and Espinosa’s son, Jose Manuel Espinosa, who published Spanish Folk-tales from New Mexico in 1937. Rael published Cuentos Españoles de Colorado y Nuevo Mejico in 1957, which is considered by Américo Paredes to be one of the best collections of Mexican folk narrative. Campa’s work includes collections of folk poetry, riddles, folk songs, and folk drama from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, published mostly in the 1940s and 1950s.<n>John Donald Robb (1892–1989) collected folk songs throughout New Mexico in the 1940s and 1950s using wire recorders. He came to the University of New Mexico as chair of the music department in 1941. He was a composer and educator but always had an interest in folk music. The John Donald Robb Archive of Southwestern Music is located at the university’s library. His two books on New Mexico are Hispanic Folk Songs of New Mexico (1954) and Hispanic Folk Music of New Mexico and the Southwest: A Self Portrait of a People (1980).<n>Hispanic women have always been involved in creative and artistic work in New Mexico even up until contemporary times. Although there have been many publications about the santeros (saint makers), wood-carvers, tinsmiths, and other male artists, very little has been written about the work accomplished by women. Women have created religious folk art, such as santos (saints), retablos (religious paintings), straw appliqué crosses, and tinwork. Women wove blankets and embroidered colchas (blankets). Whitewashing and plastering of homes have always been women’s work. Those who do it are called enjarradoras, and today they continue this work, also making adobe hornos (ovens) and fireplaces for the International Museum of Folk Art located in Santa Fe. Marianne Stoller writes of the work of New Mexican women artists and why they have been left out of history.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chN.txt

Marianne Stoller writes of the work of New Mexican women artists and why they have been left out of history.<n>Several New Mexican women who descended from the early Spanish settlers of the region wrote personal life histories that incorporated the traditional way of life of the Hispano community of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Fabiola Cabeza de Baca, Nina Otero-Warren, and Cleofas Jaramillo each produced several books that present the folklore, rituals, and customs of the New Mexicans. Rebolledo discusses how these women used their writings as “narrative strategies of resistance” because they saw their culture and way of life slowly eroding away and being assimilated by a dominant and foreign culture. Because they all came from upper-class families, they were educated in Spanish traditions and language and consequently ignored the mestizo (mixed-race) and indigenous aspects of the culture, often depicting their past in romantic pastoral terms. Nevertheless, they all wrote of the loss of land and loss of culture, and sought to preserve the folklore, customs, and stories of their grandparents, close friends, and those who worked for them.<n>The Penitentes, the ancient religious brotherhood, have attracted much research and been scrutinized by many writers and journalists. De Cordova, Henderson, Sprott, and Weigle have conducted the most perceptive and sensitive writing on the Penitentes. The popular arts of colonial New Mexico, particularly the santos and santeros, have received a lot of attention by such researchers as E. Boyd, Marta Weigle, and William Wroth.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chN.txt
The chant states that they’re angels from heaven and are asking for gifts, although if they receive none, they may break doors and windows. The origin of this custom is not known, but some believe it is to remind society that the stranger at the door should not be forgotten. Lorin Brown reports that in northern New Mexico the children went out on Christmas Eve, but in Canutillo, Texas, around the 1920s, it was the custom for children to go door to door on Christmas Day, although they didn’t recite the above chant. The neighbors expected them and were ready with gifts of fruits and candies.<n>Lottie C. Devine makes reference to the Papago Indians in Arizona, saying that on “Christmas Day most of them came to town, all dressed in party clothes, and went from house to house ‘calling Christmas.’ Everyone gave them candies and apples and many of them in turn gave baskets or pottery” (29). Cabeza de Baca refers to this custom as aguinaldos, and the chant she records is similar to the one above, except that the last line is “A pedir Aguinaldos y Oremos.” Aguinaldos are gifts given during the Christmas season.<n>See also Aguinaldos<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chO.txt
Pachucos (-as) (1940s Urban Youth)<n>A name adopted by Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals to designate those who make up a fascinating urban subculture, detached from U.S. culture and from Mexican American urban life also. The first appearance of pachucos was in the El Paso–Juárez area during the 1920s and early 1930s. It is thought the word pachuco was a colloquial way of referring to El Paso. A person from El Paso was referred to as del pachuco. Sometimes a person considered a pachuco was called a chuco. Haldeen Braddy discusses the origin of the word pachuco, providing several theories. One is that the pachucos of the 1930s came from the city of Pachuca in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. He also pre-sents the definition from the Diccionario General de Americanismos, stating that pachuca is a five-card poker hand in which all the cards are of different suits, or in other words, a poker hand with no value, a losing hand. Braddy believes this well describes the pachucos of El Paso (1971). The other theory is that pachuco comes from the Nahuatl word pachtli, which refers to a grass like hay that grows parasitically on trees.<n>Pachucos were identifiable by their clothing, hairstyles, and a distinct language with its own vocabulary. The men wore “zoot suits,” that is, pegged pants, long coats with padded shoulders, and pancake hats. Their hair was worn long and slicked back with a ducktail effect. Some also wore a long chain hanging from their pants, well displayed and connected to a belt. Pachucas were the girlfriends of the pachucos, but they also had a dress style all their own. They wore short, very tight skirts, with their hair high and long. Makeup was heavy, especially around the eyes. Supposedly they were very streetwise and liked to hang out with their pachuco boyfriends.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt
Large numbers of young men from El Paso, speaking the pachuco argot, settled in Los Angeles during the early 1940s, and it was there that they became recognized as an identifiable group, and considered to be gang members. Young men who relocated and settled in Los Angeles, even for short periods of time, upon returning home to the small towns of the Southwest, would spread the pachuco beliefs and jargon to their communities. In this way pachuquesmo, a Mexican subculture, became known throughout the Southwest.<n>The pachuco speech, a combination of English and Spanish, also called caló, was a fascinating fusion drawing from many linguistic sources. Caló was originally the language of the Spanish gypsies, or a dialect of Spanish showing traces of many languages acquired by the gypsies throughout their world wanderings. The pachuco argot utilized several linguistic sources in developing a vocabulary or jargon. These sources were southwestern Spanish, the older archaic Spanish from New Mexico, Mexican slang, standard Spanish from Mexico City, and also words invented by the pachucos themselves. The pachuco dialect was the product of an urban environment, and it is believed the language may have originated in the underworld and drug scene of El Paso. George Carpenter Barker pinpoints almost exactly where the pachuco jargon originated, from the 7-X gang who first met in the neighborhood of Florence and Eighth Streets in El Paso. Arthur Campa believes that pachucos originated as a linguistic group first and had no distinctive dress style. That came later as they moved into a more stable economic environment and had some financial resources.<n>Expressions and vocabulary used by Chicanos today come from the pachuco argot of the 1940s. For example, such words as órale (what’s happening, or O.K.), bato (guy, as in bato loco), califas (California), hay te wuacho (I’ll be seeing you), and la pinta (jail/prison) have been used for generations. The film Zoot Suit, written and directed by Luis Valdez in 1981, depicts the dress, language, and problems of Mexican American youth and especially pachucos in Los Angeles in the 1940s.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt
Pochismos (Americanisms)<n>A term that describes the use of English expressions in Spanish, or Americanisms interjected into conversations when speaking Spanish. Sometimes this kind of speech is called Spanglish, or Chicano Spanish, or just pocho talk. Examples of some pochismos are words such as parkear, meaning to park (the car), and wachar, meaning to watch (hay te wacho, “I’ll see you”), also spelled guachate, meaning “watch out.” Other simpler examples are dona for doughnut, el dompe for the dump, troque for truck, and yarda for yard. According to Manuel Peña the word jaitón, meaning “snobbish,” evolved from the words “high tone” when one was discussing music. It came to be used to mean pretentious high class, as in “se crea muy jaitona” (she thinks she’s real high-class), but at the same time it can mean that one has elegance or style.<n>Various dictionaries of Chicano Spanish and Chicano slang have been compiled that list many other pochismos. Chicano novelists and poets have consciously incorporated the use of pochismos in literary works to reinforce the precarious cultural and linguistic status of Chicanos in American society.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt
Quinto Sol (Fifth Sun)<n>The narrative of the Fifth Sun is based on an Aztec myth that has become an important cultural expression commonly incorporated into Chicano cultural events. The first publisher of contemporary Chicano literature in the 1960s, based in Berkeley, California, was named Quinto Sol Publications. Worship of the sun was an integral part of Aztec culture. The sun was viewed as a warrior with the solar rays as his darts. Time consisted of a fifty-two-year calendar that was divided into five ages, or series of ages, called Suns. The first age was the Age of the Earth Sun, and the god was Tezcatlipoca, whose familiar animal was the jaguar. The second age was the Age of Great Winds, the sun was Quetzalcoatl, and the age ended with great hurricanes. Then came the Age of Fire with the sun Tlaloc, and it ended with volcanic eruptions. Next was the Age of Floods with the goddess of waters, Chalchiuhtlicue, as the fourth sun. This age ended when the sky fell upon the earth and the waters gushed up, turning men into fish. The present and fifth age, El Quinto Sol, has Nanahuatl, also known as Tonatiuh, as the god, and it is the Age of Earthquakes. With El Quinto Sol a full culture was created, with maize grown for the first time, fire domesticated, and the creation of the Toltecs. This age is supposed to end with earthquakes. Each age came about when the god of an aeon died or sacrificed himself to be reborn as the sun of the next aeon.<n>References Bierhorst 1990; Brundage 1979; Florescano 1999; Griffith 1990<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chQ.txt
It is accepted that the word ranchera refers to a type of Mexican song, although sometimes it is an adjective that describes a character or a type of person. Ranchera comes from the word rancho, meaning a “cattle ranch, farm, or rural settlement.” A poor unsophisticated person may be called a ranchero or ranchera, implying he or she is from the countryside, the sticks, and a hick. In the context of Mexican folk music la canción ranchera is a love song, sung by the common folk, the peasants of the rural countryside. After the Mexican Revolution rancheras became more agreeable to the upper classes because of the movement toward a Mexican identity and nationalism and a rejection of European cultural values. The modern canción ranchera was made popular in Mexico City in the early 1950s by the songwriter José Alfredo Jimenez. The poetic structure of the ranchera is brief and simple, yet emotionally it is very intense. According to Rubén Campos as quoted by Gradante, “it is a moan and a sigh . . . , the briefest form of composition and, as such, requires a greater intensity of expression than any other compositional form. It must say precisely what it means” (1983, 105). The themes of rancheras are love and unrequited love, but from the point of view of the ordinary common man. Rancheras express the poetry of the masses. The famous ranchera singer Amalia Mendoza states, “the canción ranchera expresses the sensibility of the masses and reaches them: thus, its popularity. . . . One might say that the canción ranchera reflects the personality of the masses because it expresses something vital that we all have in common” (Gradante 1983, 105).<n>The ranchera originated in Mexico but is very popular in the United States among Mexicans and Chicanos. José Alfredo Jimenez wrote over 500 songs, many becoming classics that continue to be sung today by younger artists, that have a universal sentiment that speaks to the hearts of Chicanos. Because of the style of these romantic songs, sung to Mariachi music and sung in Spanish, untranslatable rancheras express the epitome of Mexicanness. The musical poetics arouse emotional sentiments about lost loves, nostalgia, and by extension about being Mexican. Songs such as “Ella” (Her), “Camino de Guanajuato” (Road to Guanajuato), “La Vida no Vale Nada” (Life Has No Value), and “Llego Borracho el Borracho” (The Drunk Arrived Drunk) all elicit memories of fathers, grandfathers, and stories of Mexico. Many are drinking songs, frequently shown in movies being sung in cantinas (bars), but they are also dancing songs, so they are played at celebrations and family gatherings. Although rancheras are intensely male centered, there are several female singers who became famous singing rancheras, such as Lola Beltran, Lucha Villa, and Amalia Mendoza. The performance of rancheras is always dramatic and emotional, whether performed by men or women, and the audience can always empathize with the situations depicted in the verses. The life experiences portrayed in the songs of José Alfredo Jimenez, who came from a poverty-stricken background himself, are about the struggles of Everyman, the need for social acceptance, personal happiness, and some type of financial security. These are concerns that the average Mexicano and Chicano can identify with. Although most rancheras speak of love, other life situations found in the songs deal with fortune, destiny, and life’s choices. In “Camino de Guanajuato,” these existential words open the song:<n>No vale nada la vida,<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chR.txt
Rio Grande Blankets<n>A Rio Grande blanket was a blanket woven in New Mexico during the nineteenth century that was meant to be worn during the day and used as bedding at night. Blankets were woven before this period, actually since the seventeenth century, but not many survived from the period of 1600 to 1800. The Rio Grande blanket has particular characteristics, with designs that include wide bands and various zones of narrow stripes. During the early 1800s the wool was not dyed and was left in colors of brown and white. It was called churro (a kind of sheep) wool, because it came from the common sheep introduced by the Spaniards. Later, the wool was combined with natural dyed yarns of indigo. This wool was woven on a narrow treadle loom. The designs for the Rio Grande blankets are very distinct, with indigo-dyed stripes, and later were influenced by Saltillo sarape motifs that were introduced in the late 1800s. There was much borrowing and exchange of materials, fibers, and dyes between the Pueblo Indians and the Spanish in the textile weaves of New Mexico. The Saltillo sarape motif has a large complex diamond in the central layout of the blanket, and sometimes is surrounded by a scalloped border. Rio Grande blankets from the late nineteenth century incorporated many of the Saltillo sarape motifs. Today, reproductions of the Rio Grande blankets can be found on stationery, cards, and other types of artwork.<n>See also Sarape<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chR.txt
The early vaqueros, those of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, were mestizos, Indians, Negroes, and mulattos. When Anglo Americans moved into Texas and bought enormous tracts of land, they established huge ranches and hired Mexican vaqueros to work them. They recruited and moved whole families from Mexico to work and live on their ranches. The King and Kennedy ranches of east Texas are contemporary examples of this tradition and have many generations of Mexican vaqueros still living on their ranches. A social historical study of the vaquero life on the King and Kennedy ranches, from the early nineteenth century to the present, has been written by Monday and Colley.<n>The vaquero from California also worked on very large ranches, such as the Tejon ranch in the lower San Joaquin Valley. This way of life has been memorialized in the work of Arnold Rojas, who was a vaquero and has written about his life in California in the twentieth century. Rojas makes a distinction between the cowboy, the vaquero, and the buckaroo. The vaquero was originally Hispanic or Mexican, or Indian, and herded cattle in the Far West in the states of California, Nevada, Oregon, Arizona, Utah, and Washington, whereas the cowboys who herded cattle in the southern states were usually Negro or Anglo. The vaquero or buckaroo is a westerner and the cowboy is a southerner. The definition is a territorial one, with the cowboy working east of the Rockies and the vaquero west of the Rockies. It is this difference that Rojas writes about in his three-volume memoir of the California vaquero. Anglos coined the word buckaroo, meaning vaquero, because they disliked the word cowboy and did not want to call themselves by that name. Somehow when they pronounced vaquero, it came out of their mouths as “buckaroo.” The California Indians were trained by the Spanish missionaries to herd cattle, and they were the primary vaqueros until the mid-1800s. Mexicans from Sonora took over as vaqueros when they started migrating into California in the nineteenth century. The style of horse riding instituted by the Spaniards was called la jinete, a term that relates to the equipment used in riding. It not only includes the bits, spurs, and the saddles, but also the length of the stirrups, how the reins are held, and the amount of pressure of the knees on the horse. Rojas was born in California, as was his mother, who as a child had a pleasant encounter with the bandit Tiburcio Vásquez. He spent his whole life working as a vaquero and he states, “I speak as a vaquero—and I know whereof I speak” (Rojas, 1979, 119).<n>References Graham 1990, 1991, 1993; Mather 1992; Monday and Colley 1997; Rojas 1958, 1979; Verti 1990<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chV.txt
Vásquez, Tiburcio (1835–1875)<n>A legendary Chicano folk hero who roamed through California’s San Joaquin Valley during the late nineteenth century. He came from an old Californio family who owned extensive property and a large ranch. But he also lived during a time when Anglo Americans were becoming dominant in the state, when overt discrimination against Mexicans who were considered foreigners was on the rise, and he fell into a life of crime. Compared heroically to Joaquín Murrieta, Tiburcio Vásquez is regarded as a proud man who resisted social domination and fought to maintain and preserve his culture. He actually lived fairly long but was eventually captured, tried, and hanged at the age of forty.<n>He was born in Monterey County in 1835 or 1837, where he was raised and attended school, becoming fluent in both English and Spanish. His career of flight and lawlessness started in 1851 when, with several other men at a fandango, he witnessed or was involved in the death of a constable named Hardimount. Not expecting to be treated justly, he fled to the hills, and from then on, Vásquez led a life of horse stealing, robbery, and hiding out in the foothills of California. The legend states that he shared his stolen goods with the poor Mexicans of the Salinas Valley. He was well liked and depended on the local people to hide him from the posses that were continually after him. He was captured several times and actually spent almost nine years in San Quentin prison, on two different occasions, first in 1857, then again in 1867. After being released in January of 1870, Vásquez spent the next four years in a life of banditry but also one of romance. Women were attracted to him and he frequently fell in love, and he had a special weakness for married women. He claimed to have never killed a single person, and when he robbed people in stores and stagecoaches, he’d tie them up and lay them face up on the ground, a tactic he used often during this period. One source refers to his “hog-tied” captives. He was shot and survived several times but was finally caught in May of 1874. While awaiting trial in the San Jose jail, Vásquez appealed for funds for his defense. Thousands of people came to visit him in jail, bringing flowers, food, and other gifts. With the funds raised he was able to hire two well-qualified lawyers. Even so, he was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to death. He was publicly hanged on March 19, 1875, in San Jose, California.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chV.txt

Once, at a party or fandango, a woman hid him under her great hooped dress, where he crouched silently until the constable gave up his search of the premises. Another anecdote of narrow escape tells the tale of Vásquez being hidden in the bed, under the covers, of a newly birthed mother. His friends offered to hide him by letting him crawl under the covers at the foot of the bed while the mother showed off her newborn to the sheriff.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chV.txt
La Virgen de Guadalupe<n>Also commonly known as Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, she is the Virgin Mary who appeared to Juan Diego, a Mexican Christian Indian, on December 9, 1531. Historical documents verify the story of her apparitions. She identified herself as the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, and speaking in Nahuatl, she asked Juan Diego to go to the Spanish bishop and ask that a temple be built there where she appeared, the mount of Tepeyac. To Juan Diego she was a beautiful woman who spoke his language, so after much difficulty he sought to speak to the bishop, but his story was not heard, and he was asked to return another day. The beautiful woman appeared to Juan Diego a second time, and he was asked to seek the bishop’s audience again. On the second try Juan Diego saw the bishop, his story was heard and questioned, but was not believed. The bishop wanted a sign from the Great Lady so that he would know it was really she who was sending Juan Diego. Diego intended to go back to Tepeyac and inform the beautiful woman, but when he returned home he found that his uncle Juan Bernardino was extremely ill. The next morning, on December 12, as he walked to Tlatelolco to call a priest to come to his uncle’s side, the beautiful woman came to him a third time asking what was wrong. Diego told her of his sick uncle and of the request from the bishop. She told him his uncle was now well and would not die and sent him to the top of a hill to cut fresh flowers that he was to take to the bishop as proof of her existence. Diego followed her instructions and at the top of the hill he found beautiful roses of Castile, still covered with dew. He cut them and The Lady, the Mother of God, arranged them in his tilma (cloak) and sent him to the bishop, with the proof requested. When Diego unfolded his tilma in front of the bishop, the roses fell to the floor, and there on the tilma was an image of the Virgin Mary. Now the Spanish bishop believed, and as the beautiful woman requested, a church was built right on the mount of Tepeyac. The tilma with the image of the Virgin Mary still hangs in the temple called Guadalupe. The name that the beautiful Lady gave herself was Tlecuauhtlacupeuh, but to the Spaniards it sounded like Guadalupe, which they instantly recognized as “Our Lady of Guadalupe” from Estremadura, Spain. But the Aztecs understood that in the Nahuatl language the name Tlecuauhtlacupeuh meant “la que viene volando de la luz como el águila de fuego” (she who comes flying from the region of light like an eagle of fire).<n>Tonantzin was an Aztec goddess, literally called Our Holy Mother, also known as Tonan. Guadalupe appeared at what was once the temple of Tonantzin at the mount of Tepeyac. Even today in Mexico, La Virgen María is often called Tonantzin. The acceptance of La Virgen de Guadalupe by the indigenous population of Mexico was the beginning of Mexican Christianity and the conversion of the Aztecs to Catholicism. Guadalupe became the symbol of Indian Catholicism, different from the European Catholicism of the Spaniards. As the Aztecs adapted the Catholic religion to their indigenous beliefs, they created a religion that met their own needs and own way of life. She was declared the “Patroness of the Mexican Nation” in 1737, and in 1754 Pope Benedict XIV canonized Guadalupe as an official saint. She was crowned “Queen of Mexico” in 1895, showing how strong a symbol of Mexican nationalism she had become. Today she continues as the country’s strongest symbol of Mexican identity. The cathedral built in her honor can no longer be used because of structural damage, but a new one was built in the early 1970s. Masses are held every hour of the day and the church is constantly filled to capacity.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chV.txt
Chicano wedding rituals vary from state to state in the Southwest and the Midwest, often incorporating emerging American customs, but there are still common traditions that originate with Catholicism and the Spanish heritage that are shared from community to community. The Spanish word for a wedding is boda, meaning “nuptials,” and often Chicanos will call a wedding celebration La Boda. The southwestern region with the most researched and documented wedding customs is New Mexico, because the descendents of the early Hispanos have been conscious of describing and writing down their traditions. For instance Fabiola Cabeza de Baca, Cleofas Jaramillo, and Nina Otero all wrote about the weddings of northern New Mexico. In her book The Good Life, Fabiola Cabeza de Baca has a brief chapter on wedding traditions, including recipes and a detailed description of the preparation of the food.<n>When a couple married, three main ceremonies took place. These were initiated after the groom and his family had asked the girl’s family for her hand in marriage. If the girl or her family refused the offer, she would send a letter to her suitor with her negative response. This was termed as giving cala-bazas (squash or pumpkin) and was a great insult to the wooer. Of the ceremonies, first there was el día del prendorio (day of the engagement), when the bride and groom came together publicly for the first time. A great celebration would take place, usually in the home of the bride, with food, drinks, and music. This festivity would be equivalent to an engagement party. The day of the wedding was called el día del casorio and could last from two to three days. The upper classes held lavish wedding ceremonies that would last for days with lots of music and food for their many guests; the poorer folks also followed many of the same traditions, although in a more modest fashion. It was the tradition that the bridegroom’s family hosted the celebration after the church service. There was always an orchestra that played while the guests ate, and a big dance on the eve of the wedding day. After the dance, or at the conclusion of the feast, there was the entrega de novios (delivery of the wedding couple), when the wedding couple was formally returned to their parents and placed under their guidance. Songs from this ritual were collected by Juan Rael and reveal the solemnity of the ceremony.<n>The Hispano folklore does not specify the actual religious sacramental rituals, but more recent publications do describe church ceremonies that are still observed today. In very traditional weddings, the arras, thirteen coins or pieces of silver, are given by the groom to his bride as a symbol of security. After the wedding vows are stated during the Mass, a lazo, a cord with two connected loops, is draped over the couple, to symbolize the union of bride and groom. Just before the couple leaves the church, the bride, or sometimes a designated child, will pay tribute to La Virgen de Guadalupe by placing flowers at the foot of her statue or picture. There are always lots of padrinos (godfathers) and madrinas (godmothers), bridegrooms and bridesmaids, and of course Mariachi music.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chW.txt
The title of a book by the eminent professor Américo Paredes that has become a classic in American folklore and Chicano studies. With His Pistol in His Hand: A Border Ballad and Its Hero, published in 1958 by the University of Texas Press, is not only one of the most important academic works on the history of the Chicano, but it is also respected as major scholarship in the field of folklore studies, and specifically on the genre of the ballad. It is a study of a border ballad, “El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,” which looks at the history of the Texas-Mexican border and the life of Gregorio Cortez, and presents an analysis of the man as a ballad hero. As stated by Paredes himself in the introduction, “It is an account of the life of a man, of the way that songs and legends grew up about his name, and of the people who produced the songs, the legends, and the man” (1958, 1). It was in this work that Paredes proposed his theory of the production of Chicano folklore, and especially the border ballad, as a result of a process of border conflict generated by the invasion of Anglo culture and values into the Texas region in the early nineteenth century. The balladry of the Rio Grande border was “one of resistance against outside encroachment” (1958, 244). There was an “inner need” for the people to compose ballads that sang of the deeds of a man standing up for his rights, who in the process is transformed into a hero. Often, the man is nonviolent, but is coerced through persecution or abuse into killing his enemy, often a Texas Ranger, and must escape to the border. “His defeat is assured; . . . often he is killed or captured. But whatever his fate, he has stood up for his right” (149).<n>When the book was published it caused quite a stir in Texas because of its negative portrayal of the Texas Rangers. The chief editor at the University of Texas Press asked Paredes to delete his critical references to Walter Prescott Webb, J. Frank Dobie, and the Texas Rangers. The book was eventually published in spite of his refusal to make any changes. The timing of its publication was crucial, in 1958, for its powerful influence on Chicano students and intellectuals, since it came out just before the start of the Chicano movement of the 1960s. Its intellectual and political impact on a whole generation of Chicano scholars cannot be overstated. Almost all publications on Chicanos and Mexicanos up to that date had been written by Anglo American sociologists or anthropologists, and the few published Hispano scholars, such as Aurelio Espinosa and Arthur Campa, were only known within a narrow circle of folklore specialists. Gregorio Cortez, the border hero, and Américo Paredes, the scholar hero, both became figures that young Chicano students could respect and emulate.<n>See also “El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez”; Corridos; Paredes, Américo; Los Rinches<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chW.txt
A specter is haunting Europe,” Karl Marx and Frederick Engels wrote in 1848, as the first sentence of The Communist Manifesto. The specter they had in mind eventually became a political movement that came to dominate nearly half the world in the twentieth century. Behind this movement, however, lay an even more powerful idea that Marx had inspired—a Marxist conception of reality. The marketplace of economic relationships is not what it seems to be. Workers enter into seemingly voluntary contracts with employers, but underlying this system of apparent cooperation is a vast system of exploitation. Those who hold capital reap profits off the backs of those whom they hire as their laborers. This generates a dynamic of history that should, according to the theory, eventually produce a revolution by the exploited class of laborers. This theory failed to recognize the just contribution of capital in generating the opportunity to work, and the political incarnation of Marxism turned out to be historically more transient than expected. Nonetheless, the insight remains with us that relationships of employment—indeed all forms of relationship—require more than nominal consent to be legitimate. Behind the appearance of voluntary interaction there lurks the ever-present possibility of unjust exploitation.<n>The Marxist challenge was but the beginning of a continuing critique of the idea of freedom, so revered at the close of the eighteenth century. Behind the nominal appearance of freedom lies a structure of influence, a set of conditions that influences people to make the choices they do. Sometimes these influences are morally desirable. Peer group and family pressure can lead people to finish their university degree or to stay in difficult marriages or to remain loyal when tempted to act in self-interest. Looking back, individuals who make these choices under social influence are often grateful for the external inducement to do the right thing. Yet, economic and social conditions can also lead people to enter into socially and economically oppressive relationships, abusive marriages, and postures of dependence on drugs and alcohol. They can be induced to undress and prostrate themselves on stages in front of booths with one-way windows. The fact that people are influenced by others or their economic and emotional needs is, in itself, morally neutral, but the results can vary widely.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt
The intention of those who framed the Reconstruction Amendments should, therefore, not control their interpretation today. But what about the intention of Abraham Lincoln, when he mounted the podium on November 19, 1863? There are some who will say that if Lincoln did not intend specifically to articulate the preamble to a new constitution, then the words spoken at Gettysburg could not possibly be, as I claim, the preamble to the postbellum constitution. If Roosevelt did not intend to amend the Constitution with his court-packing plan, then the resulting changes in Supreme Court attitudes could not constitute a de facto amendment, a radical transformation of American law.<n>Here we take a page from British constitutional history to understand how a practice can be become part of the accumulated historical constitution without this being the purpose of those who initiated the practice. The British Constitution remains, as is well known, famously unwritten. Customary rules determine the role of the Crown in a system that has evolved as a constitutional monarchy. Only the accepted practice of generations prescribes that the queen must sign legislation for it to be binding as law or that the queen may intervene, under certain circumstances, to break a party deadlock and select a nominee for prime minister.19 In all systems of customary law, the relevant perspective is not that of those who first engage in the practice but rather of those who witness the pattern of the past and adopt it as binding on themselves. So it is with the Gettysburg Address. The right question is not what Lincoln intended, but rather what the words meant to those who looked to them as the explanation of the war and as a charter for freedom and equality for all Americans. If the address had been ignored, it would not have mattered what Lincoln intended. But because these 268 words20 were adopted into the civil religion of the United States—the secular meditation on who we were and what we were about—their life after formal recitation by the president determines their constitutional status. They are the preamble to the constitutional order because we came to understand them as nearly sacred. And although we did not until now think of this secular prayer as the preamble to a new order of nationhood, equality, and democracy, that is what they became.<n>These words are, in fact, better known in the United States than the preamble to the first Constitution. Schoolchildren routinely recite them and thereby imbibe the intuition that these words defined America after the Civil War. Yet, because we know these resonant phrases, we rarely stop to listen and ponder the meaning of each well-crafted line. Let us now put ourselves among the crowd of mourners at Gettysburg. Let us transport ourselves back into the frame of mind of those suffering losses, those looking for the meaning of brothers slaughtering brothers.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt
It did not occur to Lincoln that there might be some dissonance between his relying on 1776 as the beginning of the American nation and his acting in an office constituted by a document drafted in 1787. When he returned to the same figure of eighty-seven years in November of the same year, he meant to stress the continuity of the nation. In Lincoln’s vision, the men who died at Gettysburg gave their lives not for a government, not for a constitution, but to realize the peculiarly American blend of nationhood and a set of ideas, particularly the idea that the nation was “conceived in freedom.” There might be some disagreement about the moment of national coalescing, but to be sure, the nation was at war by 1775. A year later, American patriots exposed themselves to great risk by appearing to have committed treason. It is with some appropriate fear of reprisal that they conclude the Declaration of Independence: “We mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.”<n>Lincoln’s posture toward the 1787 Constitution was less than reverent. He treated the founding charter of the government more as a guideline to action than as a set of absolute restrictions on his actions. His decisions, particularly in the early stages of the war, suggest a willingness to assert extraconstitutional executive power and, thus, to permit the exigencies of war to restructure the government. In April 1861, in the immediate shadow of the shelling of Fort Sumter, he declared a blockade on Southern ports. Whether the Union forces could properly seize ships without congressional approval became one of the early legal controversies of the war.2 And then came the dispute about Lincoln’s authorizing his generals in the field to suspend the writ of habeas corpus—the great writ by which the courts retain the power to supervise the arrest and detention of criminal suspects. The Constitution permits suspension of this protection in times of civil unrest—but fails to specify whether the president may act unilaterally in ordering suspension. Sitting alone as a circuit judge, Chief Justice Taney interpreted the constitutional provision to require congressional authorization for suspending the writ.3 In light of Taney’s notorious opinion in the Dred Scott case,4 his views hardly carried much weight in the White House. In a move widely regarded as authoritarian, Lincoln simply disregarded Taney’s opinion. Lincoln justified his unilateral action with a famous claim of necessity, articulated in a message to Congress on July 4, 1861:<n>The whole of the laws which were required to be faithfully executed were being resisted . . . in nearly one third of the States. Must they be allowed to finally fail of execution, even had it been perfectly clear that by the use of the means necessary to their execution some single law, made in such extreme tenderness of the citizen’s liberty that, practically, it relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent, should to a very limited extent be violated? . . . Are all the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated?5<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt
Read with our current sensitivity to civil liberties, these are embarrassing words. Lincoln argues, in effect, that he can justify violating a constitutional prescription by appealing to the necessity of the moment. Of course, if the stark option were posed—violating this “one law” or letting the government “go to pieces”—most of us would agree that the government should survive the emergency, even by transgressing the Constitution. Yet, there is no evidence that the country’s circumstances were anywhere near this flashpoint of imminent destruction. And Lincoln’s casual disdain for the writ of habeas corpus (“it relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent”) reveals a lack of appreciation for the point of constitutional protections in criminal procedure. My own reading is that Lincoln’s suspending the writ on his own initiative and disregarding Taney’s supposed invalidation of the decision testifies to an altered state of constitutional thinking. The Constitution of 1787 lay suspended in the fires of battle. A new constitutional order would arise from the war, but no one quite knew what shape it would take.<n>Of course, during the war, the 1787 Constitution remained nominally in force. There was little suggestion of a “military dictatorship,” though some Northern critics of the government invoked the phrase. Lincoln’s elected term came to an end in March 1865. In the midst of the war, therefore, he was constitutionally required to stand for reelection. This event in itself warranted the stability of American institutions, but still ambiguity reigned on the shape of the postbellum constitutional order. The confusion came to a head in 1868 when the House impeached Lincoln’s successor, President Andrew Johnson, for arguably asserting excessive executive power in firing his Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. The outcome of that impeachment trial is well known: Johnson avoided conviction by one vote. Less well known is the outcome of the struggle to develop a new constitutional order, the struggle that is signaled in Lincoln’s address commemorating the dead at Gettysburg.<n>. . . our fathers brought forth on this continent. . . The biblical cadence of these words resonates in memory. We know that we have encountered it someplace before. They remind us of the way God introduces himself to Moses in the Book of Exodus: “I am the God of your father . . . So I have come down to rescue [my people] from the hand of Egypt, to bring it up from that land to a land, goodly and spacious, to a land flowing with milk and honey. . . .” It is not surprising that Lincoln would evoke the style of Exodus. Even the introductory phrase “four score and seven” has a prophetic ring. The Bible, after all, was one of Lincoln’s favorite books—along with the works of Shakespeare and Aesop’s Fables.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt
Given the long history of popular belief in the intrinsic superiority of certain classes of people—men, whites, Christians, Americans—the philosophical belief in equality stands as a critique of commonly held beliefs. It is clear that the popular culture still harbors many biases about some people being intrinsically better, entitled to greater privileges, than others. Yet, the long-range popular trend favors overcoming our biases in favor of a belief in the equality of all humanity. The American Revolution took the first step by abolishing the privileges of the nobly born. The 1787 Constitution prohibits both the states and the federal government from granting “titles of nobility.”8 There was this much equality in the founding, but anchoring the “peculiar institution” of slavery in the Constitution was the great “offence” against equality that could be expiated only on the killing fields of Gettysburg and Antietam.<n>The postbellum history of the United States has carried the egalitarian message of Gettysburg into the liberation of ever more marginal groups. After the emancipation of blacks, the movement for women’s suffrage gained strength and finally triumphed in 1920, and then in unclear succession came the contemporary efforts toward the equal treatment of homosexuals, “illegitimate” children, the handicapped, and even undocumented aliens.9 The thrust toward inclusion of more and more groups within the inner circle of the equally privileged has been one of the central themes of American life. Yet, even the victory of the Civil War is not yet complete. The badges and vestiges of slavery still haunt the land. The quest for redemption from the original sin of slavery continues in our own time.<n>Our sensibilities are conditioned by our history. But, however difficult the struggle, we have a history of which we can be proud. We Americans were the first to conceptualize the great maxim of equality and to label it a self-evident truth. No other legal system, so far as I can tell, relies explicitly on the principle that all human beings are created in the image of God. Yet, all modern legal systems and international documents of human rights today subscribe to the principle of equality before the law. Typical of the American influence is the 1789 French Declaration of the Rights of Man, which provides in the second part of Article 6: “The law must be the same for everyone, regardless whether it serves to protect or to punish.”10<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt
Equality before the law is the most limited claim of human equality. This form of equality applies only to fellow nationals and residents subject to the same legal order. More ambitious are the arguments of the philosophers such as Ackerman and Rawls who claim that equality is the first principle of social justice. At the outer reaches of principle, we find the great maxim invoked in the Gettysburg Address: All human beings are equal in the sight of God.<n>Let us limit our thinking, for the time being, to the most modest claim—that all individuals, black and white, men and women, gay and straight, born in wedlock and out of wedlock, should be treated equally under the law. We did not recognize this principle in the 1787 Constitution. It came into our positive law—the law actually applied by the courts—in 1868 with the Fourteenth Amendment. But what is the grounding for this transformation in our attitudes toward equality under law? Did we need the more radical faith in equality in the sight of God to discover the imperative of treating everyone equally under the law? Is equality under law limited to Americans? If so, why does the Fourteenth Amendment literally protect all “persons” against the American states that deprive them of equal protection of the laws? These are the difficult issues to which we now turn.<n>The Nation as the Crucible<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt
Andrew Johnson’s plan for Reconstruction was plagued by controversies about whether the previously disloyal were still full members of the nation and whether blacks, once emancipated, should ascend a step higher and receive the franchise on equal terms with whites. Lincoln imagined grounding the equality between black and white, Northern and Southern, in a shared sense of nationhood. With the rancorous infighting that dominated Congress in the period 1865 to 1870, the relevance of nationhood began to recede. More important were the ideological issues of loyalty, personal desert, and political self-interest. The question of the black franchise became associated with the fears of Democrats that a coalition of freedmen and Republicans would dominate the postbellum South.<n>But this should not surprise us. Politics merely occupies the surface of our lives. The give-and-take of daily conflict can lead us easily to forget both our shared purposes and our enduring principles. The Civil War had ushered in a commitment to the equality of all members of the nation. Whatever the struggle for adoption may have been, the language of egalitarian principle came into force. By 1868, we had in place a clause in the Fourteenth Amendment that was unique in American constitutional history: no state could “deprive any person of the equal protection of the laws.” What this clause would imply in practice, no one quite knew. We did know, however, that the legal idea of equality carried no historical gloss. The Constitution had already spoken of “privileges and immunities”12 and the Bill of Rights, of securing “life, liberty, and property” against deprivation “without due process of law.”13 But the Constitution had never before contained the notion of equality of persons before the law.<n>The remarkable feature of this ideal-bearing language is that it protects all persons within the power of the state—all those whom the state can touch with its legal power. This was hardly a self-evident way for the provision to be drafted. Given the nationalist background of our sentiments of equality, one could readily have formulated the clause: “No state shall deny to any American citizen within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” That is, because we were bound together foremost as fellow Americans, one would expect a commitment first to the equal treatment of all Americans. The Weimar Constitution in Germany found this to be a perfectly natural way of formulating the commitment to equality: All Germans are equal before the Law.14 It was not until the postwar Basic Law came to be in 1949 that West Germany recognized that a commitment to equality had to be universal. The provision now reads: All human beings are equal before the Law.15 The striking fact is that Americans came to this principle of universalization as early as 1868.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt

The Civil War enabled Americans of different cultural strains, some with power, others without, to see themselves as compatriots of a single nation. Their mutual recognition as partners in a common struggle generated a sense that at least they—the Americans—were created equal.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt
For Americans in the postbellum period, the obstacles to revolutionary change were daunting. Emancipating the slaves was one thing, changing attitudes toward blacks was quite another. Americans of the 1860s were essentially the same people who had tolerated the institution of slavery; their judges were of the same background and schooling as those who had declared in the Dred Scott decision that persons of African descent, whether born free or born in bondage, could never become citizens of the United States.<n>As part of its reconstructing the former Confederacy, the victorious North tried to cleanse the formerly rebellious governments of their “treasonous” followers. The Fourteenth Amendment, which the rebellious states were expected to ratify as the price for reinstating their right to representation in Congress, included a clause disqualifying from public office, in either the states or the federal government, anyone who had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution and thereafter “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.”2 This provision could conceivably have rid the South of those who supported the war for Southern independence, but it could not liberate the North from its judges and politicians who were ambivalent about the equality of all citizens. The membership of the Supreme Court changed entirely between the time of the Dred Scott decision in 1857 and the first major constitutional decision of the postbellum period in 1872. Yet, the judges who came onto the court still carried with them the values and confusions of their antebellum youth. They could not easily imbibe an entirely new spirit of nationhood and a strong commitment to equality. Their justice did not express the vision of the victor but rather the reluctant judgment from within that the vanquished, too, had arguments on their side.<n>Securing a nominal legal change in the form of the black-letter rules of constitutional revisions was not so difficult. The Thirteenth Amendment was ratified as soon as the war was over, and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth followed within five years. By 1870, the language of revolutionary change was in place. The only question was whether the words on paper would bring about a fundamental change in American self-government.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
Had the United States been able to begin anew, with judges educated in the values and vision of Gettysburg, with a new generation unaffected by old habits of thought, Lincoln’s prophecy at Gettysburg might have prevailed. The commitment to “a single nation” of black and white would have provided the foundation for a jurisprudence of equality in the courts. The federal government would have become the watchdog of private relationships that approached too close to the forbidden line, defined in the Thirteenth Amendment as “slavery” or “previous condition of servitude.” The “self-evident truths” of the Declaration of Independence—the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness—could have generated the foundation of a new constitutional order. Yet, this was not to be the fate of postbellum America.<n>Part of the problem is the way we came to think of the great sacrifice that occurred on the battlefields of Gettysburg, Antietam, Vicksburg—all the places where Americans rushed to give their lives for the sake of vague principles. If we did not have the great articulation of the war’s aim that Lincoln gave us at Gettysburg, the entire enterprise would have reeked of the absurd. “I am fighting for my rights,” a Confederate soldier might have said—not too sure what those “rights” were. On the other side, in blue rather than gray, he might have said, “I am fighting for the Union” with the nagging sense that dying for a governmental structure was slightly ridiculous.<n>The Gettysburg Address was pregnant with the sentiment that the war expressed the fraternity of Americans. The bond was expressed not only toward the slaves who were liberated but also toward the two hundred thousand black men who fought side by side, though in separate battalions, with white men to liberate those still under domination.3 The national tie—the “bonds of affection”4 —is expressed as well toward the Confederate men in arms who, in Lincoln’s view, never ceased to be part of the American nation. This was a war between brothers. It was necessary to settle the inevitable family quarrel about the kind of nation the United States would become.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
The party of Lincoln became the radicals in Congress, and Lincoln’s successor, Andrew Johnson, himself from Tennessee with roots in the yeomanry of the former Confederacy, was less eager than Congress to effectuate a cleansing of the governments that had supported the rebellion. He was opposed to the Fourteenth Amendment, which would have subjected the states to continuing federal scrutiny, and he was at odds with Lincoln’s secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, who concurred in the effort to seek radical reconstruction of the South. Fearing that Johnson would fire Stanton, Congress passed a statute requiring congressional approval to remove a member of the presidential cabinet. Johnson resisted; he fired his secretary of war. In retaliation, the House began impeachment proceedings. After a fierce trial that Johnson himself did not attend, the president survived, by one senatorial vote short of the required two-thirds majority. Johnson was humbled and offered less resistance thereafter to congressional policies, including the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment.<n>Behind the Sturm und Drang of the nation’s first impeachment trial was a struggle for power between the Congress and the presidency. Would the constitutional structure that emerged from the war more closely resemble the European style of parliamentary democracy, with the executive cabined by congressional directives? Or would the presidency remain an independent third force of government? Wars have a way of throwing open basic questions of this sort, and by unleashing aggression within a society, a Civil War inevitably invites a redefinition of governmental power. Thus, a whole new set of issues came onto the agenda of constitutional discussion.<n>Among the most important of these was the proper relationship between the federal government and the states. This is the question of “federalism” that still preoccupies American constitutional lawyers. There is no doubt that the federal government came out of the war more powerful than ever. It had experimented with an income tax and, therefore, could look forward to more effective funding. It had coordinated the armies of the states and now it would undertake to guide the redevelopment and integration of the South in a society governed by a new set of values. The question now was whether under a new governmental structure with Washington at its head, the individual states could nourish the principle that they were the residual source of governmental power as set forth in the Tenth Amendment, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt

It would not do to regard the original thirteen as constituting one country superior to a second country constituted by states thereafter recognized.

6. Official policies of the government, discriminatory legislation, executive decisions not to hire blacks.<n>Except for purely private actions at home and official policies at the other extreme, the other points on this spectrum represent a mix of private decision making and government policies. In fitting the Fourteenth Amendment to the reality of these diverse combinations, the Court could have insisted on stage six as the threshold of behavior included within the scope of the amendment, thus limiting the supervisory power of the federal courts to the official action of state officials. But it was clear from the outset that this would make little sense. Discriminatory application of sound laws could not escape federal scrutiny simply because state officials acted beyond the scope of their authority. Limiting “state action” and official policies of the state would encourage officials to act beyond their legal competence. Thus, stage five came to be included within the ambit of state responsibility.<n>The fatal mistake in 1883 was concluding that everything below stage five could properly be classified as private or “social.” Justice Harlan’s dissent stresses that stages two, three, and four are also actions in the public domain that implicate the state in various ways—as enforcer, as beneficiary of the surrogate private enterprise, or by direct or indirect funding (e.g., tax incentives). Reading the Fourteenth Amendment with a view to what it was intended to accomplish would have yielded a more generous understanding of “state action.” The range of constitutionally relevant action would have included at least actions fulfilling the public functions of providing transportation, accommodations for travelers, education, and culture. And if the Court had so interpreted the notion of state action, it would have had no difficulty sustaining both the Civil Rights Act of 1875 and the convictions brought against the violators of the provision requiring equal access to theaters and other facilities open to the public.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
One might properly inquire how the idea of the nation’s expressing its will differs from “We the People” acting in concert for the sake of a better government. The differences are admittedly subtle. Perhaps the accent in Justice Harlan’s mind was on the historical bond implied in the war that held the nation together. Yet, it is no accident that the expression “We the People” is absent in the rhetoric of his dissenting opinion. The problem he addressed was not one that the people could decide for themselves. The question “Who constitutes the nation?” does not lend itself to democratic resolution. The question of nationhood logically precedes both government and the popular will. For the nation to express itself as “government of the people,” it must first come into being.<n>The nation does not constitute itself by popular vote or by a decision of government. The nation comes alive, as Lincoln viewed our history, as a bond forged in an historical struggle. The bond was first cast in 1774 with the first stirring of independence or, at the latest, in July 1776. The inclusion of emancipated slaves within the nation came as the only consequence of the Brothers’ War that could make sense of the national search for redemption.<n>Remarkably, the eight justices who signed the Court’s opinion invalidating the Civil Rights Act of 1875 used the vocabulary neither of peoplehood nor of nationhood. They had no conception of the American nation—or at least not one relevant to their legal analysis. Of course, they refer to the national government, a phrase in which “national” is synonymous with “federal” or “central.” Yet, they use the term “nation” in reference to France!52 I suppose that in the minds of the majority of justices, the United States constituted not a nation but a people still living under the Constitution they had designed and ratified in the 1780s.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
As a sequel to World War II, when black and white had again fought side by side, although still in segregated units, the will would again arise to fight for equality in a single nation. It would take a campaign of restaurant sit-ins and bus boycotts finally to correct the great error of the Civil Rights Cases. In 1964, four-score-years-and-one after the initial defeat in the Supreme Court, the country could once again say that equal access to theaters and public accommodations was the law of the land.<n>If we look at the legacy of the Slaughterhouse Case and the Civil Rights Cases together, we should note two additional casualties to the vision of a new postbellum legal order. In the first case, counsel raised the issue of economic discrimination, which had never received due attention from the Supreme Court. We turn in the next chapter to the legacy of that failure in ongoing economic discrimination in education. As race came center stage in the truncated arena of “equal protection,” the Supreme Court would ignore the tragedies of the states’ toleration of wealth and class discrimination. As we shall see, other countries have confronted the problem of wealth discrimination as an aspect of their commitment to equality. It will eventually be incumbent on the Supreme Court to do the same.<n>The second major casualty was the concept of “involuntary servitude” as invoked in the Thirteenth Amendment. Counsel tried, but they could not persuade the Supreme Court to think of the burdens imposed on the New Orleans butchers and on African Americans subject to public segregation as variations of the servitudes prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment. That concept had the potential of inducing a new role for government in the relationships between private parties. If servitudes should be understood as relationships of domination, then an open-ended approach to the concept would have generated a watchdog role for the federal government in inspecting and supervising private relationships of potential exploitation and domination. The Crescent City Company’s domination of the independent butchers, who had to pay tribute to practice the slaughtering trade, should have been a paradigm of impermissible domination. And the other paradigm of coerced servitude would have been the domination of blacks by whites in a segregated society.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt

The triangle would have consisted in the potentially dominant private party, the potentially subservient private party, and the government as the guarantor of relationships of equality and nondomination. It is not clear which branch of the federal government would have benefited most from a triadic relationship with private parties. Congress would have exercised its authority to legislate under the Thirteenth Amendment. The executive would have established commissions to keep tabs on relationships that came to public attention. Although the judiciary probably would have prospered as well, the Supreme Court of the 1870s and 1880s did not want to see the federal government become the watchdog of economic and semipublic racial relationships. Our history took a different course, one that required us to confront, in ways that we hardly expected, the moral difficulties of understanding equality under law.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
These amendments bespeak the philosophical principles of the Secret Constitution. A clear commitment to a universal right to vote finally takes hold. The franchise attaches not to those with qualifications, education, wealth, age, or even the supposed superiority that, according to the attitudes of 1920, men enjoyed in practical affairs. The franchise belongs to all Americans and even to resident noncitizens who are capable of knowing, in the minimal theory of democratic voting, when “the shoe pinches.”7 Lincoln’s vision of government “by all the people” was becoming the law of the land.<n>Also, elections for the presidency begin to take on the quality of a national referendum in place of a compilation of preferences by the individual states. People started voting and expressing themselves as the voice of the nation. Thus, it came to be obvious that citizens of the country who did not reside in the states (namely, those in the federal district) must also have the right to vote for national offices. The Constitution nominally retained the electoral college as a way of giving lip service to the states, but it is clear that the popular vote expresses the will of the nation. This became clear in the presidential election of 2000, discussed in detail in the Afterword. On the basis of the results certified on November 26, Governor George W. Bush acquired a one vote majority in the electoral college. Vice President Gore’s persistent legal challenge to the certified result depended, in part, on the sense of legitimacy he acquired from winning the confidence of the nation in the popular vote.<n>The remaining constitutional amendments fine-tune the workings of Congress and the presidency. The Twentieth shortens the lameduck period between the November election and the change of leadership in the following year. Previously the inauguration was prescribed for the beginning of March, but the amendment moved up the date to January 3 for Congress and January 20 for the presidency. Although this amendment appears simply to address matters of the calendar, it came into play recently in the dispute about whether an outgoing lameduck House of Representatives could, in the period between election and going out of office, constitutionally impeach President Clinton. Bruce Ackerman shocked the Capital by testifying before the House that the newly seated Senate could not constitutionally try the president on an impeachment passed by the outgoing House.8 The amendment also authorizes Congress to prescribe a mode of succession to the presidency between elections.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt

And the Twenty-Fifth (1967) regulates in detail the problem of transition when the president is still alive but incapable of executing the office. The last amendment, the Twenty-Seventh, prohibits congressionally legislated pay raises from taking effect until another national election has taken place, and a new Congress is sworn in. This last revision of the national charter also testifies to the theme of improving the workings of popular democracy: the people must be consulted before their elected representatives should be allowed to raise their own salaries. The curious twist in this last addition to the Constitution is that although it was finally ratified by three-fourths of the states in 1993, it was originally proposed by James Madison two hundred years earlier. Its formal roots lie in the original Constitution of 1787.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
This statement is just plain true. Look out your window, burrow down a foot or so, and try to establish what all the microscopic life is busy doing and building and has done for billions of years, let alone the macroscopic ecosystem of plants, herbivores, and carnivores that is slipping, sliding, hiding, hunting, bursting with flowers and leaves outside your window. So, I think, we lack a concept of propagating organization.<n>Then too there is the mystery of the emergence of novel functionalities in evolution where none existed before: hearing, sight, flight, language. Whence this novelty? I was led to doubt that we could prestate the novelty. I came to doubt that we could finitely prestate all possible adaptations that might arise in a biosphere. In turn, I was led to doubt that we can prestate the “configuration space” of a biosphere.<n>But how strange a conclusion. In statistical mechanics, with its famous liter box of gas as an isolated thermodynamic system, we can prestate the configuration space of all possible positions and momenta of the gas particles in the box. Then Ludwig Boltzmann and Willard Gibbs taught us how to calculate macroscopic properties such as pressure and temperature as equilibrium averages over the configuration space. State the laws and the initial and boundary conditions, then calculate; Newton taught us how to do science this way. What if we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and calculate with Newton’s “method of fluxions,” the calculus, from initial and boundary conditions and laws? Whether we can calculate or not does not slow down the persistent evolution of novelty in the biosphere. But a biosphere is just another physical system. So what in the world is going on? Literally, what in the world is going on?<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
The telltale beginnings of that larger story are beginning to be formulated. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Agency has had a long program in “exobiology,” the search for life elsewhere in the universe. Among its well-known interests are SETI, a search for extraterrestrial life, and the Mars probes. Over the past three decades, a sustained eVort has included a wealth of experiments aiming at discovering the abiotic origins of the organic molecules that are the building blocks of known living systems.<n>In the summer of 1997, NASA was busy attempting to formulate what it came to call “astrobiology,” an attempt to understand the origin, evolution, and characteristics of life anywhere in the universe. Astrobiology does not yet exist = it is a field in the birthing process. Whatever the area comes to be called as it matures, it seems likely to be a field of spectacular success and deep importance in the coming century. A hint of the potential impact of astrobiology came in August 1997 with the tentative but excited reports of a Martian meteorite found in Antarctica that, NASA scientists announced, might have evidence of early Martian microbial life. The White House organized the single-day “Space Conference,” to which I was pleased to be invited. Perhaps thirty-five scientists and scholars gathered in the Old Executive OYce Building for a meeting led by Vice President Gore. The vice president began the meeting with a rather unexpected question to the group: If it should prove true that the Martian rock actually harbored fossilized microbial life, what would be the least interesting result?<n>The room was silent, for a moment. Then Stephen Jay Gould gave the answer many of us must have been considering: “Martian life turns out to be essentially identical to Earth life, same DNA, RNA, proteins, code.” Were it so, then we would all envision life flitting from planet to planet in our solar system. It turns out that a minimum transit time for a fleck of Martian soil kicked into space to make it to earth is about fifteen thousand years. Spores can survive that long under desiccating conditions.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
Ways of making a living, natural games, that are well searched out and well mastered by the evolutionary search strategies of organisms, namely, mutation and recombination, will be precisely the niches, or ways of making a living, that a diversifying and speciating population of organisms will manage to master. The ways of making a living presenting fitness landscapes that can be well searched by the procedures that organisms have in hand will be the very ways of making a living that readily come into existence. If there were a way of making a living that could not be well explored and exploited by organisms as they speciate, that way of making a living would not become populated. Good jobs, like successful jobholders, prosper.<n>So organisms, niches, and search procedures jointly and self-consistently coconstruct one another! We make the world in which we make a living such that we can, and have, more or less mastered that evolving world as we make it. The same is true, I will argue, for an econosphere. A web of economic activities, firms, tasks, jobs, workers, skills, and learning, self-consistently came into existence in the last forty thousand years of human evolution.<n>The strange thing about the theory of evolution is that everyone thinks he understands it. But we do not. A biosphere, or an econosphere, self-consistently coconstructs itself according to principles we do not yet fathom.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
Many of us have now explored the application of Bak’s ideas in models of coevolution that I will discuss shortly. With caveats that other explanations may account for the data, the general result is that something may occur that is like a theory of coevolutionary assembly that yields a self-organized critical biosphere with a power law distribution of small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events. As we shall see, the best data now suggest that precisely such a power law distribution of extinction and speciation events has occurred over the past 650 million years of the Phanerozoic. In addition, the same body of theory predicts that most species go extinct soon after their formation, while some live a long time. The predicted species lifetime distribution is a power law. So too are the data.<n>Similar phenomena may occur in an econosphere. Small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events occur in our technologies. A colleague, Brian Arthur, is fond of pointing out that when the car came in, the horse, buggy, buggy whip, saddlery, smithy, and Pony Express went out of business. The car paved the way for an oil and gas industry, paved roads, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote about this kind of turbulence in capitalist economies. These Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction appear to occur in small and large avalanches. Perhaps the avalanches arise in power laws. And, like species, most firms die young; some make it to old age = Storre, in Sweden, is over nine hundred years old. The distribution of firm lifetimes is again a power law.<n>Here are hints = common law, ecosystems, economic systems = that general principles govern the coevolutionary coconstruction of lives and livings, organisms and natural games, firms and economic opportunities. Perhaps such a law governs any biosphere anywhere in the cosmos.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
Autonomous Agents<n>Some wellspring of creation, lithe in the scattered sunlight of an early planet, whispered something to the gods, who whispered back, and the mystery came alive. Agency was spawned. With it, the nature of the universe changed, for some new union of matter, energy, information, and something more could reach out and manipulate the world on its own behalf. Selfish? Yes. But how does matter, energy, information, and something else miraculous become selfish? From that miracle grew a biosphere = and, we must surmise, from that grow other biospheres, scattered seeds and gardens across the cosmos.<n>Pregnant in the birth of the universe was the birth of life. Agency may be coextensive with life. Life certainly burgeons nowhere without agency. We all act on our own behalf. In the Kantian form: What must something be such that it can act on its own behalf?<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
The equation F = MA is a definitional circle, according to Poincaré. Many physicists disagree with Poincaré. I tend to agree, but then I am not a physicist, so take care.<n>On the other hand, the great twentieth-century philosopher Ludwig Witt-gen-stein said something similar in his majestic Philosophical Investigations. Witt-genstein came to his revolutionary investigations painfully, ultimately rejecting his own earlier triumph in the Tractatus. Indeed, part of why I have so blatantly borrowed Wittgenstein’s title, without my presumption to similar intellectual stature, is that there is a parallel between Wittgenstein’s abandonment of the Tractatus and growing awareness of knowing as living a language game, and a central theme of this Investigations, that there may be a limit to the way Newton taught us to do science and a need to reformulate what we do when we and other agents get on with living a life. As we will see, in both cases, it appears that something profound is going on in the universe that is not finitely prestatable. Life and language games seem persistently open to radical innovations that cannot be deduced from previous categories and concepts. I will only be able to discuss these issues more fully after we have encountered autonomous agents and their unfolding mysteries.<n>In his early Tractatus, Wittgenstein had brought to conclusion the mandate of logical atomism from Russell. Logical atomism sought a firm epistemological foundation for all knowledge in terms of privileged “atomic statements” about “sense data.” The idea, flowing from Hume to Berkeley to Kant then back to British empiricism, was the following: One might be mistaken in saying that a chair is in the room, but one could hardly be mistaken in reporting bits and pieces of one’s own awareness. For example, “I am having the experience of a brown color”; “I am aware of the note A-flat.” These statements were thought to record sense data and to be less susceptible to error than statements about the “external world” of chairs, rocks, and legal systems. Logical atomism sought to reconstruct statements about the external world from logical combinations of atomic statements about sense data. The Tractatus sought to bring that program to fruition   .   .   .    and nearly succeeded.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
The problem, briefly, is that there appears to be no finitely prestatable set of conditions about sense data statements whose truth is logically equivalent to any statement about a real physical chair in a living room.<n>Wittgenstein invented the concept of a “language game,” a codefined cluster of concepts that carve up the world in some new way. Consider, he said, legal language, and try translating it to ordinary statements about human agents without using legal concepts. So consider, “The jury found Henderson guilty of murder.” We understand this statement but do so in the context of law, evidence, legal responsibility, trials, guilt and innocence, jury systems, bribing jury members, appeal processes, and so forth. Now try to translate the statement into a set of statements about ordinary human actions, “A group of twelve people were seated behind a wooden enclosure for several days. People talked about someone having died of poison. One day, the twelve people left the room and went to another room and talked about what had happened. Then the twelve people came back and one man stood up and uttered the words, ‘We find Henderson guilty of murder.’”<n>There is no finitely prespecifiable list of statements about ordinary human actions whose truth would be necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement that the jury found Henderson guilty of murder.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Indeed, Hume’s injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements. We scientists find the facts. You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics. But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is, where do values come from at all? Hume’s injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category “ought.”<n>The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long, twisted, arduous. Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful, philosophers as famous as G. E. Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances. “It is wrong to kill.” Becomes, “Agggah!” Does the positivist argument seem persuasive? It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists, “only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful,” is itself not empirically verifiable. One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards.<n>John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all “contractually” agree to, were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments. Thus “equality before the law” is one contract that Rawls commends to us. “Equality before the law” is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium. The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt
Hierarchies of Autonomous Agents<n>For a start, there appears to be an indefinite hierarchy of autonomous agents. At least in our biosphere, there is a considerable hierarchy of autonomous agents. Consider first a single-cell organism, prokaryote, cells without nuclei such as E. coli in your gut. E. coli, my canonical autonomous agent. Next, consider a eukaryote, yeast, also in your gut, also an autonomous agent. In the passage from prokaryote to eukaryotic cell, it appears that a collection of autonomous agents came to live together permanently. Eukaryotes contain mitochondria, and plant cells contain plastids with chlorophyll. In both cases, these intracellular organelles carry their own DNA, with a slightly modified genetic code in the case of mitochondria. These facts have suggested to Lynn Margulis the now rather well-accepted hypothesis that eukaryotic cells are symbionts of two or more earlier separate autonomous agents that contributed the mitochondria, the plastids, and perhaps the nuclear structure of eukaryotes into a single novel reproducing entity, the eukaryotic cell.<n>The eukaryotic cell, then, is a well-behaved society of autonomous agents that are now symbiotic, hence, the eukaryotic cell is a higher-order autonomous agent, comprised of lower-order autonomous agents.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
We have beginning mathematical models that reveal something about this hierarchical organization = although the best current models are curiously limited despite their brilliance.<n>Walter Fontana is a theoretical chemist trained by Peter Schuster in Vienna. Walter came to the Santa Fe Institute and made a major intellectual step called “Alchemy.” In chapter 2, I described the emergence of autocatalytic sets of molecular species in a chemical reaction graph. By rather independent intellectual routes that began with physicist John McCaskill’s eVorts to create a computer soup of Turing machines that “operated” on one another, Walter invented “algorithmic chemistry.” Naturally, and most naturally in Santa Fe, where one can be healed by means known nowhere else in the universe, Walter nicknamed algorithmic chemistry “Alchemy.” Unlike the alchemy of Newton’s time, Walter’s works.<n>Here is alchemy: Walter borrowed a computer language known as “lisp.” Lisp expressions can operate on one another. So expression 1 encounters expression 2. At random, it is decided if 1 will operate on 2 or 2 will operate on 1. Whichever way, after the operation, the lisp expression that was operated on typically is transformed into a new lisp expression.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
What had Walter found? The first thing he found were “copiers,” that is, lisp expressions that could copy any lisp expression, including themselves. Once such replicators emerged, they took over Walter’s steaming pot of lisp expressions. Indeed, such a lisp expression is rather like Jack Szostak’s hoped-for RNA polymerase, able to copy any RNA sequence, including itself. Walter called such copiers “type-1” organizations.<n>Could other self-reproducing organizations emerge? Walter “cheated” and simply disallowed copier replicators to occur. Bereft of copiers, Walter’s soup ripped forward again. Again novel lisp expressions came forth in profusion. Again, after a while, a recurrent set of lisp expressions emerged.<n>What had Walter found? He found collectively autocatalytic sets of lisp expressions, essentially identical to my collectively autocatalytic sets of polymers. Walter called these “type-2” organizations. In each such collectively autocatalytic lisp set, each expression is formed by the action of some lisp expression on some lisp expression in the set. The set as a whole is collectively reproducing.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
One contentious issue leads us to another. And now I hope to trouble you deeply.<n>Tomasina was but one of many lineages of creatures evolving much as Darwin taught us, by heritable variation and natural selection. Let’s turn to a Darwinian account of the function of the heart. Roughly, Darwin would say, the function of the heart is to pump blood. Namely, Darwin would say, this causal consequence of the heart is the virtue for which it was, and persistently is, selected by natural selection. I tend to think Darwin’s account of the heart is correct. Notice that the form of the account is ontological. Hearts came into existence, somehow, and are sustained because it is advantageous to organisms to have a means to pump blood.<n>But the heart has other causal consequences. For example, the heart makes heart sounds as its valves open and close. Presumably, heart sounds are not the causal consequences of the heart upon which natural selection has acted. Heart sounds are not the function of the heart.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
But can we finitely prestate all possible exaptations for all possible organisms, or even the current organisms, in our biosphere? Again, while I’m still not certain how to prove my claim, I claim the answer is no. We cannot prestate the configuration space of the biosphere. But notice our failure is not hindering the biosphere from exapting all the time. Gertrude did it. And every bacterium whose molecules wiggle in a useful way that turn out to detect a source of energy or danger or opportunity in some novel fashion tends to be selected for that novel functionality. Look at the rate of emergence of bacteria resistant to our antibiotics and the myriad unexpected ways such resistance arises at the molecular level. Who could have foretold the ways?<n>The example of the common emergence of Darwinian preadaptations in the biosphere may point to an interesting connection with the diYculty Fontana and others have had achieving the persistent emergence of more complexity in algorithmic models such as alchemy and Tierra. Gertrude did fly, and thereby the capacity of her folds of skin to function as wings were selected. Flying squirrels came to exist in the universe. Restated, a property of Gertrude = indeed, here a collective property of her atomic constituents = made itself manifest in the real physical world in a context that lent survival advantage to Gertrude. Were we to have a formal algorithmic description of a formal simulated algorithmic Gertrude that did not have as an algorithmic consequence that her skin flaps might function as wings, then the emergence of the higher-order category of “winged squirrel” could not be derived algorithmically. Similarly, were we to have a formal description of an engine block that did not include its rigidity, we could not algorithmically derive that the engine block could be used as a chassis.<n>But, we might ask, could we not have a complete physical description of Gertrude or the engine block such that all possible properties might be derived from that complete physical description? The answer is almost certainly no. It is an old philosophic realization that there is no finite description of a simple physical object in its context. For example, the coVee table in my living room is made of three wooden planks, four short squat legs, runners between all pairs of legs. The middle board has a crack in it some eight inches long, a quarter of an inch wide at the end of the board, narrowing to nothing along a particular curved arc. A second crack, smaller, is six inches from the first crack. A cracker is on the table. A personal computer is on the table. The first crack is seven feet from the door. The second crack is seven feet six inches from the door. Both cracks are 256,000 miles from the moon and 4.3 light years from the nearest star. A dead grasshopper is on the table to the left of the end of the first crack and about 4.3 light years from the nearest star. A mote of dust hovers an inch above the table, two inches from a leaf that drifts down from a ficus in the living room.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
We need a theory of the persistent coming into existence of new goods and services and extinction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera.<n>But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. With the horse went the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. With the car came paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. Most firms die young, some last a long time. We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions.<n>The parallels are at least tantalizing, and probably more than that. While the mechanisms of heritable variation dier and the selection criteria dier, organisms in the biosphere and firms and individuals in the econosphere are busy trying to make a living and explore new ways of making a living. In both cases, the puzzling conditions for the evolutionary cocreation and coassembly of increasing diversity are present. The biosphere and econosphere are persistently transforming, persistently inventing, persistently dying, persistently getting on with it, and, on average, persistently diversifying. And into a framework of such a diversifying set of goods and services we must graft the central insights of general competitive equilibrium as the approximate short-timescale mechanism that achieves a rough-and-ready approximate clearing of markets at each stage of the evolution of the economy.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt

We have spun out a biotechnology company, CIStem Molecular, that aims to clone the small cis acting DNA regions that control turning genes on and o in development and disease; a European daughter company, Euro-Bios; as well as EXA, a company spun out with NASDAQ to make tools for financial markets. I’m deeply glad to be chairman of the board and chief scientist of Bios, to be working with a very creative group of colleagues, and to be finding routes in the practical world where our ideas do, in fact, apply.<n>I mention Bios and my involvement because some of the science we have done bears on diverse aspects of practical economics and even begins to suggest pathways beyond the limitations of the Arrow-Debreu theory. I begin with Boeing, which came to Bios wondering how to design and build airplanes in a year rather than seven years. Out of what modular parts and processes, wonder Boeing folks, might it be possible to assemble a family of related aircraft for a diversity of markets?<n>The obvious approach was to invent “Lego World.” As founding general partner and chief scientist, I duly authorized the expenditure of $. to buy a largish box of Lego parts. (In truth, I fib. I actually won the Lego box at our first Bios Christmas party.)<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
Indeed, in the same way in an ecosystem, organisms create niches for other organisms. I suspect, therefore, that over the past . billion years, the growth of diversity of species is autocatalytic, for the number of possible niches increases more rapidly than the number of species filling niches. And in the linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes, the universe as a whole advances autocatalytically into its adjacent possible, driven by the very increase of diversity by which novel displacements from equilibrium come into existence, are detected, are coupled to, and come to drive the endergonic creation of novel kinds of molecules and other entities. Economic growth is part and parcel of the creativity of the universe as a whole.<n>Think of the Wright brothers’ airplane. It was a recombination between an airfoil, a light gasoline engine, bicycle wheels, and a propeller. The more objects an economy has, the more novel objects can be constructed. When we were working with rough stone in the Lower Paleolithic, we pretty much mastered everything that could be done until pressure flaking came along. Most forms of simple stone tools that could be made were made. Today, the adjacent possible of goods and services is so vast that the economy, stumbling and lunging into the future adjacent possible, will only construct an ever smaller subset of the technologically possible.<n>The economy is ever more historically contingent   .   .   . As the biosphere is ever more historically contingent   .   .   . As, I suspect, the universe is ever more historically contingent.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
In turn, this led me to think about and discuss natural games, or ways of making a living. Since ways of making a living evolve with the organisms making those livings, we got to the winning games are the games the winners play. Which led me to suggest that those ways of making a living that are well searched out and exploited by the search mechanisms organisms happen to use  mutation, recombination, and selection  will be ways of making a living that are well populated by organisms and similar species. Ways of making a living that cannot be well searched out by organisms and their mutation recombination search procedures will not be well populated.<n>So we came to the reasonable conclusion that a biosphere of autonomous agents is a self-consistently self-constructing whole, in which agents, ways of making a living, and ways of searching for how to make a living all work together to coconstruct the biosphere. Happily, we are picking the problems we can manage to solve. Of course, if we could not solve our chosen ways to make livings, we would be dead.<n>And there is, I think, a molecular clue that the biosphere is persistently coconstructing itself in the survivable regime for a propagating set of lineages. We have just characterized the survivable percolating web regime where the fitness landscape of each creature deforms due to the adaptive moves of other creatures, but there are always neighboring ways of surviving. Genetically, those neighboring ways are one or a few mutations or recombinations away from where the species population is right now. If the biosphere has coconstructed itself such that most species are in a survivable regime, then as coevolution occurs, most species will persist but may well transform, for example, to daughter species. One would guess that this mildly turbulent process is rather continuous, perhaps with some self-organized critical bursts on a power law scale.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
Fashion has increasingly—and restrictively—become a term used in connection with women’s dress, as in “fashion designer” or “the fashion industry.” The Oxford English Dictionary defines fashion more broadly as “the mode of dress, etiquette, furniture, style of speech, etc., adopted in a society for the time being.” People have to cut their hair, eat, clothe themselves, decorate their homes—fashion affects how they do these things. According to the French historian Fernand Braudel, fashion affects everything. “It covers ideas as much as costume, the current phrase as much as the coquettish gesture, the manner of receiving at table, the care taken in sealing a letter.”2 There is no reason to think that architecture is immune.<n>If style is the language of architecture, fashion represents the wide—and swirling—cultural currents that shape and direct that language. Gothic architecture originated in France in the twelfth century, and remained in fashion in Europe for the next three hundred years. It was used in the great cathedrals, and in such secular masterpieces as the Doge’s Palace in Venice, and the Westminster Hall in London. One of the last great Italian Gothic buildings was Milan Cathedral, begun in 1385. It was so large that the domical vault and crossing were not built until 55 years later by the great architect Filippo Brunelleschi. By then the Renaissance was well under way, thanks to Brunelleschi’s Foundling Hospital in Florence, generally considered the first building designed in the revived Classical style. With the rediscovery of Greek and Roman Classicism, Gothic became distinctly unfashionable. The old monuments were preserved, but they were not admired. “A fantastical and licentious manner of building,” is how Christopher Wren characterized Gothic architecture. So general was the dissatisfaction, that Gothic came to stand for anything that was considered wild, barbarous, or crude.<n>In the mid-eighteenth century, the term Gothic reappeared, not in architecture but in literature. The Gothic romance, a type of novel, was usually set in the medieval past and involved the fantastic and the supernatural. Jane Austen’s heroine in Northanger Abbey is a devotee of such books and spends many hours in “the luxury of a raised, restless, and frightened imagination over the pages of Udolpho.” Austen is referring to Anne Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho, one of the most popular Gothic romances of the day, whose setting is a mysterious castle in the Apennines. Such surroundings—monasteries, dungeons, castles—figured prominently in Gothic tales ever since Horace Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto, which was published in 1764 and is generally considered the first Gothic romance.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch2.txt
Allan Greenberg is a confirmed Classicist. He does not consider this an anomaly. “To be truly modern,” he writes, “means finding the dynamic balance between eternal human values and the specific demands of the present. Classical architecture provides the means to achieve this balance because it is the most comprehensive architectural language that human beings have yet developed.”11 Although Greenberg looks to the past, his is not the attitude of an archeologist. Like Carrère & Hastings, and generations of architects before them, Greenberg approaches Classicism as a tradition to be studied, absorbed—then extended.<n>Early in his career, after emigrating to the United States from South Africa, Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses, which led to an unusual commission: the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse. He gave the commercial building in Manchester, Connecticut, a new façade dominated by a large arch, over-scaled voussoirs, and a pediment. Inside, the barrel-vaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order. Greenberg had graduated from Yale in 1965, and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism. However, unlike Venturi and Moore, Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building; he was returning to Classical roots. From this modest beginning, over the next two decades, came a variety of commissions: a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building, several college and university buildings, and a Roman Catholic church. His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens, Georgia, a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills. Greenberg is also known for large country houses, both in the United States and in Europe. Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope, he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential work—using Georgian and American Colonial styles. One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon, another by Palladio’s unfinished Villa Thiene. Several are picturesque rambling affairs whose relaxed informality recalls the best work of McKim, Mead & White.<n>One of my favorite Greenberg houses is a cottage set among windblown dunes on the eastern seaboard. Completed in 1992, the low-lying building is shingled, but it is not exactly Shingle Style. Recent Shingle Style buildings are often broken down into many small parts, giving them a fussy and nervous appearance. Such seaside cottages look as if a good wind could blow them away. Greenberg’s aim here is to make a heavyweight building of great solidity that is rooted firmly in the dune scrub. The one-story Atlantic façade is almost perfectly symmetrical: a large arched window flanked by two semi-circular bays, rotund sentinels standing against the ocean winds. The two-story landward side is more informal, ringed by a sheltered porch. Massivity informs the details: sturdy Tuscan columns, a heavy cornice at the eaves of the large roof, rugged window frames. The sense of robustness is accentuated by occasional delicacy: the arched window incorporates scrolled brackets that support an elegant reverse ogee molding at the eaves. Inside, the fireplace has a brick hearth, a slate lintel, and a wood surround, whose almost modern simplicity is softened by a cavetto molding beneath the mantelpiece. The ceiling is supported by exposed trusses of rough, reused timbers. Although most people would describe this house as “traditional,” this is not an exercise in a particular historical style. There is a nod here to the British Arts and Crafts architect  C. F. A. Voysey, and it is obvious that Greenberg has looked at Lutyens’ country houses. But this is a modern house, although designed by an architect with a Classical sensibility. It admirably fulfills Palladio’s call for a correspondence of the whole with the parts and the parts with the whole.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch3.txt
No pair of architects could be more dissimilar than this distinctly odd couple, the proper High Society favorite of the Gilded Age and the untidy bohemian from Santa Monica. Yet they bear comparison. They were both late bloomers. Gehry was 48 when he gained national recognition. Until then, he had been running his own office in Los Angeles for almost twenty years, building shopping centers, suburban offices, department stores, and apartments in competent but unremarkable renditions of L.A. modern. The project that brought him to national attention was his own remodeled house: a nondescript bungalow encased in an unsettling Cubist composition of unpainted plywood, corrugated metal, and chain-link fencing. The odd shapes and unorthodox materials marked Gehry as a maverick. That was in 1978. Unexpectedly, he attracted a broad range of commissions, not only residential clients, but also museums, public institutions, universities, corporations, and developers, and not only in the United States but around the world.<n>Hunt was 43 when he came into his own. He had established an architectural practice in New York in 1855, almost immediately on his return from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He was moderately successful, achieving local renown for the Tribune Building, an early New York skyscraper. Despite his Parisian background, Hunt worked in the prevalent Ruskinian Gothic style. Of his Presbyterian Hospital in downtown Manhattan, the architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler wrote: “The building is of Gothic design with very red brick, and very irregular stone dressings, which, it must be confessed regretfully, are not pleasing to the eye.”3 For his next project, the Lenox Library, Hunt tried something different. He borrowed from the French Neo-Grec style, popularized by Labrouste in the Bibliothèque Sainte Geneviève, adding Renaissance details and his own characteristically vigorous surface modeling. The result was a startling departure from convention, a monochrome limestone block of imposing dignity. The Lenox Library (which stood on Fifth Avenue on the site of the present-day Frick Collection) marked a shift in architectural taste, away from Ruskin to a grand and frankly aesthetic Classicism. The 1880s was a decade of great prosperity, and newly wealthy New Yorkers eagerly sought out Hunt’s architectural blend of good taste and ostentatious display. He obliged them in a string of high-profile commissions: magnificent mansions along Fifth Avenue, country houses on Long Island, and palatial “cottages” in Newport, Rhode Island. Hunt died in 1895, but in the last seven years of his life, he completed more than fifty projects.<n>Biltmore House in Asheville, North Carolina, is a good example of his stylistic prowess. Hunt modeled the design of this 250-room residence on the Château de Blois, whose style is not the severe Classicism of the Italian Renaissance favored by architects such as Charles McKim, but the more ornate and picturesque French Renaissance. To a modern visitor, the spires, turrets, and steep slate roofs of Biltmore recall Disneyland’s Sleeping Beauty Castle, which is not surprising since Disney also used a Loire Valley chateau—the Château d’Ussé—as his model. But the comparison does Hunt an injustice, for his design is neither prettified nor quaint. His client, George W. Vanderbilt, was a young bachelor (he married soon after the house was finished), and for him Hunt created an architecture that is robust, masculine, and immensely self-assured, not in the least like a fairytale.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch3.txt

The flight had taken off just as American 11 was being hijacked, and at 8:42 the United 175 flight crew completed their report on a "suspicious transmission" overheard from another plane (which turned out to have been Flight 11) just after takeoff. This was United 175's last communication with the ground.<n>The hijackers attacked sometime between 8:42 and 8:46. They used knives (as reported by two passengers and a flight attendant), Mace (reported by one passenger), and the threat of a bomb (reported by the same passenger). They stabbed members of the flight crew (reported by a flight attendant and one passenger). Both pilots had been killed (reported by one flight attendant). The eyewitness accounts came from calls made from the rear of the plane, from passengers originally seated further forward in the cabin, a sign that passengers and perhaps crew had been moved to the back of the aircraft. Given similarities to American 11 in hijacker seating and in eyewitness reports of tactics and weapons, as well as the contact between the presumed team leaders, Atta and Shehhi, we believe the tactics were similar on both flights.<n>The first operational evidence that something was abnormal on United 175 came at 8:47, when the aircraft changed beacon codes twice within a minute. At 8:51, the flight deviated from its assigned altitude, and a minute later New York air traffic controllers began repeatedly and unsuccessfully trying to contact it.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt

Before 9/11, it was not unheard of for a commercial aircraft to deviate slightly from its course, or for an FAA controller to lose radio contact with a pilot for a short period of time. A controller could also briefly lose a commercial aircraft's transponder signal, although this happened much less frequently. However, the simultaneous loss of radio and transponder signal would be a rare and alarming occurrence, and would normally indicate a catastrophic system failure or an aircraft crash. In all of these instances, the job of the controller was to reach out to the aircraft, the parent company of the aircraft, and other planes in the vicinity in an attempt to reestablish communications and set the aircraft back on course. Alarm bells would not start ringing until these efforts-which could take five minutes or more-were tried and had failed.<n>NORAD Mission and Structure. NORAD is a binational command established in 1958 between the United States and Canada. Its mission was, and is, to defend the airspace of North America and protect the continent. That mission does not distinguish between internal and external threats; but because NORAD was created to counter the Soviet threat, it came to define its job as defending against external attacks.<n>The threat of Soviet bombers diminished significantly as the Cold War ended, and the number of NORAD alert sites was reduced from its Cold War high of 26. Some within the Pentagon argued in the 1990s that the alert sites should be eliminated entirely. In an effort to preserve their mission, members of the air defense community advocated the importance of air sovereignty against emerging "asymmetric threats" to the United States: drug smuggling, "non-state and state-sponsored terrorists," and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11.<n>At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport.<n>The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words "we have some planes." The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt

The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet.<n>The controller told us that he then knew it was a hijacking. He alerted his supervisor, who assigned another controller to assist him. He redoubled his efforts to ascertain the flight's altitude. Because the controller didn't understand the initial transmission, the manager of Boston Center instructed his quality assurance specialist to "pull the tape" of the radio transmission, listen to it closely, and report back.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
Within minutes of the second impact, Boston Center instructed its controllers to inform all aircraft in its airspace of the events in New York and to advise aircraft to heighten cockpit security. Boston Center asked the Herndon Command Center to issue a similar cockpit security alert nationwide. We have found no evidence to suggest that the Command Center acted on this request or issued any type of cockpit security alert.<n>Military Notification and Response. The first indication that the NORAD air defenders had of the second hijacked aircraft, United 175, came in a phone call from New York Center to NEADS at 9:03. The notice came at about the time the plane was hitting the South Tower.<n>By 9:08, the mission crew commander at NEADS learned of the second explosion at the World Trade Center and decided against holding the fighters in military airspace away from Manhattan:<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
The controller responded, seconds later: "Somebody call Cleveland?"This was followed by a second radio transmission, with sounds of screaming. The Cleveland Center controllers began to try to identify the possible source of the transmissions, and noticed that United 93 had descended some 700 feet. The controller attempted again to raise United 93 several times, with no response. At 9:30, the controller began to poll the other flights on his frequency to determine if they had heard the screaming; several said they had.<n>At 9:32, a third radio transmission came over the frequency:"Keep remaining sitting. We have a bomb on board." The controller understood, but chose to respond: "Calling Cleveland Center, you're unreadable. Say again, slowly." He notified his supervisor, who passed the notice up the chain of command. By 9:34, word of the hijacking had reached FAA headquarters.<n>FAA headquarters had by this time established an open line of communication with the Command Center at Herndon and instructed it to poll all its centers about suspect aircraft. The Command Center executed the request and, a minute later, Cleveland Center reported that "United 93 may have a bomb on board." At 9:34, the Command Center relayed the information concerning United 93 to FAA headquarters. At approximately 9:36, Cleveland advised the Command Center that it was still tracking United 93 and specifically inquired whether someone had requested the military to launch fighter aircraft to intercept the aircraft. Cleveland even told the Command Center it was prepared to contact a nearby military base to make the request. The Command Center told Cleveland that FAA personnel well above them in the chain of command had to make the decision to seek military assistance and were working on the issue.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
Garvey, Belger, and other senior officials from FAA headquarters participated in this video teleconference at various times. We do not know who from Defense participated, but we know that in the first hour none of the personnel involved in managing the crisis did. And none of the information conveyed in the White House video teleconference, at least in the first hour, was being passed to the NMCC. As one witness recalled, "[It] was almost like there were parallel decisionmaking processes going on; one was a voice conference orchestrated by the NMCC . . . and then there was the [White House video teleconference]. . . . [I]n my mind they were competing venues for command and control and decisionmaking."<n>At 10:03, the conference received reports of more missing aircraft, "2 possibly 3 aloft," and learned of a combat air patrol over Washington. There was discussion of the need for rules of engagement. Clarke reported that they were asking the President for authority to shoot down aircraft. Confirmation of that authority came at 10:25, but the commands were already being conveyed in more direct contacts with the Pentagon.<n>The Pentagon Teleconferences. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director for operations immediately thought the second strike was a terrorist attack. The job of the NMCC in such an emergency is to gather the relevant parties and establish the chain of command between the National Command Authority-the president and the secretary of defense- and those who need to carry out their orders.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt

At that point in time, the Langley pilots did not know the threat they were facing, did not know where United 93 was located, and did not have shootdown authorization.<n>First, the Langley pilots were never briefed about the reason they were scrambled. As the lead pilot explained, "I reverted to the Russian threat. . . . I'm thinking cruise missile threat from the sea. You know you look down and see the Pentagon burning and I thought the bastards snuck one by us. . . . [Y]ou couldn't see any airplanes, and no one told us anything." The pilots knew their mission was to divert aircraft, but did not know that the threat came from hijacked airliners.<n>Second, NEADS did not have accurate information on the location of United 93. Presumably FAA would have provided such information, but we do not know how long that would have taken, nor how long it would have taken NEADS to locate the target.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt

The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, (see page 38) is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.<n>The long struggle by Christians to expel the Moors (a campaign known as the Reconquista, or Reconquest) began towards the end of the eighth century a.d. By the 11th century, Portucale consisted of a small section of Castile and León (today’s northern Portugal). Yet it wasn’t until the 12th century that significant gains were made to take back southern Iberia. The beginning of the end came in the Battle of Ourique in 1139. After the victory, Count Afonso Henriques proclaimed himself the first king of Portugal, making it one of the first nation-states in Europe.<n>The Reconquest of Silves, not achieved for another 50 years, was a grisly affair. A mixed bag of Crusaders from northern Europe were recruited en route to their battles east in the Holy Land. They sailed upon the river port of Silves and, ignoring conditional offers of surrender, slew all the inhabitants (at no small loss to themselves) and pillaged the great treasures of the city.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-History.txt
The beginning of the 19th century brought further alarm to the country. This time the epicenter was Paris, and the cause Napoleon. Just as Portugal’s forced alliance with Spain had made the country a target for Drake’s 16th-century raids, now her friendly alliance with England rankled Napoleon.<n>In 1807 the French invaded Lisbon, causing the royal family to flee to Brazil. Spain, followed by Portugal, rose up against the French occupation, in what came to be known as the Peninsular War.<n>Among the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olhão (see page 57). On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It’s said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-History.txt
Following the Reconquest of Iberia by Christians, the Algarve led Portugal to glory and fortune. Prince Henry the Navigator established his legendary Navigation School along Portugal’s southern coast (financing expeditions with royalties from the Algarve fishing industry), and intrepid explorers set out in caravels from Lagos and Sagres. In the 15th and 16th centuries, they ushered in an Age of Discovery, rounding Africa’s Cape of Good Hope and eventually reaching India and the Pacific. Others found their way to the Americas and Brazil. Opening world trade routes across the globe, they established Portugal as a maritime superpower. Spices, gold, and diamonds flowed across the seas to Lisbon.<n>Portugal soon lapsed into decline, though, tattered by wars and constitutional crises, and for two centuries or more the Algarve remained isolated from the rest of Europe. Even though the coast received many illustrious visitors from Roman times through the Middle Ages and up to the Edwardian period (when travelers came to luxuriate in Monchique’s spa waters), the Algarve’s elite vacation status is a relatively recent phenomenon. The first resort on the coast, Praia da Rocha, was only “discovered” in the 1930s, and the real build-up didn’t kick into overdrive until the beginning of the 1980s.<n>Spain’s Costa del Sol developed earlier and more rapidly (and some would say, more disastrously). Yet the lessons of rampant, ill-advised development across the border were not heeded. Only recently has environmental and aesthetic consciousness at least mandated that newer developments be limited to low-rises.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-Intro.txt
Religious Strife<n>Amsterdam was already developing a reputation of tolerance as these new and disparate groups settled into the city. At the same time, Martin Luther’s new Christian doctrine, Protestantism, was spreading like wildfire across Europe. It took a firm foothold in the northern provinces of the Low Countries — with Amsterdam at its heart. It was at this time that Huguenots (French Protestants) came to Amsterdam to flee persecution in their own country.<n>To counter Protestantism the Catholic Spanish instigated the vicious and cruel force of Inquisition. In 1535 there were anti-papacy demonstrations in Dam Square and in 1550 an Edict of Blood was issued by the Spanish to hunt out the heretics. Thus began 80 years of civil strife in Amsterdam and the region of Holland.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-History.txt
There’s no other city on earth like Amsterdam. It is a city of superlatives, having more canals than Venice and more bridges than Paris. It is also one of the prettiest in Europe. The more than 50 museums — featuring everything from the worlds most prominent artists, to the history of hemp — quench the thirst for even the most ardent culture buff, and with 6,000 buildings from the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, the reflections of its illustrious history happily ripple on into the 21st century. However, the lure of Amsterdam’s bricks and mortar is only part of its excitement. Its contemporary culture is vibrant — it’s definitely not a city stuck in the past, and the people are open-minded, easygoing, and opinionated but also down to earth and welcoming to visitors.<n>Amsterdam is situated in the north of The Netherlands and was set where the outlet of the Amstel River meets the salty tidal waters of the Zuider Zee. With little dry land to build on, exactly why a small group of settlers chose this unpromising spot is difficult to understand. Yet it proved to be an excellent decision because Amsterdammers (as the natives of Amsterdam are called) soon came to control the waters of the river, and the trade which flowed along it. By the 17th century, Amsterdam had become arguably the richest city in the world, at the center of a huge Dutch colonial empire. It traded in spices, rum, and sugar cane among other commodities, and its residents demanded only the best. The Amsterdam of this period — called the Golden Age — forms the heart of today’s city.<n>Without doubt, the initial lure of the city is its numerous historic buildings. The lines of tall, narrow houses with their pretty gables rest beside picture-perfect tree-lined canals. They are connected by ornate iron bridges and cobbled walkways, which have changed little for over 300 years, in fact, since they felt the footfall of such inhabitants as the artist Rembrandt and explorer Abel Tasman, who gave his name to Tasmania.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-Intro.txt
In the early 19th century the weigh house closed and Waag had a number of less illustrious tenants; it even spent some time as a furniture store. It now houses a café/bar, so you can have a refreshment and admire the impressive Gothic interior at the same time.<n>Nieuwmarkt (New Market) surrounds the Waag and it is home to several different types of market throughout the week. If you walk to the north side of the Waag and look up the Gelderskade you will see a tower dominating the skyline. This is Schreierstoren, also part of the new city wall of 1480. City scholars are divided as to the reason for the tower’s name. Some say it comes from the word schreien which means “weeping” as it was a place where sailors’ weeping wives came to wave their men off to sea. Other say that the name is a derivation of scherpe, which means “sharp” — denoting the towers position on a 90-degree bend in the wall.<n>From Waag walk down Sint Antoniesbreestraat, past modern apartment blocks built for the workers of the city in the 1970s. On your right you will see the ornate tower of Zuiderkerk (South Church). This church was the first place of worship to be built following the Reformation and was begun in 1603. Designed by Hendrick de Keyser, its lines were much admired by Sir Christopher Wren, architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. It was de-consecrated in 1929 and is now a community information center.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Cross the river via Magere Brug then travel one block north and take a left along the northern bank of the Herengracht Canal. Here you will get your first glimpse of the canal system which was built during Amsterdam’s Golden Age and revolutionized the city. During its time, probably the most sought after and expensive real estate in the world. Herengracht particularly has many beautiful houses which can really only be appreciated by an afternoon strolling by them (see box page 66). This part of town is still mostly residential and many houses have been converted into apartments for successful Amsterdammers. It is fascinating to peek inside at the ultra-modern interiors, which give a feel of the flair the Dutch seem to have for interior design.<n>At number 605 Herengracht, Museum Willet-Holthuysen gives you the opportunity to look behind the façade of a genuine Golden Age house. It was completed in 1690 and structurally has been altered very little since that time, although it has been changed cosmetically several times as fashions changed. In 1855 it came into the possession of the Holthuysen family. Pieter Holthuysen was a successful trader in glass and English coal (which goes to prove that you didn’t need to trade in exotic goods to become wealthy). After the death of Pieter and his wife, the house is bequeathed to their daughter Louisa who later married Abraham Willet. He had a love of art and was a founding member of the Royal Antiquarian Society — a society whose aim was to promote national art and history. On her death in 1895 Louisa bequeathed the house and its contents to the city of Amsterdam on condition that it would be opened as a museum. This it duly did in 1896. You will be able to examine in detail the furniture, porcelain, and numerous artworks collected by the family.<n>Travel further along Herengracht to the end of the second block. Here you will find one of the most fascinating views of the canal ring. From the bridge it is possible to see 14 other bridges by looking up and down Herengracht and ahead down the adjoining Reguliersgracht (this view is even better at water level, so take a canal cruise — and your camera!). Reguliersgracht has some very pretty houses and is quieter than the main three “girdle” canals built at this time.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
The northwest section abuts the center, commencing at Kalverstraat, the rather brash, “happening” shopping street which cuts the center of Amsterdam from north to south. When you reach Spui take a left into a small square — on Fridays you will find a book market here. On the north side of the square you will see a small alleyway which seems to lead between two houses. This is the entrance to the Begijnhof, a haven of peace in the center of the city.<n>The cluster of buildings around a small central square was set aside in 1346 for the benefit of Beguines, members of a lay Catholic sisterhood. They lived simple lives and in return for their lodgings undertook to care for the sick and educate the poor. Although nothing remains of the 14th-century houses, number 34 is Het Houten Huis, Amsterdam’s oldest house, dating from 1488. The Catholic chapel dates from 1680 when it was built in a style to disguise its purpose. The stained glass windows depict the Miracle of Amsterdam. However, in the center of the courtyard is an earlier church now called the English Presbyterian Church. It was rented out to English and Scottish worshippers in 1607 following the Alteration, and the Pilgrim Fathers worshipped here before they set off on their long journey to the New World (they came to Amsterdam from England before they set sail for the New World).<n>The last Beguine died as recently as 1971 and today, although the houses are still offered only to single women of the Christian faith, the women are not expected to undertake lay work.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Downstairs were the offices and warehouses of Mr Frank’s business, which have been recreated in a multimillion dollar development opened in September 1999. Two adjacent buildings have been bought by the museum and refurbished, adding much-needed exhibition and audio-visual space, without compromising number 263 itself. You’ll see videos of Anne’s story and of Amsterdam under occupation along with photographs and artifacts of the time. Anne Frank Huis also acts as an education center and resource for political and philosophical groups fighting oppression in the present day.<n>Cross Prinsengracht to reach the area of the city known as the Jordaan. Built as housing for workers and artisans in the early 17th century it extends roughly from the far bank of Prinsengracht to Lijnbaansgracht, and from Brouwersgracht (Brewers Canal) in the north down to Leidseplein. Many of the streets were named after fragrant flowers but this was not the prettiest or sweetest smelling area of Amsterdam in its heyday. Overcrowding was rife, and with industries such as fabric-dyeing carried out on the ground floors, it was an unsanitary place to live. Its name is said to derive from the French word jardin since a large contingent of French Huguenots came to live here to escape political persecution in their homeland. Today, the Jordaan has been revived and it has become a fashionable residential area. You’ll find many bars, restaurants, and interesting boutiques in the area. It’s a good place to browse for an unusual souvenir of your trip.<n>The outskirts of Amsterdam<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
In ancient Greek mythology Athens is named following a contest between Athena, goddess of wisdom, and Poseidon, god of the sea. Both had their eye on the prize real estate, so it was agreed that whoever could come up with the more useful gift for mortals would win. The half-human, half-serpent king of Athens, Cecrops, acted as arbiter.<n>First came Poseidon, who struck the rock of the Acropolis with his mighty trident and brought salt water gushing forth. Then it was Athena’s turn. As she struck the rock an olive tree appeared, which proved more useful and valuable. Thus she acquired the position of the city’s special protector.<n>The actual history of the city-state of Athens is just as fascinating as its mythology. From around 2000 b.c. wandering bands filtered into Greece from Asia Minor. Known as Achaeans, they were the first Greek-speaking people in the area, and over the centuries they built many imposing fortresses and developed the rich Mycenaean civilization, based in the Peloponnese. The citadel at Mycenae, seat of this most powerful of early Greek cultures, was erected to the south of Athens. Surrounded by a pair of precipitous ravines, the imposing walls of the citadel were some forty feet high and twenty feet thick, virtually impregnable.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-History.txt
Theoretically sovereign, the new state was an artificial creation — the result of pressure from other European powers — and the 17-year-old Bavarian Prince Otto was installed as king. He was deposed in 1862, but during his reign Athens slowly returned to being a city again, and Greece made considerable economic progress.<n>As a result of complex European diplomatic talks, a second adolescent came to the Greek throne in 1863, the 18-year-old William of the Danish royal house Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glückburg. He took the name George I, King of the Hellenes, and remained in power for 50 years until his assassination in 1913.<n>The 20th Century<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-History.txt
After all the exploration of these fascinating archaeological sites, you’ll probably be ready for a rest and change of scenery. As you make your way to the city you’ll pass through two small districts which offer a range of cafés, bars, and tavernas, along with images of Greek daily life not found in more modern parts of Athens.<n>The tiny area called Anafiotika hugs the high ground immediately below the Acropolis. Built in the 19th century for migrant workers from around Greece that came to take advantage of construction opportunities in the capital, the first few families came from the island of Anafi and wanted to create surroundings that would remind them of home. Today the narrow lanes with their neat, whitewashed, cottages and plethora of potted geraniums are still reminiscent of the Aegean settlements across the water.<n>Plaka lies below Anafiotika and fills the space between the ancient and modern city, stretching to Odós Ermou and Syntagma Square to the north. This was the center of population from Byzantine times through to Greek independence, and thus can be called Athens Old Town. The maze of narrow — mostly traffic-free — streets is a delight to explore and there are numerous shops and eateries to choose from. Playful cats dart down the narrow alleyways, and you may be lucky to hear the Terpsichordean notes of the laterna drifting through the streets — these hand-turned barrel organs are now becoming extremely rare. Plaka is particularly atmospheric in the evenings when locals enjoy a volta, or stroll, before dinner and tavernas set tables out on the narrow side streets. It is almost a living museum with Byzantine Churches, Neo-Classical mansions housing galleries or collectibles stores, and a wealth of historical detail at every turn. Do look beyond the tempting shop fronts to really get the most out of your tour. Though you’ll want to simply follow your nose around the district, here are the locations of the main historical attractions of Plaka.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
In ancient times Corinth rivaled Athens in its power and influence. It mimicked the layout of the larger city — a town radiated out from the base of a rocky pinnacle that housed religious temples — though at Corinth the hill is much higher than at Athens.<n>The site was first settled by Mycenaeans because it had an excellent natural water supply, and it reached its first level of prosperity around the seventh century b.c. It became Athens’ enemy when it sided with the Spartans during the devastating wars of the fourth century b.c. but the city recovered quickly from the defeat and had a second period of influence that began during the third century b.c. when Philip of Macedonia made it the capital of the Corinthian League. In 195 b.c. it became head of a group of independent Greek cities of the Achaean League. Ravaged by the Romans in 170 b.c. it rose again from the ashes and was a bustling city when St. Paul came to preach here. He won more support than in Athens and planted the seeds of a very successful early Christian church. Several major earthquakes in the early Christian era saw the city’s final decline.<n>Luckily for us the modern city of Corinth lies several kilometers to the northeast of the site and this leaves much of the ancient city for us to explore. Most prominent as you approach the site is the Temple of Apollo built in the sixth century b.c. and one of the oldest buildings in Corinth. Many other remains date from the Roman era, including ornate entrances round the Fountain of Peirene where you can still hear the waters flowing through caves at the rear, and the Lechaion Road that linked the city to Athens — with worn cart tracks clearly visible in the marble slabs. The site museum has some interesting finds and has a number of dioramas depicting Corinth as it would once have looked.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
The Spaniards never bothered to settle in the Bahamas, but the number of shipwrecks attest that their galleons frequently passed through the archipelago en route to and from the Caribbean, Florida, Bermuda, and their home ports. On Eleuthera the explorers dug a fresh-water well — at a spot now known as “Spanish Wells” — which was used to replenish the supplies of water on their ships before they began the long journey back to Europe with their cargoes of South American gold. As for the Lucayans, within 25 years all of them, perhaps some 30,000 people, were removed from the Bahamas to work — and die — in Spanish gold mines and on farms and pearl fisheries on Hispaniola (Haiti), Cuba, and elsewhere in the Caribbean.<n>English sea captains also came to know the beautiful but deserted Bahamian islands during the 17th century. England’s first formal move was on 30 October 1629, when Charles I granted the Bahamas and a chunk of the American south to his Attorney General, Sir Robert Health. But nothing came of that, nor of a rival French move in 1633 when Cardinal Richelieu, the 17th-century French statesman, tried claiming the islands for France.<n>Colonization and Piracy<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-History.txt
As the colonies’ war effort picked up steam, both France and Spain weighed in against the British. In May 1782, New Providence surrendered to a large Spanish-American invasion fleet from Cuba and for the next year a Spanish governor ruled the Bahamas.<n>News traveled slowly in those days. The Treaty of Versailles in 1783 formally restored the Bahamas to the British, but actual liberation came through a famous escapade that would never have happened in the age of the telegraph. Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Deveaux, a loyalist from South Carolina, sailed from Florida with six ships, picked up men and fishing boats at Harbour Island and Eleuthera, and “invaded” Nassau. Though vastly outnumbered and outgunned, Deveaux employed elaborate ruses with his little boats to convince the Spanish defenders that his force was overpowering. The humiliating Spanish surrender is proudly recalled in Bahamian history, even though it was all unnecessary: the peace treaty had been signed the previous week.<n>Deveaux was the first of some 7,000 loyalists who, with slaves and the promise of land grants, came to the Bahamas from the southern American colonies in the wake of the English defeat in the Revolutionary War. This influx profoundly affected the islands. A number of prominent Bahamians today are the descendants of loyalists or their slaves. As a reward for his efforts, Deveaux was given acreage on both New Providence and Cat Island. Other loyalists set up cotton plantations on various islands, and slaves soon became the majority of the population.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-History.txt

Liquor money bought Nassau better houses, churches, lighting, water, roads, sewers, docks, and hotels. The city’s first gambling casino opened in 1920; the first daily air service from Miami began in 1929; the yacht set decided Nassau was fashionable, and many wealthy Americans as well as Prohibition millionaires built homes on the islands.<n>When the boom suddenly came to an end with the worldwide depression and the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, unemployment rose again, despite the first significant tourism the Bahamas had known.<n>In some respects, World War II put the Bahamas on the international map. The colony was chosen to have two of the sites Britain leased to the United States under Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “destroyers for bases” deal in 1940. Allied forces operated submarine-hunting and air-sea rescue stations on the islands; Royal Air Force pilots and Royal Navy frogmen were trained here, and much trans-Atlantic air traffic passed through the Bahamas.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-History.txt
The Bahamas islands are the flattened peaks of a huge ancient mountain range that once towered many thousands of feet into the sky. They now lie low in the water, the highest point — Mount Alvernia on Cat Island — being only 206 ft (65 m) above sea level. The eastern coastlines of the islands break the long tidal fetch that travels across the Atlantic; on the sheltered western coastline, coral outcrops have produced vast shallow sand banks that reflect waters of myriad translucent blues and greens.<n>Indeed, it was these characteristic shallow banks that gave the Bahamas islands their name. When Spanish explorers came to map the area in the 16th century, they named the area baja mar, or shallow seas, as a warning to the galleons that would be sailing through the waters. The name was later anglicized and the Bahamas were born.<n>The warning on Spanish maps unfortunately did little to stop ships from running aground or foundering on the treacherous shoals; even today treasure lost centuries ago is still being discovered and salvaged.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-Intro.txt
Bimini<n>Two tiny islands only 9 sq miles (23 sq km) in total area, North and South Bimini lie just 50 miles (80 km) east of Miami in the midst of some of the best sport fishing waters in the world. Both have had an illustrious list of admirers. Ponce de Leon searched for the Fountain of Youth here. Ernest Hemingway spent a lot of time fishing and writing here — photographs of this prominent visitor still adorn the walls of the Compleat Angler Hotel, where he wrote To Have and Have Not. American politician Adam Clayton Powell, who was regularly seen at the marina of Alice Town, the major settlement, helped raise the profile of the place in the eyes of Americans. The islands flourished during the years of American Prohibition, when many came here to enjoy a shot or two of hard liquor.<n>Alice Town with its bars and hotels is still the center of the action. A series of fishing competitions make up a “season” for the rich, bright, and beautiful, who descend to fish during the day and enjoy the lively social scene after dark. Although Bimini does not have the casinos and stage shows of Nassau and Grand Bahama, the Hemingway legacy seems to keep the bars along the quay in a perpetual state of jovial excess. Offshore in only 15 ft (41⁄2 m) of water, lies the famed ancient roadway said to be part of the lost city of Atlantis.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
Greater Miami<n>Miami is America’s youngest big city. Development began only in 1896, when the Florida East Coast railroad was extended to the region. In the 1920s the region began to attract wealthy Americans from the north, who came to escape the cold winters. Since Castro’s revolution in Cuba greater Miami has welcomed millions of Cuban and other Latin American settlers. The area has strong trading links with South and Central America and the Caribbean. Today cruise ships, yachts, fishing boats, and freighters keep the waterfront humming while traffic never ceases along the futuristic network of expressways; and Miami’s sprawling international airport is one of the busiest in the US.<n>Miami is alive with energy. A fusion of styles has put the city at the forefront of American art, dance, music, and cuisine. Downtown, the Bayside shopping center has revitalized the docks area. Chain stores and craft stalls sit alongside cafés and bars, and on weekends there’s live music on stage at the center’s main plaza.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
A Brief History<n>Today’s Indonesians mainly descend from people who came from south China via the Malay peninsula and moved along the island chain to Java, Bali, Lombok, and beyond, from 3000 to 1000 b.c. Archaeological finds show that there was a flourishing Bronze Age culture in Bali and Lombok between about 1000 and 100 b.c. Trade and cultural exchanges with Southeast Asia had certainly begun by that period, and there were frequent contacts with India by a.d. 100. About this time, too, wet rice cultivation was introduced to Bali, changing the face of the countryside to its present appearance of rice paddy fields and terraces.<n>Indian traders and teachers brought Buddhism to Java. It had only a limited influence in Bali, however, where people continued in their ancient animist beliefs, worshipping the spirits of the mountains, rivers, and other natural forces.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-History.txt
A powerful Hindu empire named after its capital, Majapahit, united all of Java by 1320. The Majapahit general Gajah Mada reconquered Bali in 1343, and annexed a large part of the Indonesian archipelago. Hindu art and scholarship spread through the islands, but on most of the islands, this flowering was short-lived. With the death in 1389 of King Hayam Wurukin, its last great ruler, the empire of Majapahit began to decline.<n>Muslim traders and teachers had already started converting several of Java’s princes and people to Islam, especially in coastal areas, and in the 14th and 15th centuries the movement spread to the interior. By the year 1500, seeing their world breaking up, many Majapahit aristocrats, priests, and scholars fled to Bali, where their culture continued to flourish. Islam never gained a strong foothold in Bali, which was difficult to invade because of its many reefs and lack of harbors, and had few products to attract traders. The early 16th century also brought the first European ships to Indonesian waters, when the Portuguese came in search of spices and set up trading posts — though not on Bali.<n>In 1550 Bali was united under Batu Renggong, the formidable ruler known as Dewa Agung (god-king) of Gelgel, near Klungkung. His men even succeeded in turning back the tide of Islam for a short while, adding eastern Java and Lombok to his domains. During his rule, Balinese power, culture, and influence reached a peak, with a boom in temple building and the associated crafts of sculpture and woodcarving.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-History.txt
During the rest of the 19th century, the Dutch, using the rajas and other aristocrats as regents, took control over most of Bali, but their influence in the south remained limited. This was emphasized in 1904 when a ship wrecked off Sanur was plundered of its cargo. The Dutch demanded reparations for this act; the southern rajas refused. In 1906 a force of mainly Moluccan troops led by Dutch officers marched on Denpasar to enforce compliance. They found the place almost deserted, until suddenly the Raja of Badung, together with his family and hundreds of courtiers, emerged from the palace. On a signal from the raja, one of his priests stabbed him with a kris (knife), and then, pausing only to stab their children first, the rest of the royal party began a puputan, either killing themselves or running suicidally towards the enemy. When the dreadful scene was repeated by the Dewa Agung and his wives and followers in 1908 in front of the palace at Klungkung, the rajas’ resistance to Dutch rule was at an end.<n>The public in the Netherlands was appalled by these grisly events. From then on, Bali and the Balinese came to be looked on as unique — to be protected from the colonial treatment that had turned the other islands into plantations exploited for profit. Tourism was discouraged, although a few foreigners did make the journey and returned to the outside world with news of the island’s extraordinary culture. An American couple, Bob and Louise Koke, opened the first hotel on Kuta Beach in 1936; Louise G. Koke’s memoir, Our Hotel In Bali, provides an idyllic portrait of Bali’s first, tenuous endeavor at tourism from 1936 until the Japanese invasion in 1942.<n>During the 1920s and 1930s, Cokorde Gde Agung Sukawati, ruler of Ubud, extended a long Sukawati family tradition of patronizing talent and craftsmanship by hosting visiting Western artists, including the German painter, Walter Spies, who stayed for 14 years. Spies’ influence revolutionized painting in Bali, which had previously been one of the least inventive of Bali’s arts, bound by repetitive conventions. The Pita Maha school of young Western-influenced artists emerged (also influenced by the Dutch pastel-ist, Rudolf Bonnet), putting Ubud on the world map of contemporary art. Spies’ house and spring-fed swimming pool (now part of the Tjampuhan Hotel) were visited by Western artists, academics, musicians, and stars of theater and film. Deeply involved in Balinese culture, Spies himself choreographed the still-performed version of the most famous Balinese dance, the kecak, based on a story from the “Ramayana.” When Germany invaded Holland in 1940, Spies was interned as an enemy alien. He died in 1942, when a ship on which he was being transported to British Ceylon was torpedoed by the Japanese.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-History.txt
Just inland, parallel to the beach, the town of Sanur looks at first like nothing more than a long strip of souvenir shops, clothing boutiques, and restaurants. But take a walk along some of the lanes leading off the main road, Jalan Tanjung Sari, or beyond the impatient traffic of the bypass (Jalan Bypass) and you’ll find traditional life still going on as if tourism had never happened. Many small Indonesian and seafood restaurants on the street are pleasant; one or two are outstanding. Sanur hotels provide the best top-bracket dining.<n>Only a short walk north along the shore from the ten-story Grand Bali Beach Hotel is the Le Mayeur Museum, once the house of the Belgian painter, Adrien Jean Le Mayeur. He came to Bali in 1932 and stayed to marry the beautiful Ni Pollok, who had been a well-known legong dancer (see page 88) before retiring (at 14!) to teach dance. In its day, the garden with its ponds and statues was open on the seaward side; now it is fully enclosed. The outside of the house is covered with stone carvings while the interior is a gallery of sculpture collected by Le Mayeur. The walls are hung with his own paintings: European landscapes, Balinese scenes, and studies of dancers, including Ni Pollok. When Le Mayeur died in 1958, the house was turned into a museum that his widow ran until her death in 1985.<n>Near the small harbor at this end of Sanur Beach you can find motorized prahu (outrigger boats) to take you to Nusa Lembongan, an island 17 km (11 miles) offshore to the east, which is noted for its good surfing and snorkeling.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
At the western end of town, an old suspension bridge and a new road bridge cross the Campuhan river. On the north side of the ravine is the temple of Pura Gunung Labah, which may date from the 8th century a.d., possibly making it one of Bali’s earliest. Shrouded in dense vegetation, it overlooks Goa Raksasa, a cave named after the evil giant who is said to have dwelt there.<n>Just north of the Campuhan bridges, the Tjampuhan Hotel (the same place-name but with the old spelling) stands where Walter Spies (see page 53) came to live in the 1930s. Across the road and up the hill, stone stairs lead to rice paddies and the track to the home of the Young Artists group at Penestanan. At neighboring Sayan, Westerners have built their homes overlooking the rice terraces and spectacular Ayung gorge.<n>The road from Campuhan past the Museum Neka leads to the town of Kedewatan, where the most luxurious hotels in the area compete to offer similarly stunning views into the Ayung valley. Beyond Payangan, the little-used road wends its way through scenic countryside all the way to Batur (see page 59).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
The hillside gardens and lake at Narmada, 10 km (6 miles) east of Cakranegara, were laid out for a 19th-century raja to remind him of Gunung Rinjani and its crater lake when he became too infirm to make the journey to the real mountain. The resemblance is harder to see now that an extra pool and a rectangular swimming pool have been added.<n>To the north of Narmada at Lingsar, a new spring is said to have burst into life to greet the Balinese when they came to Lombok, and they chose the site for an ecumenical temple intended to bring together people of different religions. The upper compound is reserved for the Hindus. The pool in the Wektu Telu temple is the home of big plump eels, overfed on offerings of boiled eggs which are conveniently sold by vendors at the gate. In another enclosure, the stones wound in white cloth with a yellow sash come from Gunung Rinjani, and Chinese Taoists have put mirrors there to repel the malevolent spirits.<n>At Suranadi, in the gardens just east of Lingsar, eggs are on the menu again, for the residents of a pond in the Temple of the Holy Eels. You can swim, too, in a separate spring-fed pool or at the old Dutch-built hotel. You can also play golf at the nearby country club.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
In 1640, with Spain and France at war, Catalonia declared itself an independent republic, allied to Philip IV’s enemy France. After the French defeat in 1652, the Catalan territories north of the Pyrenees were delivered to France, fixing the border where it is today. The ensuing years were rife with constant wars, shifting alliances, and disputes over succession to the crown. In all of these conflicts, Barcelona automatically sided with whomever opposed Madrid, and usually ended up the loser.<n>The worst of these episodes came in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1713) between the backers of Philip of Anjou, the 17-year-old grandson of Louis XIV of France, and the Hapsburg claimant, Archduke Charles of Austria. Charles was enthusiastically received when he landed in Catalonia, but Philip, supported by France, won the war and became the first Bourbon ruler as Philip V. After a 13-month siege, on 11 September 1714, the royal army captured and sacked Barcelona. The Catalan Generalitat was dissolved and the city’s privileges were abolished. The Ciutadella fortress was built to keep the populace subdued, and official use of the Catalan language was outlawed. Catalonia celebrates this defeat as its national holiday, a symbol of the spirit of nationalist resistance.<n>Discord within the Spanish government or conflict with foreign powers frequently served as an excuse for Catalan separatists to rise up, though their rebellions were usually summarily quashed. From 1808 to 1814, Spain again became a battleground, with British forces taking on Napoleon’s troops in the Peninsular War. Napoleon attacked and destroyed Catalonia’s sacred shrine, the monastery at Montserrat.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-History.txt
On the right side of La Rambla is the old Hotel Oriente, which preserves part of the 17th century cloister of a Franciscan school inside. Note the naïve painted angels floating over the doorway at Hemingway’s favorite Barcelona lodging. Just beyond the hotel on the carrer Nou de la Rambla, 3, is Palau Güell, the mansion Gaudí (see page 50) built in 1885 for his principal patron, the textile tycoon Count Eusebi Güell. This meticulously detailed, fortress-like home, a study in high Gothic, is now open for guided tours. Visitors get to see the fabulously tiled rooftop chimneys, which were hidden from view for decades.<n>Returning to the Ramblas, cross over and follow the short passage that leads into the arcaded Plaça Reial. This handsome and spacious square is graced with a fountain, palm trees, and wrought-iron lamp-posts designed by the young Gaudí. Like the Boquería, the Hotel Oriente, and other Rambla landmarks, this square came into being as a result of the destruction of a convent, when church properties were expropriated in an anti-clerical period in the mid-19th century. Not long ago it was the stomping grounds of junkies and petty thieves, but it has been since revitalized and is flush with bars, cafés, and restaurants.<n>The final promenade leading down to the harbor is the short Rambla de Santa Mònica, beginning at the Plaça del Teatre, site of the run-down Teatre Principal. Though the Centre d’Art Santa Mònica puts on fine contemporary art exhibits, the area continues to be the beat of prostitutes and cops, pickpockets, and bag-snatchers. The warren of alleys to the right is the once-notorious Barri Xino, or Chinatown. With the new openness of the post-Franco era it has lost much of its seedy interest, but it’s still not the best place for a midnight stroll.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
For all of Barcelona’s exuberant architecture, the city’s modern district is a model of rationalist urban planning, a rigid geometric grid dryly called “the Extension.” The outrageous and conservative, one learns, coexist here without much fuss.<n>Barcelona’s expansion came about in a remarkable burst of urban development. By the mid-1800s Barcelona was bursting at the seams and suffocating inside its ring of medieval walls. A municipal competition was held in 1859 to select a plan for a new quarter between the old city and the Collserola hills. The job went to a road engineer named Ildefons Cerdà, whose plan quintupled the city’s size in a matter of decades. Eixample construction by elite Barcelonans transformed the city into a showcase of extravagant modernista architecture, and the swank Passeig de Gràcia became the place to be seen. Barcelona used the 1888 Universal Exposition as an open house to show the world its new face.<n>The place to begin a modernista tour is definitely on Passeig de Gracia and its single, hallucinatory block popularly known as Manzana de la Discordia (“Block of Discord”) between Consell de Cent and Aragó. (In Spanish the word for “apple” and “street block” are the same  — manzana — allowing for a play on words alluding to the apple in Greek mythology, which was awarded to the most beautiful among three goddesses — a contest that led inevitablyto trouble.)<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
Montjuïc was the natural site for the 1992 Olympic Ring (Anella Olímpica) of athletic facilities. For many years its 210-meter (689-foot) summit, panoramic view of the city and harbor, and outstanding complex of museums, amusement attractions, and sports facilities have made the hill a favorite place to spend an afternoon.<n>Montjuïc came into its own as the site of Barcelona’s 1929 International Exhibition. The Plaça d’Espanya’s ornate fountain was created to grace the entrance to the fairground and is still a good point to begin a visit to Montjuïc, as it has a metro and bus stop. A number of hangar-type halls used during the year by commercial exhibitors at fairs line a central pedestrian avenue leading upwards to the vast Palau Nacional, the fair’s Spanish pavilion.<n>This domed palace holds one of the world’s finest collections of medieval art, the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya. Unmatched for Romanesque art and Gothic painting of the Catalan school, it has undergone extensive refurbishment over recent years, and the section on Romanesque art is now finally reopened. From the ninth to the 13th centuries, more than 2,000 churches were built in Catalonia in the Romanesque style of thick, bare walls with rounded arches for doors, windows, and cloisters. Interiors were decorated with frescoes in the Byzantine tradition; primitive sculpture of biblical episodes or rural life on the capitals of columns; painted altar front panels; carved wooden crosses, and Madonnas of great purity. Around the start of the 20th century many of these works of art were removed to Catalan museums from churches that were deteriorating or abandoned, thus saving them from further damage or being sold out of the country.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
The German capital became a municipality during the 1200s, ironically as a divided city. In those days the two rival halves were in no rush to unite. The fishermen of Cölln, whose name survives in the modern borough of Neukölln, lived on an island in the River Spree. The townships that comprise the modern Mitte district grew up around market places over which the people’s churches, the Nikolaikirche and Marienkirche, still tower today. With the fortress of Burg Köpenick providing a common defense to the south, Cölln and Berlin formed a trade center between Magdeburg and Poznan.<n>In a region inhabited by the Slavonic Sorbs, the population of the city was overwhelmingly German by the 13th century, comprising enterprising merchants hailing from the northern Rhineland, Westphalia, and Lower Saxony, with latecomers from Thuringia and the Harz. Berlin and Cölln came together in 1307 in order to lead the Brandenburg region’s defenses and defeat the robber barons who were terrorizing merchants and local peasants. The prosperous city joined the Hanseatic League, trading in rye, wool, and oak timber and providing an entrepôt for skins and furs from eastern Europe. Apparently living was easy in the 15th century, as historian Trithemius noted: “Life here consists of nothing but eating and drinking.”<n>Berlin continued as a virtually autonomous outpost of the German empire until 1448, when Brandenburg’s Kurfürst (Prince Elector) Friedrich II took over control of the city after crushing the citizens’ violent resistance, the so-called Berliner Unwillen. He was a member of the Hohenzollern dynasty that was to hold sway here for over 450 years.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt
In the autumn of 1938, Hitler was put out that Berliners did not share his enthusiasm for the cavalcade of troops driving through the city. The army was preparing its march into what used to be Czechoslovakia, but onlookers shared none of the fervor that had greeted military parades in 1914.<n>Their disquiet was shortly to be justified by the hail of bombs on the capital. The first attacks came in 1940 from the British in retaliation for the air raids on London. Attacks were stepped up after the German defeat at Stalingrad in 1943, with Anglo-American “carpet-bombing.” The worst single raid was on 6 February 1945, when bombs wiped out 4 sq km (1 1⁄2 sq miles) of the city center in one hour.<n>Hitler spent the last days of the war in his bunker at the Reich chancellery. As Soviet troops moved in to capture the city, he killed himself with a shot through the mouth.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt
The erection of the Wall did significantly reduce the flow of refugees to a few isolated escapes, but the East German economy suffered even more from the assaults of massive mismanagement and high-level corruption. Erich Honecker’s regime won international diplomatic recognition for East Berlin as its capital and, with gleaming hotels and skyscrapers, tried to give it a lustre to rival West Berlin. Beneath the surface, however, the drabness of daily life and lack of personal freedom continued to undermine any chance of popular support.<n>The final push which led to the collapse of the Berlin Wall came when an ecological campaign in Leipzig against nuclear weapons and industrial pollution grew into nationwide pressure for democratic freedom. In 1989, with thousands of East Germans fleeing to the West via Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, the country was swept up in the wave of eastern European revolutions unleashed by the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. His visit to East Berlin in October 1989 for the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic left it clear that Soviet troops would no longer shore up its regime. The Berlin Wall was opened on 9 November 1989, and at midnight on 3 October 1990, a huge black, red, and gold national flag was hoisted at the Reichstag. East and West Berlin were again one.<n>The City Today<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt
The gate itself, designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, was built between 1789 and 1791. With two rows of six Doric columns forming the gateway proper, it was inspired by the Propylaeum gatehouse leading to the Parthenon in Athens. (To go all the way, Hitler had even planned to hoist the gate onto an artificial hill, in an attempt to create a mini-Acropolis.) Forming part of the city wall, the gate was intended by the more pragmatic Prussians not so much as a triumphal arch as an imposing tollgate for collecting duties.<n>The gate was left isolated in no-man’s land when the Wall went up, and subsequently became the scene of quite ecstatic celebrations when it came down, though now you would scarcely believe it as Berliners cross nonchalantly from east to west through Brandenburg’s mighty central arch.<n>The new US Embassy is being built nearby, on land originally occupied by that country’s pre-war embassy, and a large stretch of ground leading towards Potsdamer Platz has been designated as the site of a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
Isolated from London by more than 5,300 km (3,300 miles) in an age of slow communications, Bermuda sometimes found itself out of step with developments in the homeland. In 1649, the islanders were appalled to learn of the execution of Charles I and the proclamation of Cromwell’s Commonwealth. They later rejoiced when Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660.<n>Another era ended in 1684 when the Bermuda Company lost its charter. After a five-year legal battle, Bermuda became a British colony with a degree of self-government. The authorities in London appointed a Governor to act as the crown representative (this is still the system today). The most difficult test of Bermuda’s loyalties came when the American colonies rose in rebellion against George III. London forbade Bermuda to trade with or otherwise support General Washington’s revolutionaries. This was a heartbreaking decree for the islanders to obey in light of Bermuda’s close personal and family ties with the people of Virginia and other American colonies. Commerce also provided a strong rationale for helping the rebels, for Bermuda received most of its grain from the North American colonies. Simply put, Bermuda needed food and George Washington needed gunpowder.<n>On a dark night in mid-August 1775, several boats sailed into the dark harbor of Tobacco Bay near Fort St. Catherine and, in a daring and dangerous raid, stole 100 kegs of gunpowder from the main ordnance store. Once safely on the boats, the ammunition made its way to the rebel forces. To this day nobody knows if this was part of an orchestrated campaign or simply a spur-of-the-moment action by local sympathizers. But Bermuda got its grain. The British authorities were horrified but could find no conclusive proof of guilt. The Tuckers, a prominent family with many connections to the American revolutionaries, were the prime suspects. Not all Bermudians, however, were sympathetic to the rebel cause, as privateers continued to capture and ransack American ships.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-history.txt
Returning to Ferry Point junction, take the north fork to St. George’s town. You’ll travel around the far side of Mullet Bay — a sheltered natural harbor for small craft — and then past a children’s play area before reaching the outskirts of town. (St. George’s can be reached via bus routes #1, #3, #10, and #11.)<n>Set in the far northeast portion of Bermuda, St. George’s is the island’s oldest town and the historic heartland of the colony. Sir George Somers and his brave band of settlers were heading for Virginia in 1609 when they were shipwrecked on reefs just offshore from here. They were surprised by the natural riches that Bermuda had to offer, as the island had good cedar wood to build more ships. Out of adversity came good fortune, and the settlers soon built two new ships and sailed from Bermuda to complete their original goal of reaching Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda the following year but died here before he could develop the town further.<n>The settlers who founded the town in 1615 created a basic grid pattern that has remained unchanged. The lanes in town are wide enough for a horse and carriage, but no wider. They retain their original names, some with reference to local characters and activities such as Printer’s Alley and Aunt Peggy’s Lane. Main streets such as Queen Street and Duke of York Street recall the monarchs and individuals important to the British Crown. Take time to wander along the narrow lanes — beyond the noise of contemporary Bermuda — where you can imagine yourself back in the 16th and 17th centuries. The town is small, so it is difficult to lose your way. As you walk, you will find many historic houses and museums providing many more clues to the lives of these fascinating people.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
At the top of King Street is State House, built in the 1620s to house Bermuda’s Assembly. Today it is the oldest stone building on the island. The plain façade and sturdy walls were designed to withstand hurricanes and the worst of the summer humidity. It was used continuously until 1815, when the island’s capital was moved from St. George’s to Hamilton. The local Masonic lodge negotiated with the Assembly to use the building, with a rent of one peppercorn per year, a price that remains in force to this day. The “peppercorn” rent is handed over to the crown in one of the most ornate ceremonial occasions of the year, with the mayor and town officials in full official regalia.<n>Water Street leads away from King’s Square to the west. It has many shops selling tax-free goods; the modern shops occupy space in much older buildings. Wander along the traffic-free thoroughfare to do some leisurely souvenir hunting. On your right, watch for Tucker House Museum, which was from 1775 the home of Henry Tucker, the President of the Governor’s Council. The Tuckers were one of the most influential families on Bermuda, the first family member having arrived on the island in 1616. In 1950, a descendant — an American named Robert Tucker — bequeathed many family heirlooms to the house in his will. The kitchen area, originally separated from the main house, was once a barbershop operated by Henry Raine, a black man who came to Bermuda to escape the worst of the American Civil War. Once the war was over, he and his family returned to the US, where he became the first black member elected to the House of Representatives.<n>Across the street is the Carriage Museum. Until the 1940s, horses and carriages were the only modes of transportation permitted along the narrow Bermuda roads, and almost every well-to-do family had a horse-drawn vehicle. However, these disappeared almost immediately following a relaxation of the strict rules that had kept motor vehicles off the island. This collection of beautiful carriages celebrates those “gone-but-not-forgotten” days.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
At School and Washington streets, the lovely red-brick building with a Dutch gambrel roof was built in 1718 as an apothecary shop on the site of Anne Hutchinson’s residence. In the 19th century it became a literary light when Ticknor and Fields, the publisher of Emerson, Longfellow, and Thoreau operated here from 1832 to 1865 and when the Atlantic Monthly was the most famous magazine of the day. Today the Globe Corner Bookstore sells memorabilia and souvenirs associated with the Boston Globe and the city. Across the street stands a moving monument to the two million Irish immigrants who fled starvation and oppression crossing “the bowl of tears” to seek a better life in Boston.<n>Diagonally opposite, stands the Old South Meeting House (1729). Here on 16 December, 1773, 5,000 colonists came to protest the tea tax. They listened to Samuel Adams and then marched down to the docks and dumped 123,000 pounds of tea into the harbor (see page 15). Ben Franklin was baptized here, and black poet Phyllis Wheatley worshiped here. During the occupation of Boston, the English desecrated the church ripping out the pews and using it as a riding school. Today it’s been restored and visitors can enjoy an audio presentation about the great controversies that have been aired here.<n>Continue up Washington Street, into the heart of the Downtown shopping area (see page 80). Here the Freedom Trail doubles back on itself to the Old State House (1713), a red-brick building with a wedding cake bell tower. The surrounding buildings dwarf it. It was the British Government’s headquarters in Boston and also served as the merchants’ exchange and after the revolution as the state capitol. Here James Otis argued against the Writs of Assistance; the Declaration of Independence was read from the balcony on 18 July, 1776. The gold lion and silver unicorn above, symbols of the British crown, are replicas of originals that were destroyed that same day. Inside, displays and historical artifacts relate Boston’s Revolutionary history. Other exhibits concentrate on later events, like the first attempt to integrate the schools in 1848.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
Early Settlers<n>The settlement of present-day Hungary goes far back in time. Less than 64 km (40 miles) to the west of Budapest, human traces thought to be half a million years old have been excavated and are now on display at the Hungarian National Museum. The ﬁrst tribes that came to this area brought skills and tools which improved the lot of the hunter, made farming feasible, and, in time, gave rise to primitive industries.<n>Around the third century b.c., Hungary was occupied by a Celtic-Illyrian tribe known as Eraviscans, refugees from wars in Greece. They established a tribal centre on top of Gellért Hill and continued the early settlers’ artistic and industrial innovations.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-History.txt
The Angevin Dynasty<n>The Arpád dynasty ended in 1301; the French House of Angevin (Anjou), in the shape of Károly (Charles) Róbert, claimed the crown. He moved the court to Visegrád before it came permanently to Buda’s Castle Hill.<n>Two more foreign kings ruled after Róbert, but it was a Hungarian noble, János Hunyadi, who was to become the national saviour in the mid-15th century. The Turks had been threatening the country for some time but Hunyadi led the Hungarian army to victory against them at Nándorfehérvár (now Belgrade) in 1456.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-History.txt
Meanwhile the Turks were again massing for war. This time there was no Hunyadi to lead the weakened nation, and the king, Lajos (Louis) II, and much of his army were killed at the battle of Mohács (in southern Hungary) in 1526.<n>The neighbouring Austrian Habsburg rulers, fearful that Vienna would be the Ottoman empire’s next conquest, proclaimed themselves rulers of Hungary, thus creating a buffer zone between themselves and the Turks. Hungary was effectively dismembered: the north and west fell to the Habsburgs; Transylvania became a so-called independent principality under Turkish auspices; and central Hungary came under direct Turkish rule. The Turks ﬁnally occupied Buda in 1541 and stayed there for almost a century and a half, achieving and bequeathing little of note except, of course, their baths.<n>By the late 17th century the Christian armies of the West were fully mobilized against the Ottoman inﬁdels. Long, devastating sieges were laid to both Buda and Pest and, when ﬁnally liberated in 1686, the cities once again lay in ruins.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-History.txt
Hitler’s Germany, meanwhile, provided investment in Hungarian industry and a market for Hungarian farm produce, and earned a grudging admiration from the Hungarians for its deﬁance of the World War I allies. In 1940 Hungary allowed the German army to cross its territory and, as a reward, they temporarily recovered parts of its former lands from Romania and Yugoslavia. It was a false dawn before the country’s blackest hours. Thousands of Hungarians died supporting the Germans on the Russian Front, and just as Horthy thought he could squirm out of Hitler’s grasp by declaring neutrality in 1944, the country was occupied by the Germans.<n>As the Soviet army moved closer to Budapest in late 1944 and the bombing of the city became more intense, Horthy played his last card by declaring an armistice. The Germans responded by installing in power a Hungarian fascist group called the Arrow Cross. This brutal, fanatical regime murdered hundreds of Budapestis and ensured further destruction of the city by ﬁghting the Red Army to the death. By the time the Russians ﬁnally took Budapest, three-quarters of its buildings were demolished and the Hungarian death toll in the war came to about half a million.<n>In and Out of the Red<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-History.txt
The first Americans to come to California from the eastern states were Boston fur traders taking the Cape Horn route at the end of the 18th century. They didn’t stay for long, but gradually other traders and fur trappers began to arrive overland through Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, settling only in small numbers until the famous covered wagons began their heroic treks of the 1840s. The hardships the pioneers suffered in the Sierra Nevada mountains, Death Valley, and the Mojave Desert became the stuff of California legend, the most tragic being the fate of 87 pioneers who set out from Illinois in 1846. While attempting to cross the Sierra Nevada, George Donner’s wagon train became snowed in, and from November until February was stuck high in the mountains north of Lake Tahoe, at a point now known as the Donner Pass. Just 47 people survived, and then only by resorting to cannibalism.<n>Just simple farmers seeking a place in the sun to work a piece of land, the pioneers came at a time when territorial expansion was much in vogue — the French in the Pacific and Algeria, the British in Africa and the Far East. The United States was eager to get in on the act and so, during the war with Mexico over the annexation of Texas, California was suddenly regarded as a useful addition to the spoils. United States forces captured Los Angeles in 1847, and the Mexicans capitulated at Cahuenga. A treaty of American annexation of California was signed on 2 February 1848. Meanwhile, unknown to the American and Mexican signatories, gold had been found in the Sierra Nevada foothills only nine days earlier.<n>The Gold Rush<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-History.txt
The Great Depression hit California hard. Income from agriculture dropped by 50 percent between 1929 and 1932, and one-fifth of the state’s population was on public relief. California managed to weather the downturn better than the rest of the country, however, and became a magnet for dispossessed refugees from the Dustbowl of the Midwest. “Okies,” as they were known, packed their families and belongings into rickety cars and trucks to make the epic voyage west to find work in the farms and orchards of California. Their tale of hardship, pride, bitterness, and exploitation is graphically recorded in the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel The Grapes of Wrath, by California writer John Steinbeck.<n>Then came World War II, bringing with it an enormous boom for the state’s beleaguered economy, with the United States federal government spending $35 billion in California. Overnight, ships and planes became the state’s most important products. Manufacturers such as Douglas, Lockheed, and Northrop were all located in the Los Angeles area.<n>In the post-war period California continued to prosper. Agriculture grew up into agribusiness; the film industry expanded into the new field of television; the aircraft industry was boosted by the space program; and semiconductor technology paved the way for Silicon Valley.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-History.txt
This takes some of the wind out of the sails of John Cabot, the Venetian navigator who claimed Canada’s eastern seaboard for England’s Henry VII in 1497. Locals fight over whether it was Nova Scotia or Newfoundland he actually discovered. Cabot himself mistook it for the northeast coast of Asia. In fact, Breton, Basque, and Portuguese fishermen had been here long before him but kept to themselves the secret of the coastal waters’ teeming cod fisheries. Initially, the English were attracted to Canada only by the fish, preferring to concentrate their colonizing activities farther down the American coast.<n>The French came looking for gold and diamonds, spices, and a passage to Asia. In 1535 Jacques Cartier ventured up the St. Lawrence as far as Hochelaga Village, dominated by a hill he named Mont Réal (Mount Royal). Cartier was not exactly showered with honors when he returned with eleven barrels of worthless yellow iron pyrites and glittering quartz. For the next 70 years, Canada was all but ignored until the French turned to the more lucrative new fur trade.<n>The strange European comings and goings were observed by native peoples whose ancestors had preceded these “discoverers” by at least 12,000, some of them 55,000, years. Waves of Siberian hunters had crossed a land bridge over the Bering Strait in pursuit of mammoth and bison. They spread through Alaska, south along the Pacific coast to the region of British Columbia, and later east across the Yukon and Northwest Territories.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt
Meanwhile, the huge untapped fur resources of northern Québec and Ontario attracted the renewed attention of the British. In 1610, navigator Henry Hudson thought he had located the fabled Northwest Passage for his London backers when, rounding the northern tip of Québec and heading south, he hoped, to China, he found himself locked in a vast bay on which he left his life and name. Over 50 years later, the bay was explored by two enterprising Frenchmen, Pierre Esprit Radisson and Médard Chouart des Groseilliers (known to Anglo-Canadian schoolchildren as “Radishes and Gooseberries”). Exasperated by the cost of the haul to Québec and by the heavy taxes imposed on fur pelts, they sought a new outlet for the fur trade. Fearing a commercial threat to the St. Lawrence River, the governor in Québec opposed their survey of the region.<n>This decision proved to be the beginning of the end for New France, for Radisson and Groseilliers promptly sold their idea to British merchants, who in 1670 founded the Hudson’s Bay Company. Charles II granted this tentacular private joint-stock company control of all territories draining into Hudson Bay; they were named Rupert’s Land after the king’s cousin, who was also titular head of the company. Its initials H.B.C. came to mean “Here before Christ.” It was here to stay.<n>The first British fur traders were much less adventurous than the French, waiting for the Indians to bring their pelts to the trading post rather than seeking them out in the forest. The coureurs de bois were more adapted to the wilderness and understood the Indians better. From them they learned to make swift, light birchbark canoes, snowshoes, and pemmican — a ghastly but nourishing mixture of buffalo fat with bits of dried meat and berries. The French also offered higher-quality goods. The H.B.C. was a penny-pincher, and Indians soon spotted — and spat out — its raw London gin tinctured with iodine to imitate French brandy.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt
William Lyon Mackenzie King, who became leader of the Liberal Party after Laurier’s death, made Canada progressively more independent of Britain. At the Imperial Conference of 1926 he won the acknowledgement that Canada was autonomous in external affairs and thus not subject to a common, British-dominated policy for the whole Empire. This led to the 1931 Statute of Westminster, which effected the equality of Britain and the Dominions, thus consecrating Canada’s full autonomy in home and foreign affairs. The governor general in Ottawa became the symbolic representative of the Crown rather than of the British government. But the provinces insisted that the Constitution remain with London rather than let Ottawa infringe on their prerogatives.<n>At the same time, the country came more and more into the American economic and cultural orbit. The boom years of the 1920s saw the growth of a “branch-plant economy;” with American automobile, rubber, chemical, and clothing factories springing up around the Great Lakes at Hamilton, Oshawa, Windsor, and Montréal. The boom in American popular culture inundated Canada with radio, movies, and mass-market magazines. Québec, in particular, tried to resist the invasion, even going so far as to ban adolescents from cinemas. Apart from the Group of Seven, a spirited band of Ontario painters who were seeking a distinctive “national” style, most Canadian-born artists — actors, musicians, and writers — felt obliged to seek fame and fortune in New York, London, or Paris.<n>Canada’s Great Depression was felt first by farmers in the Prairie Provinces, unable to get rid of their surplus from the wheat glut of 1928. Even the drought in 1929 did not ease matters, and ten more years of bad harvests meant they would not recoup their losses. Other sectors of the economy — timber, fisheries, mining, and construction — ground to a halt as production outstripped demand. Spirits were raised by the escapist fare of the new Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, today’s C.B.C. — Hollywood extravaganzas, and home-grown media stunts, not the least of which was the hullabaloo surrounding the Dionne quintuplets, born in Ontario in 1934.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt
The densely forested, rolling mountain range that the Québécois call les Laurentides constitutes a favorite summer and winter playground for the people of Montréal. Swimming, sailing, canoeing, waterskiing, fishing, hiking, horseback-riding, golf — the list of summer pleasures is endless. In winter, the skating and skiing, downhill and cross-country, are the best in eastern Canada. And the landscape is a pure joy, with long, narrow glacial lakes fed by cold streams gurgling down the granite mountain slopes of yellow birch, beech, sugar maple, and fir.<n>The virgin forests were long a refuge for Algonquin Indians fleeing the Iroquois. The Québécois began to settle here in any great numbers only in the second half of the 19th century, when an enterprising curate, Antoine Labelle of St-Jérôme, promoted it as an alternative for peasants who were otherwise immigrating to New England. This southeastern edge of the great Canadian Shield proved poor farm country and difficult to exploit for logging, but it really came into its own in the 20th century with the development of tourism. In addition to local Montréalers, it attracts steady traffic from New England.<n>The heart of the resort area is within an easy 90-minute to 2-hour drive from the city for a weekend or longer stay. Motorway 15 northwest from Montréal, then Highway 117 take you into forested foothills immediately beyond the metropolis.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Canada’s smallest province, just 224 km (139 miles) long and only 64 km (40 miles) across at its widest point, has a gentle rural atmosphere of rolling green meadows in the interior, with a coast of long sandy beaches at the foot of terra-cotta cliffs. The island nestles snugly in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, separated from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia by the Northumberland Strait. More than three-quarters of the area is given over to farmland. Rich in iron oxides, the red soil is best for potatoes, but farmers also grow succulent blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries. If the island’s lobsters are a worthy rival to Nova Scotia’s, its finest seafood is the oysters of Malpeque Bay.<n>Jacques Cartier named the island Ile St-Jean when he spotted it in the 16th century, but the French didn’t colonize it until after their retrenchment following the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. Like Nova Scotia, the island was transformed by the Acadians’ deportation and their replacement by New Englanders, who named it after Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, in 1799. The New Englanders preferred to exploit their property as absentee landlords, leaving it mainly to Irish and Scottish immigrants to clear the forests for shipbuilding and agriculture. P.E.I.’s great historic moment came in 1864, when its capital, Charlottetown, hosted a meeting of Maritime leaders with delegates from Ontario and Québec to chart the path to Canada’s federal status as a united dominion. The new Confederation Bridge connects Prince Edward Island (at Borden-Carleton) with Cape Tormentine in New Brunswick, raising fears that the island will lose its distinct character.<n>After potatoes (winning P.E.I. the name of “Spud Island,” a less grandiloquent alternative to “Cradle of Confederation”), tourism rates as the number two industry. The superb sandy beaches of the north coast attract over half a million visitors a year. Fans of Lucy Maud Montgomery’s novel Anne of Green Gables can visit here the landscape in which it was set.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The First Inhabitants<n>Long before the first European sailors beached in the Canaries, all seven islands were inhabited. The original Canarians came to be called Guanches, meaning in the native tongue “man.” Strictly speaking, this name applies only to the original inhabitants of Tenerife.<n>The Guanches are thought to have arrived in the islands around the 1st or 2nd century b.c., probably from North Africa. Ethnographers link them with the Cro-Magnon and Proto-Mediterranean race. They were tall, light-skinned, often blue-eyed and blond-haired. You can see their remains in the meticulous collection of the Museo Canario in Las Palmas on Gran Canaria. Here too you can study their preoccupation with death. Like the ancient Egyptians they carefully embalmed their dead, presumably for a ceremonial passage to the next world. Cryptic rock carvings have been found that may explain these rituals, but so far no one has found the Canarian version of the Rosetta Stone with which to decipher them.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-History.txt
The World Is Round!<n>Just as the conquest of the Canaries was reaching its climax, Christopher Columbus (Cristobal Colón in Spanish) was planning his historic expedition in search of a sea route to the East Indies. Each of the Canaries boasts some connection with Columbus, who came to the islands because they were then the world’s most westerly charted points and therefore the last stopping point before venturing into the unknown.<n>The great navigator definitely stopped off at Gomera and Las Palmas on his voyage of 1492, and he even recorded a volcanic eruption while passing Tenerife. Not surprisingly his crew took this as an ill omen, but as history tells us, once past El Hierro they did not drop off the edge of the world after all. Columbus’s routes and Canarian connections may be traced at the atmospheric Casa de Colón in Las Palmas (see page 55).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-History.txt
Spectator Sports<n>Canaries wrestling (lucha canaria): Rather like sumo wrestling, lucha canaria is a mixture of civilized ritual and caveman huffing and puffing. The basic aim is to throw the other man to the ground. The roots of the sport are hard to trace. Some say it came from Egypt, others that the Guanches may have devised it.<n>Fiestas and folklore exhibitions are still the tourist’s best chance of seeing la lucha.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhatToDo.txt
The East and South Coast<n>Candelaria is a town with deep religious roots. Legend has it that well before Christianity came to the Canaries an image of the Virgin was washed ashore here and worshipped by the Guanches, who were quite oblivious to its Christian significance. The Spaniards later built a church dedicated to the statue. Sadly, both the statue and the church were destroyed in 1826 when a tidal wave reclaimed the Virgin. The present over-sized basilica was built soon afterwards. The splendid new statue of Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, the patron saint of the Canary Islands, is the object of a major pilgrimage in mid-August. The Guanches are not forgotten either: ten chieftains stand guard in a row, with their backs to the Atlantic. These idealized cavemen are truly noble savages.<n>Just south and inland from Candelaria is Güímar, which with the exception of one curiosity is easily overlooked. However, those with an interest in the history of these islands will be intrigued by the Pirámides de Güímar <www.fredolsen.es/piramides>. The step pyramids (also known as the Chacona pyramids) here didn’t become evident until the early 1990s. They came to the notice of the Norwegian anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl, internationally acclaimed for his transoceanic crossings with prehistoric vessels and theories about human migration. After studying photos he came to the conclusion that the Chacona pyramids were similar in principal to those in the Old and New worlds. Subsequently, he took a personal interest and began to relate their existence to pre-Hispanic civilizations that either lived, or visited, the island. Today, on view, are not only the pyramids themselves, but models of Heyerdahl’s vessels, a video detailing his summaries and transoceanic crossings, and various other interesting audio-visual displays.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt

However, those with an interest in the history of these islands will be intrigued by the Pirámides de Güímar <www.fredolsen.es/piramides>. The step pyramids (also known as the Chacona pyramids) here didn’t become evident until the early 1990s. They came to the notice of the Norwegian anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl, internationally acclaimed for his transoceanic crossings with prehistoric vessels and theories about human migration. After studying photos he came to the conclusion that the Chacona pyramids were similar in principal to those in the Old and New worlds. Subsequently, he took a personal interest and began to relate their existence to pre-Hispanic civilizations that either lived, or visited, the island. Today, on view, are not only the pyramids themselves, but models of Heyerdahl’s vessels, a video detailing his summaries and transoceanic crossings, and various other interesting audio-visual displays.<n>There is little else of interest after here until you reach the south of the island. The most popular tourist destinations in Tenerife are the adjacent resorts of Los Cristianos and Playa de las Américas. Los Cristianos used to be a small fishing port with a quiet little beach. It now plays host to hundreds of thousands of mainly British and fewer German vacationers each year and its small beach, inside the port, is woefully inadequate. Traces of the old town can still be found around the port, though it is difficult to locate anything but British or German bars and restaurants along the crowded beachfront.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
A Brief History<n>During the last fifty years, a great deal of research has been undertaken to discover more about the great ancient societies of the Yucatán. Huge sections of their daily lives (and particularly why they came to abandon their cities) are still shrouded in mystery, but great strides have been made in deciphering their hieroglyphs and stelae (inscribed stone pillars). Despite these mysteries, there are few places in the world where the past feels as close as it does in the Yucatán. The thatched huts that appear in 1,000-year-old carvings at Uxmal can be seen today in every roadside village. The stone metates, or grinding dishes, which grace many a kitchen in town or village, are identical to those left as offerings to the rain gods in centuries past. Away from the cities, the people still speak the Mayan tongue, and their religious beliefs still bear the imprint of the ancient rituals of their ancestors. And, perhaps most striking of all, the distinctive hooked nose and sloping forehead of the ancient Maya, whose stony profiles look down on the visitor from the carved walls of their ruined cities, are still reflected in the features of the local people.<n>The Maya<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt
These people’s ancestors arrived in Central America many thousands of years ago. Small bands of Asiatic hunters migrated across the Bering Strait land bridge before 12,000 b.c. and gradually spread southwards through the Americas. During the Archaic period (after 5,200 b.c.), these people settled in what is now modern Mexico. They developed a primitive agriculture, domesticating cattle and cultivating corn, beans, chili peppers, and squash (a pumpkin-like vegetable) in burned clearings in the jungle. Over time, a society developed that was so successful they could devote time to activities other than simple food cultivation. These people, known as the Olmec, are considered to be the first Mesoamerican culture, the one from which all others evolved. They developed a calendar based on a 52-year cycle. They also constructed pyramids for worship.<n>By 1500 b.c. the group that came to be known as the Maya settled in an area which stretched from the Pacific coast to the southern Yucatán, taking in modern-day Guatemala, Belize, the western parts of El Salvador and Honduras, and the Mexican state of Campeche. In the succeeding centuries they migrated into the northern Yucatán — what are now the modern Mexican states of Yucatán, Quintana Roo, and part of Tabasco.<n>Though their antecedents are still shadowy, they were much influenced by the Olmec. They developed and refined the Olmec calendar and counting system, and improved their building practices. The whole Yucatán peninsula witnessed the flowering of classic Mayan civilization and a society of great sophistication; with its magnificent pyramids, temples, and palaces decorated with wall paintings and carved low-reliefs, a written language of hieroglyphics, and complicated medical procedures to heal the injured or the sick. Mayan astronomers tracked the movements of the heavenly bodies, predicting eclipses and marking the times for the planting of the new corn. In fact, corn came to symbolize life for the Maya — in their myths of creation, mankind was formed from lumps of maize dough. Elaborate rituals grew up around the preparation of the milpas (cornfields) and the planting and harvesting of the crop whose success depended on the coming of the annual rains. These rituals were undertaken by a small number of initiates who controlled the knowledge of the Maya. Because the region has no surface rivers, rain was a precious resource and the Maya saw any stock of water, such as the limestone water holes or cenotes, as holy places. The rain god Chaac was a very important deity, whose image can be seen at every Mayan site.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt

To incur the wrath of the gods would result in drought, a loss of crops, and certain starvation. To keep the gods happy, the people offered sacrifices at their great pyramid temples. The ceremonies were overseen by a powerful caste of high priests. Grain and animals were used, but the gods came to demand more, and a cult of human sacrifice grew. The Maya went out on raiding parties, taking hostages from the surrounding lands to use in their bloody ceremonies.

For reasons still unknown — perhaps civil war, drought, or disease — the great cities were abandoned. By the time the Spaniards arrived in the early 16th century the jungle was reclaiming the pyramids; the richly painted murals of warriors, Mayan lords, animals, and gods were already crumbling and dissolving in the warm rain. The priest caste seemed to have vanished, along with their knowledge. The only people the Spanish found were farmers.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt
In 1821, Mexico declared its independence from Spain. Tension had been simmering for decades, fostered by Spain’s treatment of her New Spanish-born colonists, or criollos (deemed to be second-class citizens compared to those born in the homeland). Her trade laws decreed that everything produced in New Spain must first cross the Atlantic to Spain before being traded with a third country so that the proper taxes and tariffs could be collected. The geography of the northern Yucatán region separated it physically from the rest of New Spain, and fewer colonial landowners settled here than the area around the new capital (now Mexico City). Furthermore, this isolation led to the development of a strong independent streak for both colonists and indigenous peoples. The Yucatán declared its independence in 1821 but did not join the fledgling country of Mexico until 1823. In 1840, it changed its mind, and withdrew from the union. This was the catalyst for the oppressed Maya to take up arms against their colonial oppressors.<n>In 1847, a savage uprising known as the Caste War saw Mayan rebels massacre white settlers and take control of nearly two-thirds of the peninsula. By 1850 they had driven the Mexicans back to their strongholds in Mérida and Campeche. However, in an amazing turnaround, the Maya’s ancient beliefs became their undoing. Just when the Mexicans were on the point of surrender, the rains came early and the Indians, obedient to their gods, dropped their weapons and returned to their milpas to plant the sacred corn. The settlers called in reinforcements and wreaked a terrible revenge on the natives. One group of rebels, known as the Chan Santa Cruz, held out in the jungles of Quintana Roo around the city of Tulum, harrying the Mexicans and making the east coast of the Yucatán a dangerous area, off-limits until well into the 20th century.<n>The Henequen Boom<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt
South to Tulum along theMaya Riviera<n>When tourism first came to this area of the Yucatán peninsula, the coastline between Cancún and Tulum was a pristine natural landscape, broken only by a few villages. Rocky coastal inlets where sea-water mingles with the fresh water of several cenotes are separated by acres of virgin mangrove. Parts of the coastline have sandy beaches that seem as if no human has ever set foot on them.<n>Of course with the success of Cancún, developers have looked for other opportunities in the region, and this stretch of coastline is gradually being taken for tourist development. Luckily, not every development mimics the grand resorts of Cancún, and there is some variety here, in both style and atmosphere; there are a number of all-inclusive hotel complexes, yet there are also interesting towns and ports. Tulum, with its magnificent Mayan ruins, forms a natural southerly point to the strip of coastal development, which has been given the name “The Maya Riviera.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
Three hours of traveling will bring you to the small town of Pisté and the remains of one of the most famous Mayan sites. Chichén Itzá has fired the imagination of archaeologists and tourists alike. No matter how many other people happen to be there when you visit, you cannot help but be impressed by Chichén Itzá. It has been well excavated and the huge range of structures give a lasting impression of how life would have been lived by the Mayan elite.<n>The city was built late in the empire’s cycle, between the sixth and ninth centuries (the post-Classic period). Despite large amount of research, scientists are still not in agreement as to exactly how the city evolved, and what influences came to bear. What is certain is that Toltec influences, in the form of the god Kukulkán (Quetzalcoatl) and Chaac-Mool reliefs, can be found here, along with traditional Mayan symbols. Another mystery yet to be solved is why the Toltec abandoned the city in 1200.<n>Some time later, in the 13th century, the Itzá, a Mayan tribe led by a ruler named Itzámna, moved north out of what is now the Campeche province to the tip of Yucatán and settled in the city. They gave the city the name Chichén Itzá; this probably means “Mouth of the Well of the Itzás.” They founded a capital at Mayapan, near the site of the modern city of Mérida. In the 15th century, following a bloody civil war, the Itzás abandoned Chichén Itzá. It had already been reclaimed by the jungle when the Spanish set foot on the peninsula.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
The great Han Dynasty (206 b.c.–a.d. 220), which followed the Qin, consolidated the imperialistic order. Civil servants were selected by competitive exams, the centralized government standardized currency, and the “Silk Road” across central Asia opened up trade with the rest of the world. On the military front, the Han triumphed over marauding Huns and the Central Asian nomads, and Chinese sovereignty was extended almost to today’s frontiers. The development of a new crossbow — which was a longer-range and more accurate weapon than China’s foes could deploy — ensured Han supremacy.<n>A golden age began, and a university was established in the capital city, Chang’an (now Xi’an). Intellectuals, who had been harried by the Qin, were encouraged in their creative endeavors; with the invention of paper, the influence of their writings spread. Sculpture, ceramics, and silk manufacture flourished. And Buddhism, a new religion, came to China from India via Tibet; it was to have an enduring effect on Chinese life and art.<n>Like many dynasties before and after, the Han succession ended in a new struggle for power and anarchy. As a result, the nation was split into three competing kingdoms. The era of the Three Kingdoms lasted only about half a century, but it had as a legacy some thrilling tales of derring-do that later inspired various plays and a classic Ming Dynasty novel. And the first mention of tea-drinking in China occurs in the third century, a footnote of fascination for social historians.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-History.txt
Yet by the beginning of the tenth century, the Tang rulers had lost their grip on the country. Revenues from tax collection dwindled, ambitious palace eunuchs plotted, reform schemes failed, and rebellious forces threatened. The emperors distributed their largess to too many warlords, hoping to pacify them. By 907 the people could see, through all the turmoil and confusion, that the dynasty had lost the “mandate of heaven,” and so it was that the last of the Tang monarchs abdicated.<n>Chinese historians designate the next 50 years as the era of “The Five Dynasties and the Ten Kingdoms.” This transitional period was marred by political and military infighting, and by rivalry, intrigue, and cruelty. Then, an able general named Zhaokuangyin (Chao K’uang-yin) came onto the scene and founded the Song (Sung) Dynasty (960–1280), which ensured Chinese cultural supremacy for the next three centuries.<n>The number of cities in China increased dramatically under the Song, mostly in the Yangzi valley and in the southeast. Where there were cities, there were scholars, artists, and artisans. Movable type revolutionized printing, books became more common, and literacy increased; Chinese scientists published works on botany, astronomy, mathematics, and geography. Emperors appointed court painters, and glazed porcelain was received abroad with admiration and awe.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-History.txt
The capital of the new empire was built on the site of present-day Beijing and was called “Dadu” or, in Mongolian, “Cambaluc” — spelled Kanbalu by that most renowned of medieval travelers, Marco Polo. His account of the vast new capital throbs with admiration for the palaces and bazaars and the profusion of shade trees. He regards with wonder the Great Khan’s religious tolerance, all-encompassing generosity, and admirable taste in wives. He reports all manner of innovations, not least the invention of paper money. (Counterfeiting, he reports, had also been discovered.)<n>Marco Polo’s account of life in legendary Cathay was received with incredulity in Europe, where it was suggested that his imagination had run wild. What else could the citizens of Venice make of his report that the “noble and magnificent city of Kin-sai” (now Hangzhou) had 12,000 bridges, many so high that sailing ships could pass under them? In England, schoolboys came to call a whopping exaggeration a “Marco Polo.”<n>With the death of Kublai Khan (in 1294, at age 80), the Mongols started to lose their grip on China. The great emperor’s successors lacked his vision and vigor. Insurrection was in the air, met by oppression and resulting in ever more sustained resistance. Finally, a full-scale uprising led by a peasant general, Zhuyuanzhang (Chu Yüan-chang), routed the Yuan rulers. In 1368 Zhuyuanzhang assumed the throne of the Middle Kingdom, founding yet another dynasty of brilliant promise — the Ming.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-History.txt
Pigtails and Prosperity<n>The invading “barbarians,” the Manchu, adopted all the refinements of Chinese civilization, installing a regime so conservative that it began to hold back progress. But for all their Confucian outlook and traditionalism, the Manchu imposed one singular feature of their own culture: the wearing of pigtails. Ironically, this was one peculiarity the rest of the world came to consider typically Chinese.<n>One of the most dynamic emperors was Kangxi (K’ang-hsi), who reigned at almost the same time as Louis XIV of France. He presided over a period of prosperity and positive achievement, rebuilding Beijing, encouraging scholarship, and expanding the empire to its greatest area. By the standards of his predecessors, Kangxi lived modestly enough; his concubines numbered no more than 300.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-History.txt
The soaring demand in Europe for Chinese tea, silk, and porcelain brought increasing pressure for freer trade. However, the Chinese were stubborn. Needing no commodities, they would accept only silver bullion in exchange for goods, thus undermining Britain’s balance of payments. Then, at about the turn of the 19th century, wily foreign traders thought of an alternative medium of payment — opium. Tons of the drug were brought into China.<n>In 1839 the Chinese government finally cracked down on this drain on the treasury, which was also causing mass addiction among the Chinese. Some 20,000 chests of opium were confiscated from British merchants in Guangzhou (Canton). Retaliation came a year later in the first of the Opium Wars, which culminated in a series of “unequal treaties” forced on an increasingly weak Manchu regime. China was obliged to open major ports to foreign political and economic penetration; Hong Kong was ceded to Britain.<n>Infinitely more costly in human terms was the Taiping Rebellion, which began in 1850 as a peasant revolt. There was a struggle between the Qing Dynasty and rebels determined to overthrow such traditional values as respect for religion, private property, and male supremacy. The revolt lasted 14 years and cost more lives than would World War I. The Beijing government finally won, but the regime and the nation would never be the same.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-History.txt
This became patently clear during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, in which the inadequacy of the Chinese army was starkly displayed. Japan and Western powers were dismantling the Chinese Empire. Demands for reform won the support of the emperor, but his notoriously scheming aunt, the Empress Dowager Cixi (Tz’u Hsi), edged him off the throne. Soon after, Cixi had the chance to exploit the Boxer Rebellion (1900), a revolt against foreign influence. It was finally put down by the intervention of all the great powers, which joined together in an unprecedented alliance. China was saddled with payment of a humiliating indemnity and a further loss of respect.<n>The elderly empress died in 1908, one day after the mysterious death of her nephew, the unseated emperor. The heir apparent was a two-year-old prince, Puyi — hardly the leader the dynasty and the nation needed in the face of civil disorder and foreign threats. Less than three years later, an army uprising took place in Wuhan and quickly won widespread support. The success of the revolution surprised many observers. It came so suddenly that Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the inveterate revolutionary who had led several earlier insurrections, was still abroad at the time. He returned in triumph to accept the presidency of the Chinese Republic. With a stroke of the brush, the Manchu Dynasty and its child-emperor surrendered in 1911. The imperial tradition, going back thousands of years, was snapped like a twig.<n>Unity Eludes the Chinese<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-History.txt
Mao Zedong’s “Great Leap Forward” (1959) was designed to mobilize the masses in a crash program of economic growth, but it kept the country in turmoil and brought unconvincing results. At about the time the Leap was suddenly reversed, relations between China and the Soviet Union plunged from polite to frosty to hostile. China cut off relations with the world and tested its own nuclear bomb.<n>From 1966 to 1976, China was convulsed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Millions of young Red Guards went on the rampage, and the whole country set about memorizing the maxims in Mao’s Little Red Book. Thousands perished and much of China’s cultural heritage was destroyed as a vestige of feudalism. Changes came in quick succession in the 1970s. The US president, Richard Nixon, visited China in 1972, thus normalizing relations between the two countries. In early 1976 the widely admired prime minister, Zhou Enlai, died. Eight months later, in September, death came to Chairman Mao himself.<n>Mao’s widow, the one-time film actress Jiangqing, and her close associates (the so-called Gang of Four) were arrested, tried, and imprisoned for encouraging the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. Thousands who had suffered during the fervid 1960s and 1970s, including the forceful pragmatist Deng Xiaoping, were rehabilitated. At the same time as Mao Zedong’s portraits and slogans were being removed from billboards and schoolrooms, a new flexibility was coming to the fore. Top priority was now assigned to the modernization of China’s underdeveloped economy. This opened the way for major scientific and commercial exchanges with the West. And foreign tourists soon began flooding into the country to see the splendors that had been inaccessible for so long.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-History.txt
Guangzhou in History<n>In the third century b.c. the founder of the Qin Dynasty annexed the remote Guangzhou area, thus furnishing China with its first major seaport. By the end of the Han Dynasty, foreign trade linked the port with other areas of Asia as well as with the Roman Empire. The name Guangzhou was bestowed during the Kingdom of Wu (third century a.d.), but foreigners came to call it “Canton.”<n>As commerce expanded, so did the foreign population of the port. By the ninth century, a large colony of Arabs, Jews, Persians, and others had settled here. They traded in tea, silk, and porcelain, all in constant demand abroad. It was to be another seven centuries before Europeans established themselves in Canton. The Portuguese were first, followed by Spaniards, Dutch, and English. The Chinese authorities tried to keep the foreigners at arm’s length, limiting their activities to certain districts and seasons.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Guangzhou’s prime Buddhist monument, the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees (Liurongsi), was founded over 1,400 years ago. The trees that inspired the 11th-century poet and calligrapher Su Dongpo to name the temple have died, but the often-restored complex remains a focus of local Buddhist activities. Overlooking it all is the Flower Pagoda (Huata), a slender relic of the Song Dynasty. From the outside, the pagoda appears to be nine tiers high, but there are really 17 floors inside. Adjacent is an unusual “death hall,” where the departed (their pictures posted on the walls) are remembered in daily prayers — for a fee, of course.<n>In the early medieval period, Guangzhou had a significant Muslim population as a result of trade with the Near East. This is how it came to pass that the city has what is said to be the oldest mosque in China, the Huaisheng Mosque (built in 627). Its white minaret can be climbed via a spiral staircase for a view of the courtyards, gardens, and Guangzhou’s modern skyscrapers.<n>The city’s leading tribute to the days of imperial splendor is the Chen Family Temple (Chenjiaci), a memorial to members of a large merchant clan from all over China. This sprawling compound of courtyards and showy 19th-century pavilions is decorated in a pantheon of finely carved friezes, gates, and gold-leaf tableaux depicting scenes of Chinese myth and romance.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Soon a modern, German-style city was built, with villas, a deepwater port, a cathedral, and a main street called Kaiser Wilhelmstrasse. Business was not everything: the Germans used Qingdao as a missionary base, too. It remains one of China’s more Christian cities. The twin-spired Catholic cathedral (Tianzhu Jiaotong) and the Protestant church (Jidu Jiaotong), with its working clock tower, tend to be crowded with local people on Sundays and have become tourist attractions.<n>German Qingdao suffered a curious fate during World War I. Japan, which joined the Allied forces, invaded the city, imprisoned the survivors of the German garrison, and occupied Qingdao for the duration of the war. China wasn’t able to regain sovereignty until 1922. After the Communists came to power in 1949, industrial development went forward. However, even though the population now exceeds 4 million (including the outlying regions), Qingdao keeps its quiet allure.<n>As permanent as any of the German contributions to Qingdao is its brewing prowess. The local beer has become China’s national beer, exported worldwide in big green bottles or modern cans under the old spelling of the town’s name, “Tsingtao.” Brewery tours can be arranged, and the Qingdao International Beer Festival in mid-August has become China’s first attempt at an “Oktoberfest.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
When the Big Wild Goose Pagoda (Dayanta) was built in a.d. 652 during the Tang Dynasty, it stood well within the walled city. But Xi’an has since shrunk in size, and now the seven-tiered brick pagoda rises in the middle of farming country to the south of the urban area. Grass grows from the pagoda’s roofs. The Big Wild Goose Pagoda was built to house precious Buddhist texts brought back from India by Xi’an’s most celebrated pilgrim, an intrepid scholar named Xuanzang. Having survived years of sandstorms and blizzards, demons and dragons, Xuanzang was feted on his return to the capital in 645. He spent the next two decades translating his stack of holy books from Sanskrit to Chinese.<n>Though it’s shorter, slimmer, and slightly newer than the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, the Small Wild Goose Pagoda (Xiaoyanta), built in a.d. 707, has more tiers: 13 at the moment. When it was built, it had 15 tiers, but the top came tumbling down in a Ming-era earthquake. Both these exquisite Tang Dynasty towers (the finest of their kind in China) can be climbed, yielding interesting views of the walled city and beyond.<n>Excursions from Xi’an<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Excursions from Xi’an<n>The oldest of the region’s archaeological wonders are found in a museum erected on the very site where they were discovered. This is at the Stone Age site of Banpo, 10 km (6 miles) east of Xi’an. Six thousand years ago a village, evidently thriving, occupied this farmland, but traces of habitation came to light only in the 1950s, when workmen were digging the foundations for a new factory.<n>You have to climb a flight of stairs to reach the covered excavation. From a series of walkways you look down on the outlines of houses, ovens, storage areas, and graves. You can follow the evolution of dwellings in China from round structures to rectangular houses with slanting roofs, the prototypes for today’s typical Chinese abode. Also on display in the Banpo Museum (Banpo Bowuguan) are some of the objects found in the course of excavations: axes, fishhooks, and utilitarian pots, as well as artistically decorated ceramics and, most dramatically, the skeletons of these ancient villagers.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
A Brief History<n>Nothing has had a greater impact on the Costa Blanca than foreign invasion: Iberians, Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Visigoths, and Moors had moulded Spain’s Mediterranean shores centuries before international tourism gained a foothold. But before any of these were the Costa Blanca’s first inhabitants: Known as Neanderthal men, they lived primitively and spent a large part of their time hunting. Then, as the Stone Age came to an end, short, dark-skinned Iberians started to make their way from North Africa to the Spanish Peninsula. These fierce fighters skilled in guerrilla warfare roamed the Mediterranean foothills, painting a vivid record of their battles on the walls of their rock shelters.<n>The Celts began to flood into Spain from the north sometime after 900 b.c. They settled in the north and west of the country, never penetrating as far as the Costa Blanca. In central Spain they were slowly absorbed by the reluctant Iberians, but elsewhere both tribes kept fiercely apart, establishing from the first the renowned independence that still characterizes Spain’s provinces.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-History.txt
After about 650 b.c., Greek traders arrived on the coast to compete for Spain’s rich mineral deposits and fertile land. The influence of Greece was short-lived, although the olive and the grape, Greek legacies, are cultivated in the region.<n>The Carthaginians, a people related to the Phoenicians, came from North Africa and subsequently took over much of southern Spain, beginning with Cádiz in 501 b.c. The town had sought help from the Carthaginian army in its war against local tribes, and the “invited guest” decided to stay. The main centre of Carthaginian power in Spain was located on the Costa Blanca: Carthago Nova, now Cartagena, followed in prominence by Alicante.<n>Carthage, challenged by Rome in the First Punic War (264–241 b.c.), lost most of her neglected holdings in Spain through Iberian attacks. But Carthage’s luck changed with an initial victory in the Second Punic War (218–201 b.c.). Hannibal, the Carthaginian general, led one of history’s greatest military marches the length of the Costa Blanca to France and Italy, crossing the Pyrenees and the Alps, in the hope of surprising an unsuspecting Rome. The Romans riposted by invading Spain to cut off Hannibal’s supply route and staying there 600 years.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-History.txt
Tapas<n>A tapa is a mouthful of anything that tastes good and fits on a cocktail stick. The variety is enormous: smoked mountain ham, spicy sausages, cheese, olives (some as big as pigeon’s eggs), sardines, mushrooms, mussels, squid, octopus, meatballs, fried fish, plus sauces and exotic-looking specialities of the house. The name comes from the practice, sadly almost vanished, of providing a free bite with every drink. The tidbit was put on a small plate traditionally used to cover the glass and came to be called a tapa, which means lid.<n>Touring tapas bars is great fun, especially in a town’s old quarter. It can be expensive, certainly more than the cost of an orthodox meal, but do try to devote at least an evening to it. The code is simple: one helping is called a porción; a large serving is a ración; half as much, a media-ración.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
The ensuing fall of Córdoba was as remarkable as its rise. In 1009, the caliphate splintered into a number of small kingdoms called taifas, which were constantly at war. The Christians in the north, seeing the enemy weakened and divided, captured the taifa of Toledo. Under threat of attack, the other taifas sought help from the Almoravids, fanatical Berber warriors. The Berbers marched against the Christians in 1086, and went on to reduce Moorish Spain to a province of their own North African Empire.<n>For a time, therefore, the affairs of Muslim Spain were administered from the Almoravid headquarters in Granada, until they lost their grip on the peninsula, softened by their life of ease in Andalucía. The pattern repeated itself a century later when the Moors invoked the aid of the Almohads in 1151. These primitive tribesmen, who came from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, soon made themselves the masters of southern Spain. They constructed major fortifications, such as Sevilla’s Alcázar, endowing the Moors with sufficient strength to resist the Christian forces a while longer.<n>The fortunes of the Moors and Christians swayed back and forth until 1212, when the Christians gained their first decisive victory at Las Navas de Tolosa in northern Andalucía. The Christians gradually captured and annexed the former bastions of Moorish rule; in 1236, Córdoba fell to James the Conqueror, followed by Sevilla in 1248. The Moors were in retreat, retrenching along the coast and withdrawing to the security of their strongholds in Ronda and Granada.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt
In military disarray and political decline, Moorish Spain nevertheless saw another two centuries of brilliance under the Nasrid dynasty, founded in Granada by Mohammed I in 1232. Refugees from Córdoba and Sevilla flooded into the city, bringing with them their many talents and skills and adding to the city’s brilliance. The magnificent palace of the Alhambra provided the setting for a luxurious court life dedicated to the pursuit of literature, music, and the arts.<n>Yet, the Moorish fortresses along the coast soon came under attack. Sancho IV took Gibraltar in 1310, but the Christians later relinquished their prize, and the Moors held on to it until 1462. In the 1480s, the Christians launched a new offensive; Ronda capitulated to the sovereigns Ferdinand and Isabella in 1485, followed by Málaga in 1487 and Almería in 1488. And all Christendom gave thanks when Granada was finally conquered in 1492.<n>The Golden Age<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt
Alfonso XIII, just 16 years old, assumed the crown in 1902. Prosperity and stability continued to elude the country, which remained neutral during World War I. Against a murky background of violence, strikes, and regional strife, the king accepted the dictatorship of General Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1923. Seven years later, the opposition of radical forces toppled Primo de Rivera from power. Alfonso XIII went into exile following anti-royalist election results in 1931, and another republic was founded.<n>Parliamentary elections in 1933 resulted in a swing to the right, and public opinion became polarized. When the left came out on top in the elections of 1936, the situation deteriorated at an alarming rate. It came as no surprise when, six months later, General Francisco Franco led a large section of the army against the socialist government. Support for the Franco-led nationalist uprising came from monarchists, conservatives, and the right-wing Falangist organization, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, while liberals, socialists, Communists, and anarchists sided with the government.<n>The bloodshed lasted no less than three years and cost hundreds of thousands of lives. General Franco emerged as the leader of a shattered Spain. Many Republicans went into exile; others simply disappeared. The Republican mayor of Mijas caused a sensation when he finally surfaced in the 1960s after three decades in hiding — in his own home. Franco kept Spain out of World War II, despite Hitler’s entreaties to the contrary. The Spanish nation gradually healed its wounds, though conditions in the country were difficult and life was far from easy.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-History.txt
Málaga’s international airport is the gateway to the Costa del Sol and Andalucía for most people. However, few visitors spend much time in the city itself. This is a shame, as Málaga is an ancient Andalucían city of not inconsiderable charm that offers a refreshing taste of the real Spain.<n>Founded by Phoenician traders more than 3,000 years ago, it came under Carthaginian and Roman rule before falling to the Moorish invasion force in 711. The Moors fortified the city, developing the settlement into a major trading port serving Granada, and it was one of the last cities in Spain to be re-conquered by Christian forces in 1487.<n>A good place to begin a tour is at Málaga’s principle landmark, Gibralfaro (from the Arabic Jebel al Faro — Lighthouse Hill). Located some 130 m (425 ft) above the city, this hilltop is capped by the ramparts of a Phoenician castle reconstructed in the 14th century by the Moors (who went on to build the lighthouse that gave Gibralfaro its name). The restored walls and parapets offer a superb panoramic view of both the city below and the coastline disappearing into the horizon. Because it looks down on the Plaza de Toros, the hill also acts as free seating for bullfights taking place below. Although it is possible to walk here, it is not recommended. Not only is the pathway somewhat difficult in places, it is also a well-known hangout for muggers. Best, then, to take a taxi.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Cádiz<n>The ancient city of Cádiz, sitting at the end of a very narrow peninsula of land that runs parallel to the coast, was founded by the Phoenicians in 1100 b.c. and is considered to be Spain’s oldest town. In fact, Cádiz’s amazing amalgam of history is not readily apparent, with only the remains of the old Roman Theater to give much evidence of the city’s age. It was re-conquered by Alfonso X in 1262 and granted the Monopoly of Trade with Africa by the Catholic Monarchs in 1493. Columbus also departed from this city on his second and fourth voyages in 1493 and 1502, respectively. In the latter part of the 16th century, it twice came under attack by enemy naval forces, and a period of prosperity ensued when the Casa de Contratación, or the monopoly rights for trade with the Americas, was transferred from Sevilla by order of Felipe V in 1717. A century later on 19 March 1812, while under attack from Napoleon’s forces, the national parliament met in the St. Felipe Neri Church and proclaimed the first Spanish parliament.<n>Of most interest in the town today is the architecturally contrasting Baroque and Classical cathedral, which was constructed between 1772 and 1838. The elegant Hospital de Mujeres (Women’s Hospital), built even earlier in 1749, is notable for its patio and art collection, including a fine El Greco. The curious and unusual Oratorio de la Santa Cueva (Church of Santa Cueva) has original underground chapels dating from 1783. Of more interest is the domed upper chapel added in 1796, whose ceiling is adorned by five spectacular paintings — three of which are fine examples of Goya’s work. The St. Felipe Neri Church, mentioned above, is also well worth a look. Built in 1679, it has towering columns and an unusual elliptical dome.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
The name of this town is indicative of two things. It once lay close to the frontier of the old Moorish kingdom of Granada, hence de la Frontera. And Jerez (pronounced khay-reth) gave its name to the wine that has made the town famous, better known to the world in its anglicized version — sherry.<n>Although known as long ago as the Phoenician era, Jerez first came to prominence under the Moors in the 11th and 12th centuries, and it is from that period that the impressively walled and towered Alcázar dates. Inside is a simple but elegant mosque that was later converted into a chapel dedicated to Santa María la Real. Re-conquered by King Alfonso X in 1264, it became one of the most prosperous towns in Andalucía after the discovery of the Americas and the reunification of Spain in 1492.<n>Below the Alcázar lies the Colegiata (Collegiate Church), a towering dark stone cathedral dating from the 17th to 18th centuries. Housed within is the precious image of Cristo de la Viña (Christ of the Vineyard). It was the development of the sherry wine and brandy business that brought the city worldwide acclaim and more prosperity. It is impossible to walk the streets without recognizing bodegas (wineries) of prestigious old firms such as Harvey, Williams & Humbert, Gonzalez-Byass, and Pedro Domecq. As some of the names imply, it was a group of English merchants who launched Jerez as the world capital of fortified wine.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
On the north side of the cathedral lies the Patio de los Naranjos (Court of the Orange Trees), the ceremonial courtyard of the old mosque with its original ablutions fountains. The minaret, dating from 1184, was preserved as the bell tower of the cathedral; this celebrated Giralda tower is Sevilla’s most famous landmark. The exterior is beautifully decorated with typical sebka design work. It contrasts vividly with the bland interior, where a series of 35 gently elevating ramps lead to an observation platform at a height of 70 m (230 ft). Ferdinand III rode his horse to the top following the Reconquista in 1248.<n>This is the finest mirador in Sevilla, and provides for unparalleled views of the old city below. It is surprising to note just how large the Plaza de Toros is when seen at this angle. Look up and you will see how the tower came by its name. In 1356, an earthquake destroyed the original ornamental top. And it wasn’t until 1558 that the addition of the huge bells and a weather vane (Giralda in Spanish) in the form of a statue of a beautiful goddess representing Faith, raised the height to 98 m (322 ft).<n>The Alcázar (entrance on far side of the square, through the Puerta del León) is a major monument to mid-14th century Mudéjar architecture, combining Moorish, Gothic, and Renaissance elements. Built by Moorish craftsmen under Christian rule, during the reign of Pedro the Cruel, the rambling palace and its several courtyards incorporate fragments of an earlier Moorish fortress, and blend Christian motifs with Moorish designs. A visit begins with a tour of the Cuarto del Almirante (the Admiral’s Apartments), where a painting of the Virgen de los Mareantes (Virgin of the Mariners) in the chapel shows Columbus sheltered beneath the Virgin’s cloak. The most interesting part is the Patio de las Doncellas (Courtyard of the Maidens), where the rooms preserve outstanding decorative features — ornamental tiles, carved stucco, and characteristic coffered artesonado ceilings.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
C rete’s long history is bound with its strategic position at the crossroads between Western Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. In good times this brought trade, ideas, and prosperity; in bad times — invasion, oppression, and disease. Many fascinating legacies around the island attest to the complicated web that time has spun here. Each era has left its distinctive mark.<n>The earliest human remains found on Crete date back to the seventh millennium b.c. These first inhabitants were Neolithic cave dwellers who came from Asia Minor. They developed into farmers with settlements and pastureland on the fertile Messará Plain. It was an influx of new settlers with Bronze Age skills around 3000 b.c. that ushered in the Minoan era, the first major civilization to arise on European soil.<n>The Minoans<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-History.txt
The Minoans developed into one of the great naval powers of the Mediterranean, with the wood from the vast cypress forests providing material for boats. But they concentrated their power more for commercial than military gain, showing a taste for the good life rather than a hunger for an empire.<n>This great civilization came to a sudden, catastrophic end around 1450 b.c. The exact cause remains unknown, but all the palaces were destroyed at the same time. The charred remains at Knossós and ash at Zákros suggest a great conflagration. A leading theory for many years was that natural disaster struck the island in the wake of the volcanic explosion on the island of Thíra (Santorini), due north of Crete, bringing a maelstrom of tidal waves, earthquakes, and fire storms. The most recent research has uncovered evidence supporting another hypothesis — that an attack by invaders or rebel forces may have brought about the end of this fine culture. Scholars will continue to debate the reason for many years to come.<n>Dorians and Romans<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-History.txt
There were sporadic attempts at revolt, often launched from remote mountain strongholds where rebels could survive in safety. The more vulnerable communities on the lower plains paid a high price for these in the form of swift bloody reprisals. The first major rebellion occurred in 1770 when the Russians, hoping to distract the Turks while they waged their own attacks on the Ottoman Empire elsewhere, promised support to Dhaskaloyiánnis, a wealthy shipowner. He raised a revolt in Sfakiá, but the support never arrived. The rebellion was crushed, Dhaskaloyiánnis was flayed alive, and the event became the subject of a rousing epic poem. There were notable uprisings in 1828 when its leaders were killed at Frangokástello, and in 1866 when 2,000 people died in a suicide bombing at Arkádi Monastery. It is not surprising that at this time many town-dwelling Cretans kept a low profile. They publicly converted to Islam to escape heavy taxes, continuing to practice their Orthodox faith in secret.<n>However, once Greece had achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire after the War of 1821, the atmosphere changed. Though Crete had to endure nearly a century more of subjection to Turkish domination it stirred the blood of many native sons who vowed to rid the island of its oppressors. The ferocity of later Cretan resistance against the Turks had all the trademarks of their fiercely independent spirit. Violent insurrections provoked equally violent massacres in retaliation; and death came to form a monumental collective badge of honor.<n>The island’s repeated suffering was duly celebrated in the popular heroic Songs of Dighenis (adapted from their medieval origins for the modern struggle), Pandelis Prevelakis’ grim novel, The Cretan, and the lofty writings of Níkos Kazantzákis.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-History.txt
Rooms 14–16 on the second floor display the finest remaining frescoes found throughout the Minoan kingdoms dating from 1600–1400. There are twenty-one in room 14, and nine in room 15, depicting the enigmatic Minoans at work and play, and their major influences — the bull, other animals, and the marine environment. At the center of gallery 14 is the only stone sarcophagus found on the island. Spiral decoration frames scenes of libation and other religious activities. At the far end of the hall you will be able to examine a miniature recreation of the palace of Knossós, completed according to early hypotheses on its design.<n>Room 17 houses a once private collection — that of Irackliot doctor Stylianós Giamalákis — which came to the state in 1962. He obtained objects from every era of Crete’s history from Neolithic figurines to jewelry from the Venetian and Turkish eras. In addition there are objects of ancient Babylonian and Persian origin.<n>Rooms 18–20 move on through the Archaic period to the Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman eras with colossal marble statuary gracing the gallery space here.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
The first palace at Knossós was built around 2000 b.c. in the Old Palace era, but this was destroyed by a massive earthquake only 300 years later. Most of the remains seen at the site today constitute the second palace built following the disaster which also coincided with a Golden Age of Minoan society or the New Palace era — 1700 b.c., when the people were rich through trade, and artistic endeavor was at its peak. The palace grew continuously through the following years resulting in a complex of around 1200 small rooms several stories high covering over 20,000 sq m (215,278 sq ft). The construction was immensely complicated with light wells illuminating lower chambers and polythyra, masonry supports to create structural integrity, between which were large wooden doors serving as partitions.<n>The golden era came to an end in 1450 b.c. and major fire caused catastrophic damage around 1350 b.c., but though the palace was completely destroyed the site continued to be occupied until the 5th century a.d.<n>The palace was erected around a large Central Court, used for public meetings, which now forms the heart of the site. Imagine Minoans at play here as depicted on the pottery and frescoes in the Archaeological Museum in Iráklion — acrobats and dancers as well as the famed bull leapers. Visitors enter past what remains of the West Court used as an entryway to a West Wing, where the administrative and religious activities took place. Minoans would walk down the corridor of processions past frescoed walls to reach the propylaia (sacred entranceway). A Grand Staircase then led north to the most important official chambers within this wing, its sturdy painted colonnades typical of those found throughout the palace. The lower floor here houses the throne room with ornate griffin frescoes and a lustral basin for ritual purification. The gypsum throne is the oldest in Europe and traces of paint show that it would have been brightly colored when in use. The walls — lined with stone seats thought to have been used by advisers or councilors — would have been decorated with red plaster and an ornamental dado. In the northeastern corner was a crypt where a cache of treasures was unearthed during the excavations.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
The Phaistós disc was discovered here in 1903 but not in any of the important Palatial-era rooms. It was discovered by workmen on the northern edge of the site in a tiny clay walled chamber. The disc, said to date from 1700 b.c., is covered with a spiral pattern of symbols and geometric forms that have yet to be deciphered. You can see the original in the Archaeological Museum in Iráklion; or buy a copy at any souvenir store.<n>Just 3 km (2 miles) from Phaistós is Agía Triáda, built, archaeologists believe, as a summer palace for the royal court and linked to the city by Minoan road. Set on a hillside overlooking the Gulf of Messará it offered excellent views and cooling sea breezes as the sea came much closer in those days. The remains indicate a series of blocks of rooms that could work as a whole or could operate individually if needed. Perhaps this was to accommodate different sizes of entourage at different times. The west wing of the palace housed the royal quarters. Agía Triáda was built late in the Minoan era, around 1700 b.c. and though it suffered great damage in the cataclysm of 1450 b.c., it was reoccupied, and a Dorian town was built nearby. Since this was famed in its time for several shrines, scholars have debated that the original palace may have had some religious purpose. Numerous tombs have been excavated on the hillside, and the sarcophagi in the Iráklion museum, finely decorated with cult scenes, was found here. Atop the whole site is the incongruous Ágios Geórgios, a pretty whitewashed 14th-century church.<n>If by now you are in need of some rest and refreshment make your way to the coastal resort of Mátala just a little way south of Phaistós. Here you’ll find a good sandy bay lined with tavernas, and you can enjoy a re-energizing lunch or cool dip. The waters are well-regarded by snorkelers and there are fascinating remains of a Roman port under only a few feet of water. On the northern side are high sandstone cliffs where you will find many large Roman tombs cut into the rock. Until recently they were unprotected and used as free camping spots by travelers. Today they are fenced and guarded, though for a small fee you can still explore these fascinating man-made caves.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Ágios Nikólaos does not have great beaches; as a consequence much of its up-market accommodations are outside the town. Head north and you’ll find some of the best accommodations in Europe with a cluster of luxury hotels at Eloúnda. The village itself is understated, with a pretty church on the waterfront. You can also head to Spinalónga from here — a much shorter trip than from Ágios Nikólaos because the island lies just offshore. Its lower section is linked to the mainland by a narrow bridge. Or you can head even further north on the main island to the tiny coastal resort of Pláka and take a rowboat ferry to Spinalónga. You’ll find a number of excellent seafood tavernas here for an alfresco lunch after your visit.<n>Spinalónga Island has been settled since ancient times. In the shallows off its southern tip are the remains of the Greco-Roman city of Ólous and just beyond the bridge a 4th-century a.d. mosaic within the foundations of an early Christian basilica. But it is the north of the island that attracts most visitors. Here, on a small rocky sub-islet are the remains of the Venetian stronghold of Spinalónga, built in 1579 to protect the entrance to this sheltered bay. Its strong bastions and high ‘curtains’ were never taken by an enemy. The Venetian garrison remained here until 1715, over 60 years after the fall of Iráklion, and only left after a treaty gave them safe passage. The Turks in turn retreated to the island when they came under threat from Cretan rebels at the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Cretan council decided to open a leper colony on the island; whether this was an attempt to force the Turks to leave is open to debate but the disease was rampant on the main island and Spinalónga’s position — offshore yet not too remote — was considered ideal for study of the disease and a quarantine for its sufferers. Initially, the regime was harsh, with fear and ignorance causing victims to be treated more like criminals than patients; however, conditions improved over the years until the colony was disbanded in 1957. Wandering among the remains lends poignancy to your exploration. This history was made within the lifetime of many visitors.<n>Inland from Ágios Nikólaos are three attractions that make an enjoyable morning or afternoon sightseeing. Head out towards the village of Kritsá 12 km (7 miles) from town. Before you reach the village itself you’ll find a beautiful Byzantine chapel on your right. Panagía Kerá was built in the 13th century and decorated with superb frescoes of the 14th and 15th centuries. You’ll need time to take in every detail of the interior and the simple lines of the exterior.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
The island of Santorini (also called Thirá) is one of the ‘must see’ places in the world. Arriving by sea brings the stunning vista slowly into view allowing the full magnitude of its structure to open out in front of you, for Santorini frames the largest volcanic crater in the world.<n>A massive eruption of its volcano around 1500 b.c. carried the whole interior of the island high into the atmosphere, changing the climate of the earth for years afterwards. In place of land came water, surging in to fill the 11-km (7-mile) long void and causing massive tidal waves around the Mediterranean Sea.<n>What remains today is the outer rim of the original circular island. Sheer cliffs up to 300 m (984 ft) high bound the caldera, and a number of whitewashed settlements nestle along their crests — looking from a distance like icing melting down the sides of a Christmas cake.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
From Guadalest, the road leads to the small town of Callosa de Ensarriá, centre of the honey industry, where you can taste before you buy, often six or eight different flavours. From Callosa take the Parcent road, follow it for 21⁄2 km (11⁄2 miles), and make a right-hand turn at the entrance to the El Algar waterfalls, a tumbling oasis beneath the massive Sierra Bernia formed by a tributary of the River Guadalest. Leave your car in the parking area and walk to the 27-metre (80-foot) falls. You can swim beneath them in chilly waters, then picnic by the cool, leafy pools above. It’s easy to get away from crowds in this pleasant spot, but if you’re in the mood for company, you’ll find lots of people in the restaurants near the car park.<n>The next stop is Tárbena (10 km/6 miles farther along the C-3318), an invigorating mountain village famed for its delicious sausages. They’re made from a secret recipe handed down to the present-day villagers by their Mallorcan ancestors, who came here in the early 17th century as part of an official repopulation scheme.<n>After Tárbena comes the finest scenery of all: bold, terraced mountains, wide undulating valleys, and scattered farms connected by mule tracks. In spring the countryside is covered with the pink and white of almond blossoms, but the road is for all seasons, with groves of gnarled olive trees alongside it, their leaves blowing silver in the evening light. Follow the road to Coll de Rates, 500 metres (1,500 feet) above the wide orange- and vine-filled plains that sweep up to Jávea, Denia, Gandía, and the deep-blue Mediterranean. Farther on, take the road to Jalon, where in late summer farmers sell muscat grapes to passers-by, and you can buy some of the strong local wine. Or carry on past Orba to Benidoleig and visit the prehistoric caves, Las Calaveras. Here high-domed ceilings drip with stalagtites, and human bones more than 50,000 years old have been found.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
The Hort del Cura (Priest’s Grove) is celebrated even in Elche for its cactus, pomegranate, and orange trees, and above all, for the palmera imperial. This male tree of exceptional age and size has seven branches growing from one main trunk. The palmera imperial and many other trees in the grove have been dedicated to royalty and celebrities like Carmen Polo de Franco, the widow of the Generalísimo.<n>Overlooking the grove’s lily pond is an exact replica of the famous bust of the Dama de Elche (The Lady of Elche). The original, dating from 500 b.c. and now housed in Madrid’s Archaeological Museum, remains something of a puzzle almost a hundred years after it came to light. If you cover that exotic headdress, you’ll see why attributions are difficult to make: The face could be male or female, Spanish, Greek, or Eastern.<n>To visit the place where the bust was discovered, go to the nearby hamlet of La Alcudia. Be sure to see the exhibits of Iberian and Roman finds displayed in the excellent local museum. On the way, you’ll see palms that look rather like giant asparagus tips. Encapuchadores bind these male trees in spring to produce the pale, bleached fronds that are used in Palm Sunday celebrations. These branches, once suitably blessed, are said to conduct lightning, and you’ll see them attached to houses all over Spain. The female palms make a less esoteric annual contribution of 10,000 tons of dates, which ripen in December and are prized for their juicy sweetness.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
Throughout the 19th century, the United States, keenly interested in the island’s strategic significance and its sugar market, had become increasingly involved in Cuban affairs. A US purchase of the island from Spain had long been on the agenda, even though Martí had warned of becoming a satellite of the United States (“I know the Monster, because I have lived in its lair,” he wrote).<n>In February 1898 the U.S.S. Maine was sunk in Havana’s harbor, killing all 260 crew members. Although Spanish responsibility was never incontrovertibly established, the United States used the sinking as a pretext to declare war. US victory came swiftly, with Spain surrendering claim to the island by the end of the same year. A provisional military government lasted to 1902, when Cuba became an independent republic.<n>False Independence<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-History.txt
Though just spitting distance away, these quintessentially Cuban towns are a world apart from Varadero. Their poorly stocked shops, dusty backstreets, and primitive transport provide Varadero’s package tourists with a convenient insight into everyday Cuban life before they’re whisked back to their hotels.<n>Matanzas, 42 km (26 miles) west of Varadero, is busy and grimy. Lying alongside a deep bay, it came into its own during the 19th century as the country’s sugar capital. On the leafy main square, Parque Libertad, the Museo Farmacéutico is a wonderfully preserved chemist’s shop, founded in 1882. On a street running east toward the bay, the Catedral de San Carlos is notable for its many murals, some restored, some badly in need of attention.<n>A little farther to the east, impressive buildings on Plaza de la Vigía include the Palacio de Junco, which houses a second-rate provincial museum, and the Teatro Sauto. Constructed in 1863, the lovely theater has tiers of wrought-iron boxes and a mural ceiling; there are performances most weekends.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
Around Trinidad<n>Trinidad’s prosperity in the 19th century came from the fruits of 50 sugar mills nearby in the scenic Valle de los Ingenios (Valley of the Sugar Mills), like Trinidad a UNESCO “World Heritage Site.” A mirador (lookout) with spectacular views is just 5 km (3 miles) out of town. Just 10 km (6 miles) farther east is the Manacas-Iznaga, where you can explore a lovely colonial hacienda house and its startling, rocket-shaped Torre de Manacas-Iznaga. From the top of the tower, the Iznaga family would keep watch over their slaves toiling in the fields. If you don’t have a car, you can hire a private taxi for about US$12 roundtrip. A special 18th-century steam train used in the sugar trade traverses the whole valley for tourists; if it is functioning, it is a must. The train leaves from Estación Dragones, 1 km (5⁄8 mile) from the city center, at 10am and returns at noon.<n>Beach worshippers should head to Playa Ancón, about 16 km (10 miles) from Trinidad, an excellent strip of white sand and clear waters. Here you’ll find diving at an offshore coral reef, a good choice of watersports, and two hotels popular with package tourists. Again, you can hire a taxi or pick up a bicycle rental (give it a test ride first, as many are so primitive that they would be scoffed at by any self-respecting commuter from Hanoi or Beijing). Another good beach and fishing excursion, offered by Rumbos Tours, is the daytrip to the tiny island of Cayo Blanco from Playa Ancón.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
The early history of Nepal is a mixture of fact and myth; religious lore is associated with virtually every landmark and event. Actually, so intertwined are legend and history that it is often impossible to determine where fact leaves off and legend begins. The prime example of this commingling of fact and fiction involves the origin of the Kathmandu Valley.<n>Legend holds that the Kathmandu Valley was once a vast lake, upon which floated a giant lotus flower, from which emanated the light of Swayambhu, the primordial Buddha. When the Tibetan god Manjushri came to view this light, he was unable to get close enough for a good look, so he took his great sword and slashed through the mountains surrounding the valley to release the waters of the lake. (That is the myth. The fact, according to geologists, is that the Kathmandu Valley was indeed once a lake, though the valley’s waters now drain through the narrow cleft of Chobar Gorge, which was most likely created by a large earthquake.)<n>One side effect of Manjushri’s draining of the lake was that the snake gods called Nagas, which lived in water, were left with no place to live. So, once again Manjushri interceded and created a pond for them to live in. This pond still exists today not far from Chobar Gorge. However, elsewhere around Kathmandu, there are other stagnant ponds from which rise statues of Nagas; these ponds, too, are dedicated to the snake gods.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-History.txt
The Licchavi dynasty, of high-caste Hindu origin, ruled in the Kathmandu Valley from about a.d. 330 to 700. King Manadeva I (a.d. 462–505) shook off the domination of the India Gupta emperors and extended his kingdom from the Kosi River in the east to the Gandaki River in the west and from the Terai to the Himalayan passes. A great king of this line, Amsuvarna (609–621), married his daughter Bhrikuti to the ruler of Tibet, Srongtsen Gampo. In 640, Bhrikuti and her Chinese co-wife converted Srongtsen Gampo to Buddhism. Bhrikuti is venerated as the “Green Tara” and the Chinese wife as the “White Tara.” Their images are prominent in Nepalese Buddhist art. Commercial and cultural links with Tibet, and through Tibet with China, were strengthened at this time.<n>More reliable records come with the next major dynasty, the Malla, who were established in about 1200 by the strongman Ari Malla. The Malla came to Nepal in the first of several waves of Hindu fugitives from the 11th-century Muslim invasion of northern India. Many of the refugees were nobles of the Chetri warrior caste from Rajasthan; forging new feudal states in Nepal, they were responsible for reinforcing Hinduism at the expense of Buddhism. The Kathmandu Valley itself was raided in 1336 by the Muslim Sultan of Bengal. In seven days he destroyed both Hindu and Buddhist temples and statues, including Swayambhunath and Pashupatinath. These great shrines were later rebuilt and expanded into their present magnificence.<n>The Malla period saw completion of Nepal’s most important palaces, temples, and works of art. But Nepal and the Mallas became fragmented upon the death in 1482 of King Yaksha Malla, who divided his lands amongst his heirs. For the next three centuries Nepal had three city-states side by side in the valley — Kantipur (now known as Kathmandu), Lalitpur (now known as Patan), and Bhaktapur (also sometimes called Bhadgaon), along with their hinterlands.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-History.txt
John Law’s promotional activities weren’t confined to the French. He signed up some 10,000 Germans, mostly Rhinelanders, to share the “golden future” in Louisiana. Today, west of New Orleans along what is called the German Coast, you can see towns with names like Hahnville, Kraemer, and Des Allemands. Most descendants of the German pioneers, however, Frenchified their names, thus Delmaire was originally Edelmeyer and Fauquel was Vogel.<n>Black slaves from Africa also arrived in the earliest years of the colony. In 1724, the Bienville enacted the Code Noir (Black Code), which regulated the conditions of slavery and the rights of free blacks. The code, more liberal than the laws elsewhere in the South, remained in force in Louisiana for a century. As for the Mississippi Bubble, it burst in 1720. France came out of the deal bankrupt and with huge pieces of land considered to be worthless. John Law died in 1729, dispossessed in Venice.<n>High Society<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_NewOrleans-History.txt
During the American Revolution, New Orleans plunged in on the revolutionist side. It wasn’t only enthusiasm for the Yankees; Spain declared war on England in 1779. The governor of New Orleans, 23-year-old Don Bernardo de Gálvez, seized the chance to help the colonists in their struggle against George III, and led raiding parties that kept the British outposts along the Mississippi on the defensive.<n>After the American Revolution came the French Revolution and a new world order. The ambitions of Napoléon Bonaparte stretched as far as the Western Hemisphere, and an influx of French aristocrats buoyed French sentiments. By the secret Treaty of Ildefonso in 1800, France regained Louisiana from Spain after 38 years.<n>But in 1803, only three years after retaking it, France sold Louisiana to the United States for $15 million. It was a controversial amount at the time — more than the US Treasury owned — but the Louisiana Purchase, as it became known, covered land from Canada to the Rockies to the Gulf of Mexico, and almost doubled the area of the United States. The deal turned out to be the bargain of all time — something like four cents an acre for what became Iowa, Arkansas, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and most of Kansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_NewOrleans-History.txt
By the 1830s, New Orleans had reached its heyday. The sound of post-war prosperity was the blast of steam whistles on the river. With the development of powerful steamboats, navigation on the Mississippi became a practical, economical matter. Freighters moved cotton, tobacco, and sugar downriver and worldwide. Passenger ships like the Natchez and the Belle of Memphis were palaces with food, drink, music, and romance, at a time when even short journeys could take many days.<n>Thousands of steamboats docked along the quays every year. By 1840 New Orleans was the world’s largest cotton port, second only to New York as a general port, and the fourth biggest city in the United States, with a population of 100,000. American families, who came south looking for a place to settle, found themselves unwelcome in the French Quarter. Instead they created a second city upriver — now the Garden District — using the plentiful land that once constituted sugar plantations.<n>It was also the era of benefactors both in social and cultural fields. One was John McDonogh, who elevated conditions for the ordinary people of the city. A plantation owner of Scottish extraction, he educated and freed many slaves. Most of City Park is land he willed to the children of New Orleans. When he died, a millionaire, in 1850 (back when a million dollars really meant something), he left his money to the city to build schools for the poor. Dozens are still named after McDonogh, who, in effect, founded the city’s public school system.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_NewOrleans-History.txt
These days, they find room for their papers in the Palais de Justice and the nearby Préfecture de Police, haunt of those fictional detectives, Inspectors Maigret and Clouseau. The great lobby of the Palais, the Salle des Pas Perdus, is worth a visit for a glimpse of the many lawyers, plaintiffs, witnesses, court reporters, and assorted hangers-on waiting nervously for the wheels of French justice to grind into action.<n>Their anxiety is nothing compared with that of the prisoners once held in the forbidding Conciergerie (entrance on the quai de l’Horloge). It was originally the residence of the king’s concierge as part of the 14th-century royal palace. In 1793, at the height of the Terror, it literally became the “antechamber of the guillotine.” Queen Marie-Antoinette, Robespierre, Danton, and Saint-Just all spent their last nights in the Galerie des Prisonniers. The Salle des Girondins displays a guillotine blade, the crucifix to which Marie-Antoinette prayed, and the lock used on Robespierre’s cell. Look out on the Cour des Femmes, where husbands, lovers, wives, and mistresses were allowed one final tryst before the tumbrels came to carry off the condemned. About 2,500 victims of the Revolutionary guillotine spent their last hours in the Conciergerie.<n>Notre-Dame<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
Beaubourg<n>East of the Forum des Halles, streets closed to traffic and lined with cafés, brasseries, art galleries, and boutiques link up with the startling Centre Georges-Pompidou. This avant-garde multimedia cultural center, which also houses the Musée National d’Art Moderne (see page 74), reopened 1 January 2000 after lengthy renovation. Controversy raged for years after the 1977 opening of this colorful “oil refinery.” The comparison came as no surprise to the architects, Italy’s Renzo Piano and Britain’s Richard Rogers, who deliberately left the building’s service systems visible — and color-coded. Now, as with the Tour Eiffel and the Louvre’s Pyramid, people have learned to live with it and even love it, and it averages 23,000 visitors every day.<n>Besides its permanent art collections and popular library open to all, ingenious exhibits cover every aspect of contemporary life, artistic and technological, and the aesthetics of consumer culture. There is a particular emphasis on young people. The place also offers a terrific view. Pay the museum admission, then take the escalators running in transparent tubes from the bottom left to the top right hand corner and see Paris unfold before your eyes. The sloping plaza outside is one of Paris’ most popular locations for street performers.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
Latin Quarter<n>As far back as the 13th century, when Paris’s first university moved from the cloisters of Notre-Dame to the Left Bank, the young came to the quartier to learn Latin. Here, the tradition of scholastic inquiry has often evolved into a spirit of protest and outright revolt before subsiding into a lifelong skepticism.<n>In ancient days the university simply meant a collection of scholars who met on a street corner or in a public square or courtyard to listen to a lecture given from a bench or balcony. Now the tradition of open-air discussion continues over coffee or a glass of wine on some café terrace on the boulevard St-Michel or in the streets around the faculty buildings.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
The Prime Minister’s splendid residence, Hôtel Matignon at 57 rue de Varenne, is a short walk from the National Assembly. Its private park has a music pavilion favored for secret strategy sessions. On the same elegant 18th-century street, the Musée Rodin at number 77 houses the sculptor’s works in the delightful Hôtel Biron (see page 75).<n>Most important sight in the neighborhood is the monumental Hôtel des Invalides, established by Louis XIV as the first national hospital and retirement home for soldiers wounded in action. At one time it housed approximately 6,000 veterans, but Napoléon took over a large part of it for the Musée de l’Armée (Army Museum). Then the Invalides came to symbolize the glory of Napoléon himself, when his remains were finally brought back from St. Helena in 1840 for burial in the chapel under the golden Dôme. His son, who died in Vienna, is buried in the crypt, his remains transferred here by Adolf Hitler in 1940.<n>The main courtyard allows access to the adjoining church of St-Louis-des-Invalides, decorated with flags taken by French armies in battle. The courtyard itself contains the 18 cannons, including eight taken from Vienna, which Napoléon ordered fired on great occasions — including the birth of his son in 1811. The cannon sounded again for the 1918 Armistice and the funeral of Marshal Foch in 1929.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
What remains for most people the ultimate monument was a resounding success right from the start. In 1889, two million visitors paid 5 francs a head to climb to the top and it has bewitched the world ever since.<n>Some monuments celebrate heroes, commemorate victories, honor kings or saints. This is a monument for its own sake. Its construction for the 1889 World’s Fair was an astounding engineering achievement — some 15,000 pieces of metal joined by 2,500,000 rivets, soaring 320 m (984 ft) into the sky on a base only 130 m (430 ft) across. At the time, it was the tallest structure in the world. It also provided the perfect perch for transmitters when radio and TV came along.<n>On the tower’s inauguration, the lifts were not yet in operation and Prime Minister Tirard, aged 62, stopped at the first platform, 57 m (187 ft) up, letting his younger Minister of Commerce continue to the top to present Gustave Eiffel with the Legion of Honor medal. Conceived as a temporary structure just for the Fair, the tower was slated for destruction in 1910, but nobody had the heart to take it down. New illumination was installed in 1985 to light up the tower from within, and it was the obvious main focus of France’s celebrations for the change of the millennium in 1999.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
At the beginning of the 18th century, Poland entered a prolonged period of decline, marked by financial ruin, a debilitated military, and a series of ineffectual kings. Poland was transformed into a client state of the Russians, and then lost much of its western territory to the Prussians during the Silesian Wars that ended in 1763. The following year Stanislaw August Poniatowski was elected the last king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Poland soon faced one of its most humiliating episodes.<n>The powerful Prussians came up with a plan to partition Poland, which gained the support of the Russians. The imposed treaty in 1772 robbed Poland of nearly a third of its lands. Yet Poniatowski recovered to preside over a reform movement that precipitated the creation of the 1791 Constitution, which restored the hereditary monarchy and overhauled Poland’s political system. The liberal constitution, the oldest in the modern world after that of the United States, provided for the separation of powers among legislative, judicial and executive branches of the government.<n>None of these reforms pleased the Russians and Prussians, who continued to covet Polish territory. Russia invaded Poland and in 1792-1793 it, along with Prussia, imposed a second partition of Poland, annulling the constitution and essentially divying up the country between them. Tadeusz Ko§ciuszko, a hero of the American War of Independence, led a military insurrection in 1794, defeating the Russians with a mostly peasant army. The uprising was quashed, however, and in 1795, Poniatowski was forced to abdicate. A third partition crushed Poland and placed the country under the control of Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Poland ceased to exist — its very name was abolished by treaty — for the next 123 years. Warsaw went to Prussia, Kraków to Austria.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Poland-History.txt
A Brief History<n>T he early history of Portugal is closely related to that of the entire Iberian peninsula. Prehistoric cultures flourished first in the north and in today’s Alentejo region of south-central Portugal. The south was visited by a number of peoples who came primarily to trade, including the Phoenicians, the Mycenaean Greeks, and the Carthaginians. The Phoenicians established a trading post at Lisbon around 1200 b.c, calling it either Alis Ubbo or Olissipo. When Celtic peoples crossed the Pyrenees in the first millennium b.c., they intermarried with the existing Iberian population and built a series of hilltop fort communities or citânias, the finest example of which is at Briteiros (see page 73).<n>The Carthaginians, under Hannibal, recruited locals to fight as mercenaries against Rome. The Romans eventually defeated the Carthaginians and invaded the Iberian peninsula. Their occupation was fiercely opposed by a confederation of Celts, known as the Lusitani, living in central Portugal. The Lusitanian leader, Viriathus, kept the Roman forces at bay until he was assassinated in 139 b.c.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-History.txt
Portugal and Spain, the planet’s foremost maritime powers, agreed to divide the world between them by means of the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas. This accorded everything lying more than 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands to Spain, while everything lying to the east went to Portugal, thus giving Portugal a free hand in exploiting the Orient. In 1500, Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral accidentally reached Brazil.<n>Trading posts were set up all along the west and east coasts of Africa, in the Middle East (Hormuz), southern India (Goa), Malaysia (Malacca), and even in China (Macau). Profits came primarily from trading in eastern spices, silk and porcelain, African gold, and slaves, as well as through importing copious sugar from Brazil and São Tomé.<n>Wealth helped disguise inherent weaknesses in the Portuguese state. It was not long before other nations, such as the English and the Dutch, began challenging the Portuguese monopoly on the spice trade.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-History.txt
The task of rebuilding fell to the power behind the throne, an ambitious and tyrannical minister known as Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, best remembered as the Marquês de Pombal. Pombal dominated Portugal as an enlightened despot, banishing the Jesuits and executing certain members of the nobility who may have been involved in an assassination attempt on the king. He abolished slavery, reformed education, and diversified Portuguese trade. Although he lost his hold on power shortly after José’s death in 1777, many of his reforms survived, laying the foundation for the modern Portuguese state.<n>At the beginning of the 19th century, Napoleon managed to drag Portugal into the heat of Europe’s conflicts. France invaded in 1807 when Portugal refused to close its ports to British shipping. The royal family fled to Brazil aboard a British ship and the British general, Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington), countered the invasions. The final battle came in 1810–1811, when the French, unable to pass the huge fortifications at Torres Vedras, retreated back to Spain.<n>The Fall of the Monarchy<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-History.txt
Toward the Present<n>Salazar’s New State began to unravel when Portugal’s former colonies demanded independence. In 1974, soldiers carrying red carnations in their rifle barrels successfully deposed the government in a peaceful coup that came to be known as the “Carnation Revolution.” Portugal then disengaged itself from Mozambique and Angola, its seething colonial possessions in Africa, and the country absorbed the million or so refugees who fled to a motherland most had never seen.<n>Portugal suffered several years of political confusion, but stable democracy finally took hold. With its entry into the European Union (formerly the European Economic Community) in 1986, the pace of development suddenly quickened. With aid from the EU, Portugal became one of the fastest-growing countries in Europe. In 1998, Portugal hosted the World Expo in Lisbon, and in 1999, further consolidated its European membership by accepting the gradual introduction of the Euro, the single currency also adopted by Spain, Italy, Germany, France, and others. Pope John Paul II paid his third visit to the shrine of Fátima in 2000 and beatified (the final step before sainthood) the shepherd boy and girl who claimed to be visited by the Virgin Mary over a period of six months in 1913.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-History.txt
Some 20 km (12 miles) from Guarda is tiny Belmonte, with a carefully restored 13th-century castle and Jewish Quarter, home to this day to a Jewish community.<n>Covilhã, a further 20 km (12 miles) south, has become a base for exploring the Serra because of its location close to the highest peaks and the ski fields. This mountainous area produced several explorers who would help form the Portuguese empire: From Covilhã came Pêro de Covilhã, who explored India and Ethiopia in the late 15th century, and born in Belmonte was Pedro Álvares Cabral, who discovered Brazil in 1500.<n>Beira Baixa<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
Évora<n>Évora (150 km/93 miles east of Lisbon) is the acclaimed star of the Alentejo. Originally a Roman settlement and center of learning, Évora is now a city of splendid Renaissance buildings, mostly dating from its heyday as the base of the House of Aviz (rulers of Portugal from the 14th century until the Spanish Hapsburgs took over in 1581). By the 17th century, Évora had lost influence and development came to a halt, preserving the city’s distinctive 16th-century palácios for posterity.<n>The major sights are enclosed within two rings of concentric walls and tucked among Évora’s great maze of Moorish alleys and squares (praças). The distinctive main square, Praça do Giraldo, is marked by Moorish arches and an attractive 16th-century fountain in its center. The tourist office is located here.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
Soon after this, the Spanish began building a thick defensive wall all around San Juan. With an average height of 40 feet (12 m), it was a formidable site, and is still one of the most impressive parts of the old city. It seems to have impressed generations of marauders; once it was complete, they stayed away for more than 150 years.<n>A final British rally against Puerto Rico came in 1797. Seven thousand troops under Sir Ralph Abercromby landed east of San Juan and blockaded the city. For two weeks the battle see-sawed. Finally, as suddenly and unexpectedly as they had arrived, the British retired. According to one version, it was all because of St. Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins. On the last night of the siege, devout local women, led by their bishop, marched through the streets of old San Juan in a torchlight parade praying for deliverance. The legend says General Abercromby heard the church bells tolling, saw the lights, mistakenly deduced that Spanish reinforcements had arrived, and fled.<n>The End of Spanish Rule<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-History.txt
Ponce<n>Puerto Rico’s second city, Ponce is as much steeped in history as Old San Juan. Founded in 1692, it was named after a relative of Juan Ponce de León, not the famous explorer himself. Ponce is a thriving port city, very modern in many ways, but it lives up to its name of “Pearl of the South.” At the very heart of the city is a jewel of an old town, well-preserved thanks to a massive and expensive restoration program begun in the 1980s. Hundreds of careworn buildings were brought back to life, and power cables were buried underground and out of sight. Along with this physical transformation came a cultural change: Ponce has become a focus for social events that celebrate Puerto Rican history and tradition; several major festivals are held here throughout the year.<n>The focus of the city is Parque Degetau in Plaza Las Delicias (Delight Square), known by most locals as Plaza de Ponce. Most of what you want to see is within a few minutes’ walk of this plaza, and cafés and restaurants for refreshments are also near at hand. You can spend a wonderful morning just soaking in the atmosphere. The park, with its shady trees, cooling fountains, and somber bronze statues, including one of Luis Muñoz Marín, is where people come to take a break from the midday heat. There’s also a good ice-cream shop on the east side of the square.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
As Las Peñas grew, San Sebastián faded. At its peak in the late 1800s, San Sebastián was one of the most productive mining towns in all Mexico, with a population of over 20,000 (today it has fewer than 2,000 residents). In 1912, governmental functions were moved to Las Peñas, and by 1819, Las Peñas was designated as a municipality, and its name changed to Puerto Vallarta.<n>Without any highways or an airport to connect it to other major cities, Puerto Vallarta remained in secluded tranquility for almost 50 years — until the 1963 filming of Night of the Iguana. The Hollywood production attracted the attention of the international media, who came looking for gossip about the torrid romances of the film’s legendary stars. Night of the Iguana’s biggest star, however, turned out to be the quaint village of Puerto Vallarta.<n>The movie’s leading man, Richard Burton, and his new love, Elizabeth Taylor, were so charmed by the town that they bought homes there, as did director John Huston. Throngs of tourists followed. Many became residents, building homes of their own on the hillsides overlooking the river and bay, creating what is now known as Gringo Gulch. Huston’s friend, the Mexican architect Guillermo Wulff built most of these homes, giving Puerto Vallarta its defining style of white facades and red tile roofs.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-History.txt
Before long, pirates heard about the riches brought to Acapulco — the port was visited both by Sir Francis Drake and the British pirate, Thomas Cavendish. Cavendish eventually captured the Nao (1587) and got away with 1.2 million in gold. To guard the port from these attacks, the Spaniards built the impressive Fuerte de San Diego in 1616. Although an earthquake destroyed it in 1776, the fort was rebuilt in 1783, and today houses a small but interesting museum.<n>The Nao trade route continued until the early 1800s, when José María Morelos y Pavón, a hero of Mexico’s War of Independence, took over Acapulco and stopped the trade, sending the town into a century-long respite, a hiatus that ended only when the Mexican government paved the highway between Mexico City and Acapulco. The beautiful beaches of Acapulco Bay immediately lured Mexico City’s elite, and the metamorphosis began, from slumbering trading port into the “Pearl of the Pacific,” as the media came to know it in the 1930s.<n>The first airplanes from the US began to arrive in the mid-1930s, and with them came a bevy of notorious visitors, from movie stars to presidents, writers to millionaires. Acapulco became the playground for the rich and famous. Glitzy hotels went up in a hurry, supported by new boulevards, power plants, and a superhighway. Acapulco’s peak was the 1940s to 1960s. Celebrated images included Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner sipping margaritas while watching cliff divers at La Quebrada, President Eisenhower meeting Mexico’s President López Mateos for a summit conference in a new high rise hotel, and Johnny Weissmuller swimming laps in the Flamingos Hotel pool overlooking Acapulco Bay.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-History.txt
