[SEP] I wasn't even sure where we were going. [SEP] I plug in my straightener and turn it on. [SEP] While I wait for it to heat, I	walk	back to my room.

or even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing; instead, all that filled his mind was the tree's constant presence in his life, growing with him and beside him, its persistent reminders that he had higher, truer things to write, the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake. [SEP] His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn, burning logs, but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes, tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers. [SEP] But he did not weep. [SEP] Instead, he bethought himself of the loss of the tree; considered also Arthur's motivation and whether some good might not come of this, after all. [SEP] Leaving the circle of ashes, he stood and turned towards the woods, in which it was his habit to	walk	when in a pensive mood. [SEP] He stepped slowly beneath the branches, a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great, swirling eddy, a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willow's last breath. [SEP] Allan wandered beneath the trees for a time, thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog, strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate. [SEP] He considered Arthur's intervention; considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested, to write stories that others would read; for after all, what purpose writing if not to be read? [SEP] And without that torturous willow, he might be free to write whatever he saw fit.

7 The future of boundaryless careers When massive economic restructuring forced William H. Whyte Jr’s (1956) ‘organization man’ to	walk	permanently out of the front doors of the corporation, many of the assumptions of a traditional career path followed shortly behind. [SEP] In the wake of his departure, people were left pondering how they would survive without a job for life, a corporate ‘road map’ to guide their destiny and the firm’s hierarchy to define their status or place in society. [SEP] Without employers’ orderly structures, external guides for action, and linear career paths, however, just what is the future of career? [SEP] When ‘the career’ devolves to the level of the individual does free agency prevail and a form of ‘career anarchy’ result?
