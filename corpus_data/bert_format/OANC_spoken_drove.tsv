[SEP] Well, we start driving in this truck, you know, I have a fairly large truck, and we're driving, and the road's at first paved, and then we're driving along, and then it goes to stone, gravel, and then, pretty much, we keep going, and it's like dirt, turns into a dirt road, and then, at the end of this road, probably the last twenty minutes, we're driving over tree stumps	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt	drive	spoken	OANC_spoken	3
