[SEP] Now, do you know approximately when you received this?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	3
And can you tell us what harm you believe that it has caused you? [SEP] Late in '04 my daughter	came	home from school, and I was discussing kind of what was going on in the district with her. [SEP] And she looked at me and she said, Well, Mom, evolution is a lie, what kind of Christian are you, anyway, which I found to be very upsetting. [SEP] Did you ask her why she said that?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	3
BY MR. THOMPSON In fact, all of the information upon which you -- strike that. [SEP] In fact, the information that you were getting about what the school board was doing in 2004	came	from newspapers. [SEP] Is that correct? [SEP] That's correct.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	3
People that I work with, other people in the district. [SEP] But you never even saw the policy until that newsletter	came	out. [SEP] Is that correct? [SEP] I got my information from the newspaper, yes.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	3
Well, you said that you were upset by the policy because it conflicts with your religion? [SEP] I said I was upset about it because I didn't find a problem with it with my religion. [SEP] It does not -- I'm getting confused. I have a problem with it because my daughter	came	home from school and she says to me, What kind of Christian are you, anyway? So that's why I have a problem with it. If you recall your deposition -- and I certainly will give you an opportunity to look at it if you don't recall it -- the incident that you're referring to, also you received information that your daughter was a member of a Bible club. [SEP] Right?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	3
ng an ethical decision to make when we walk into the classroom, the things that we say and the things that we do, and so I think that's very important. [SEP] But you can't say when you walk into a classroom, you're not teaching. [SEP] And if that's what's happening in the Dover school system and my children are in that school system, that they're routinely establishing practices that is not teaching in the classroom, then that's shameful. [SEP] In addition, I have a child who is in the ninth-grade biology class, and this has spilled over into other classes. [SEP] It's not just the biology class that has been affected by this. [SEP] My child has heard comments from other students, school board member students in her classroom about evolution being against their religion, and do you think we	came	from monkeys, how can you think we	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	3
And so your understanding is intelligent design is the same as Young Earth creationism? [SEP] Well, to my understanding, intelligent design just presupposes that everything in life is too complex, that it has to be designed. [SEP] But I also know that creationism was used repeatedly with the term -or, I'm sorry, not with the term "intelligent design." [SEP] Intelligent design	came	up after the fact. [SEP] But I do know that, in its original context, it was creationism that was being used. [SEP] And when I think of creationists, again, I think of Young Earth creationists, and I do not subscribe to that way of thinking. [SEP] And so, again, you're associating Young Earth creationism with intelligent design?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	3

First, a couple of follow-ups from the vice presidential debate last week. [SEP] Vice President Gore, would you support or sign, as president, a federal law banning racial profiling by police and other authorities at all levels of government? [SEP] Yes, I would. [SEP] The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing. [SEP] I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem. I remember when the stories first	came	out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there. And I know it's been going on a long time. In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years. But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way. And I was surprised at the extent of it. And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this. Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity. [SEP] Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core. [SEP] And it's not an easy problem to solve.

-- let's talk about my tax plan. [SEP] The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes. [SEP] And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. [SEP] That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief. [SEP] We just have a different point of view. [SEP] It's a totally different point of view. [SEP] He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. [SEP] I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. [SEP] Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute. [SEP] We pay 4.7 billion. [SEP] I can't emphasize to you how much. [SEP] I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place. [SEP] The bill finally	came	out at the end of the 1999 session. [SEP] We're working hard to sign up children. [SEP] We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state. [SEP] We're making really good progress. [SEP] And our state cares a lot about our children. [SEP] My priority is going to be the health of our citizens. [SEP] These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured. [SEP] They have not done it. [SEP] They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare. [SEP] And they have not got it done. [SEP] And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse. [SEP] The horse is up there now.

I think it's important to promote a culture of life. [SEP] I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. [SEP] I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. [SEP] I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions. [SEP] Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. [SEP] It's a brutal practice. [SEP] People from both political parties	came	together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. [SEP] It made a lot of sense. [SEP] My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law. [SEP] What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	3

There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem. [SEP] And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions. [SEP] And so I think we need to think differently. [SEP] We'll honor our commitment to our seniors. [SEP] But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy. [SEP] And recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue. [SEP] It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat. [SEP] And they	came	up with a variety of ideas for people to look at. [SEP] I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	3
But I'll never fail to protect the United States of America. [SEP] In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.

I think we've got a lot more work to do. [SEP] And as president, I will always respect everybody's right to practice religion as they choose -- or not to practice -- because that's part of America. [SEP] Senator Kerry, after 9/11 -- and this is a new question for you -- it seemed to me that the country	came	together as I've never seen it come together since World War II. [SEP] But some of that seems to have melted away. [SEP] I think it's fair to say we've become pretty polarized, perhaps because of the political season. [SEP] But if you were elected president, or whoever is elected president, will you set a priority in trying to bring the nation back together? [SEP] Or what would be your attitude on that?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	3
We're just in a period -- we've got to work to bring it -- my opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and I'm glad he did.

[SEP] And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq. [SEP] We've come, gentlemen, to our last question. [SEP] And it occurred to me as I	came	to this debate tonight that the three of us share something. [SEP] All three of us are surrounded by very strong women. [SEP] We're all married to strong women. [SEP] Each of us have two daughters that make us very proud. [SEP] I'd like to ask each of you, what is the most important thing you've learned from these strong women?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	3
