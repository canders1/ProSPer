Yes. [SEP] "They were not the board meetings, and we were not discussing intelligent design. When I	went	to some board meetings, it was several years ago. We were discussing the building project, and it has nothing to do with the intelligent design." [SEP] And then go on to the next page, and the question that Mr. Gillen asked you starting on Line 1?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	3
That's correct. [SEP] And that it was -- she had a lot of friends who	went	to Protestant fundamental churches. [SEP] Is that correct? [SEP] Yes, she does.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	3
And why did you attend that meeting? [SEP] Well, because, like I said, my husband had been a teacher at the school, and he had sort of been directed by the high school principal to attend the meeting in support of the different things that were happening. [SEP] There were other textbooks that were being adopted and controversies over them, and, you know, it was sort of a rallying thing, I suppose. [SEP] And I	went	along because I live in the district, I pay taxes in the district, my children attend school in the district. [SEP] I'm an educator, and I was curious about what was happening. [SEP] And can you recall anything that happened at that meeting on June the 7th?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	3
Now, tell us what you can recall of the June 14th, board meeting. [SEP] Again, there were many, many things that happened at that school board meeting, and I can tell you that I was very much interested in what was being said. [SEP] And so I pretty well made sure, at the beginning of that meeting, which	went	on for quite a long time, that I wouldn't miss anything, so I took care of my bathroom needs beforehand. [SEP] And I recall the meeting starting with Bill Buckingham sort of -- I'm sorry, Trudy Peterman spoke about her -- actually, hold on. [SEP] Give me one second to think about this. [SEP] Yes, Trudy Peterman spoke. [SEP] She was the high school principal at the time. [SEP] And I know that she spoke because the thing that she said seemed very similar to her graduation speech that she had said just previously. [SEP] My sister had graduated that year, and I attended the commencement ceremony. [SEP] And she had talked about Visigoths and things like that that she had spoken about in her commencement speech. [SEP] And essentially she was speaking up for the teachers and the biology textbook. 	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	3
I have briefly looked at it. [SEP] Now, my understanding is you	went	to these board meetings in June because of the controversy over the biology book? [SEP] Yeah, part of it.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	3
You said you just skimmed this biology book that was at the center of the controversy? [SEP] It was available on the table where the board was sitting, and I	went	up front and took a look at it for maybe a minute or two. [SEP] In those two minutes that you spent actually looking at the book that was the center of this controversy, was there anything in that two-minute review that you saw that you objected to?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	3
Um. [SEP] Also, we're pro- I wanna double check with Morgan, he  did  say yes  before  I	went	to Japan on buying another wireless system so that we can go all wireless, instead of the mix of wired and wireless. [SEP] And I think that's the right thing to do. [SEP] So then all those red channels there would become wireless ones?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bmr021.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	3
What are people doing, they're switching their mikes off or something? [SEP] I don't  know  what they do.

I would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it, was a really big thing to go to the movie on Saturday mornings. [SEP] And one particular movie theater we	went	to, they would show serials every Saturday, which were a continued story. [SEP] So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you, um, wouldn't know what had taken place.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	3
And there was one other sucker that cost a nickel and we called that an all day sucker, just because you couldn't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long. [SEP] And one other form of refreshment that we got, which really embarrassed my mother because she didn't know anything about this until she	went	with us to the movie one Saturday, there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre. [SEP] And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	3
No. [SEP] So we	went	out one night to the movie, but before we	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	3
This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go. [SEP] And we	went	to Open Kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we didn't have money to leave tips. [SEP] We would also drink water.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	3
Anyway, that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre, and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it's kind of a, pretty much of a spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time. [SEP] So we bought our tickets and we	went	into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat, file, all filed in. [SEP] And I just remember seeing, and I was sitting in a middle section, I was not on an end so I had girls I knew on both sides of me.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	masc_spoken	3
Sure, absolutely, sure. [SEP] Somalia. [SEP] Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and that's where the mission	went	wrong. [SEP] The mission was changed. [SEP] And as a result, our nation paid a price. [SEP] And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building. [SEP] I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war. [SEP] I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests. [SEP] But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti. [SEP] I wouldn't have supported either. [SEP] What about Lebanon?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	3
Do you have any second thoughts on that, based on what you said a moment ago about genocide? [SEP] I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first. [SEP] Fine. [SEP] We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. [SEP] My wife Tipper, who is here, actually	went	on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. [SEP] But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there. [SEP] We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. [SEP] But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim. [SEP] One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces. [SEP] We tried everything else. [SEP] If we have allies in the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden. [SEP] In Africa we did not. [SEP] Now, we h	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	3
s. [SEP] It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role. [SEP] Let me comment on that. [SEP] I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be. [SEP] We can help. [SEP] And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government. [SEP] I want to empower the people. [SEP] I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. [SEP] I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, we do it this way, so should you. [SEP] I think we can help. [SEP] I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. [SEP] But take Russia, for example. [SEP] We	went	into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. [SEP] The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. [SEP] They're going to have to make the decision themselves. [SEP] Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. [SEP] But Russia has to make the decision. [SEP] We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make. [SEP] So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	3
n the one he expressed. [SEP] But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned. [SEP] I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. [SEP] I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. [SEP] The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns. [SEP] I think these assault weapons are a problem. [SEP] So I favor closing the gun show loophole. [SEP] In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives	went	the other way. [SEP] That's still pending. [SEP] If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress. [SEP] I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law. [SEP] I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. [SEP] Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years. [SEP] I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate. [SEP] I think that we ought to make all schools gun free. [SEP] Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country. [SEP] I think that measures like these are important. [SEP] Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others. [SEP] Governo	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	3
Is he right? [SEP] Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct. And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered. And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which	went	to wealthy interests. He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program. There's -- you don't have to take my word for this. [SEP] There is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judge's language about this. [SEP] I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance. [SEP] 600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldn't sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up. [SEP] Let's let the governor respond to that. [SEP] Are those numbers correct? [SEP] Are his charges 	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	3
You know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. [SEP] We talk about fiscal matters. [SEP] But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works. [SEP] I	went	to Washington to solve problems. [SEP] And I saw a problem in the public education system in America. [SEP] They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics. [SEP] And so we said: Let's raise the standards. [SEP] We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	3
Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country. [SEP] This president has taken a $5. [SEP] 6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. [SEP] Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums	went	up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year. [SEP] But guess what, America? [SEP] The wages of Americans have gone down. [SEP] The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	3
Not at all. [SEP] Absolutely not, Bob. [SEP] This is the same thing we heard -- remember, I appeared on "Meet the Press" with Tim Russert in 1990-something. [SEP] We heard the same thing. [SEP] We fixed it. [SEP] In fact, we put together a $5. [SEP] 6 trillion surplus in the '90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security. [SEP] If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given -- President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America -- just that tax cut that	went	to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075. [SEP] The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut. [SEP] Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut. [SEP] I don't. [SEP] I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	go	written	masc_spoken	3
He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time. [SEP] I didn't hear any plan to fix Social Security. [SEP] I heard more of the same.

Everything is a gift from the Almighty. [SEP] And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being. [SEP] And people all find their ways to express it. [SEP] I was taught -- I	went	to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself. [SEP] And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet. [SEP] We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America. [SEP] There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.
