(The Llorona is coming, behave yourself). [SEP] Even adults who’ve heard the story many times and do not want to admit belief still fear a late-night encounter with La Llorona. [SEP] There are ancient texts of indigenous mythology narrated by the Aztecs and recorded by the Spaniards that very closely resemble the La Llorona legend. [SEP] In some tales she is believed to be Cihuacoatl, the patron goddess of women who die in childbirth. [SEP] It is said that Cihuacoatl carried a little baby cradle on her back, or a dead baby in her arms, as she roamed the country crying through the nights. [SEP] Those who saw her considered it an ill omen. [SEP] Sahagún mentions in The Conquest of Mexico that “a woman was often heard [as] she went weeping and crying out. Loudly did she call out at night. She	walked	about saying: ‘O my beloved sons, now we are about to go!’” (Horcasitas and Butterworth, 208). [SEP] Horcasitas and Butterworth reprint several texts of these early chronicles. [SEP] Diego Muñoz Camargo (ca. 1529–1599) also reported that before the Spaniards arrived, “many times and many nights was heard the voice of a woman who cried out in a loud voice, drowning herself with her tears, and with great sobs and sighs, wailing” (Horcasitas and Butterworth, 209). [SEP] Contemporary texts of La Llorona collected in Mexico assert that the original Llorona was La Malinche, the mistress of Cortés. [SEP] Cortés abandoned her to return to Spain, and according to the legend Malinche killed their son with a knife. [SEP] This could be the source of another characteristic of the La Llorona legend.

lt there where she appeared, the mount of Tepeyac. [SEP] To Juan Diego she was a beautiful woman who spoke his language, so after much difficulty he sought to speak to the bishop, but his story was not heard, and he was asked to return another day. [SEP] The beautiful woman appeared to Juan Diego a second time, and he was asked to seek the bishop’s audience again. [SEP] On the second try Juan Diego saw the bishop, his story was heard and questioned, but was not believed. [SEP] The bishop wanted a sign from the Great Lady so that he would know it was really she who was sending Juan Diego. [SEP] Diego intended to go back to Tepeyac and inform the beautiful woman, but when he returned home he found that his uncle Juan Bernardino was extremely ill. [SEP] The next morning, on December 12, as he	walked	to Tlatelolco to call a priest to come to his uncle’s side, the beautiful woman came to him a third time asking what was wrong. [SEP] Diego told her of his sick uncle and of the request from the bishop. [SEP] She told him his uncle was now well and would not die and sent him to the top of a hill to cut fresh flowers that he was to take to the bishop as proof of her existence. [SEP] Diego followed her instructions and at the top of the hill he found beautiful roses of Castile, still covered with dew. [SEP] He cut them and The Lady, the Mother of God, arranged them in his tilma (cloak) and sent him to the bishop, with the proof requested. [SEP] When Diego unfolded his tilma in front of the bishop, the roses fell to the floor, and there on the tilma was an image of the Virgin Mary.

rting a row of double columns capped by a deep copper-lined cornice. [SEP] Behind the colonnade, which was fitted with retractable glass panels that could be opened during warm weather, was a two-story-high hall lit by three large skylights. [SEP] The exterior had a simplicity that reminded me of McKim, Mead & White, albeit without Classical ornament. [SEP] The interior was different, with many hallmarks of the International Style: no decoration, bare concrete, exposed structural beams, factory sash glazing and steel pipe railings. [SEP] I assumed that the stark simplicity was the result of a restricted budget, and a desire to use materials that would withstand wear and tear. [SEP] It seemed pretty banal to me, and although I didn’t say anything to Jack, I was disappointed. [SEP] Yet as we	walked	around, I changed my mind. [SEP] Although the décor was tough and unsentimental, it was not crude. [SEP] There were sleek stainless-steel pendant lighting fixtures with suspended glass diffusers and stylish easy chairs covered in canvas. [SEP] In the food court, the bar and counter tops were marble, the dining tables solid maple. [SEP] Students were gathered around tables, lounging on the staircase, sprawled on the floor. [SEP] The atmosphere was hard to pin down. [SEP] This was not the precious, corporate modernism of Richard Meier, nor the contrived, technological wizardry of Norman Foster. [SEP] It was certainly not the Calvinist minimalism that I associated with many trendy younger architects.

spring and late fall, particularly on weekdays, the Great Wall at Mutianya is not very crowded. [SEP] Surrounded by its renowned green forests, it is a pleasant alternative to Badaling. [SEP] The Great Wall at Juyongguan, 58 km (36 miles) northwest of Beijing on the way to the Badaling section, is the newest portion of the wall open to tourism (1998) and the nearest to the capital. [SEP] Juyongguan contains a massive guard tower marking one of the Great Wall’s most celebrated mountain passes. [SEP] This guard tower, built in 1345, is decorated in Buddhist carvings, with inscriptions in Chinese, Tibetan, Sanskrit, and languages of the northern tribes. [SEP] Some of the temples and parks clustered at the pass in the days of the Ming dynasty have also been restored here. [SEP] The wall can be	walked	for 4 km (21⁄2 miles) as it winds over the peaks of the Taihang Mountains. [SEP] The least restored, least crowded major segment of the Great Wall near Beijing is at Simatai, 124 km (77 miles) northeast of the capital. [SEP] Not only is Simatai rather far from the capital, it is also quite uncrowded and unreconstructed. [SEP] Its stairways and watchtowers resemble those crumbling edifices one can only glimpse from Badaling, Mutianyu, and Juyongguan. [SEP] The natural scenery is dramatic, and the ruined state of the wall gives Simatai a romantic feel (although there is a cable car to the top). [SEP] It is also dangerous, with broken stairways leading up some of the 70-degree inclines. [SEP] Other portions are in such ruins that one must walk along the outside of the wall on steep, narrow pat	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	5
Vidám Park, next door, is an old-fashioned, funfair-style amusement park for the kids. [SEP] You won’t ﬁnd American-style thrill rides here, just carousels, dodgem cars, a ferris wheel, and a few other low-technology sources of fun. [SEP] A mini-version of the park more suited for younger children adjoins it. [SEP] Next door to the amusement parks, a circus makes regular appearances throughout the year.

The Blackfoot Our popular image of the North American Indian is conditioned by Hollywood’s stereotype — feather headdress, necklace of scalps, and whooping war dances around the campfire — which in fact derived from the prairie tribes, or Plains Indians, as they are known to American anthropologists. [SEP] The Blackfoot of Alberta are a classic example. [SEP] Their name, says the myth, was bestowed on them when an ancestor, on his way to meet another tribe,	walked	through land burned by prairie fire and blackened his moccasins. [SEP] For these great hunters of the Rocky Mountain foothills and prairies, wild game included grizzly and black bear, antelope, deer, elk, wild sheep, and goats, but the only “real meat” was buffalo. [SEP] Before the early 1700s, when horses appeared on the scene, guile was more important than speed, and hunters stalked the buffalo herd disguised with the skins of wolf and buffalo calves. [SEP] Horseback hunting brought new skills and prestige to an élite that had been given no other duties. [SEP] The Blackfoot went to war with Shoshoni and Crow Indians, to the south, for their horses, and were in turn attacked by the Cree from the north for their territory’s great buffalo herds. [SEP] Buffalo was everything to these tribes —	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt	walk	written	OANC_written	3
