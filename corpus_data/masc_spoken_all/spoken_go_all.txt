(The following discussion occurred in chambers:)<n>Let's go on the record. We are in chambers, and this is<n>the matter of Kitzmiller, of course, versus Dover Area School<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
in this kind of a case.<n>These two newspapers respectively go to approximately 89 municipal meetings<n>in terms of different municipalities and school districts. And<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Well, that's not my intention. And I wanted to let you<n>go as far as you could, and I think I have to interject and I<n>want to interject and I want to be clear, because I think it's<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
I didn't say this strictly in the opinion, perhaps, but my opinion<n>was not meant to allow the testimony of the reporters to go in any<n>way, in particular, outside the four corners of the affidavits<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
But I'll tell you that if it's their persistent position that they<n>don't want to testify, then we'll go on the record -- now, I'm not<n>going to put them on the witness stand. I don't think it's necessary<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
decide what we're going to do at that point.<n>I don't know what else to do, but I'm not going to go through the<n>charade of having them take the stand and assert, you know, as<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
roughly within the confines of their affidavits --<n>I go beyond that. I'm willing to have them testify as to<n>what they wrote in the article and basically forget the affidavit.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Benn, I think, fears that even this would do that. I don't share<n>that fear. But to go any further than that would mean that a<n>reporter's veracity could be questioned each and every time something<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt

"They were not the board meetings, and we were not discussing intelligent design. When I went to some board meetings, it was several years ago.

You never looked at the book Of Pandas and People before you became a plaintiff in this lawsuit, did you?<n>I didn't feel that I could look at it.

Do you recall a young man by the name of Max Pell speaking at that meeting?<n>Unfortunately I was in the restroom at the time that Max Pell was speaking because -- my husband told you I was eight months pregnant. I was actually nine months pregnant and due any day, so I spent quite a deal of time in the restroom. But I had excused myself to go to the restroom just after Barrie did this whole thing. In fact, I may have been walking out of the room at the time and in close proximity to her. And so at the time when Max was speaking -- I believe that there were people who spoke in between she and Max Pell. But at the time when he stood to speak, I was in the restroom and sort of coming back from the restroom, so I don't really recall exactly what his comments were. I know him because he was my husband's student, though.<n>Do you recall any other board members saying anything during the course of any discussion about the biology textbook?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Do you recall any other board members saying anything during the course of any discussion about the biology textbook?<n>Well, like I said, I was reentering the room from the bathroom, so I was sort of in the doorway. And I obviously didn't know what Max had said to the board but that he had spoken to the board. So the comments that were coming back were, I assume, directed at him. But there were comments from Bill Buckingham about brainwashing, and I remember hearing that, the whole thing about brainwashing, because it dealt with going to college and getting this education and students who go to college become brainwashed. And I was very upset by that because I attended college and I don't feel as if I were brainwashed. And also I recall Alan Bonsell making a comment about, you know, there are only two theories, there's this theory evolution and there's this theory creation, and if you're teaching only those two theories, then there's not a problem.<n>Do you recall anything else Mr. Bonsell said?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
And can you please tell us how you have been harmed?<n>Well, in numerous ways. First, as a teacher, professionally, I feel that teachers in general are harmed, myself, as well, because there's a dichotomy here in what they're saying about this statement that they have passed on intelligent design as they're not teaching it. On the other hand, they've said that it enhances state standards and critical thinking. In my mind, everything that you do in a classroom is teaching. And I don't necessarily think that's just in my mind. I believe that's true of all educators. The way I dress when I go to work tells my students something. The statements I make or the statements that I do not make in my classroom tell my students something. So I think we're charged with, you know, having an ethical decision to make when we walk into the classroom, the things that we say and the things that we do, and so I think that's very important. But you can't say when you walk into a classroom, you're not teaching. And if that's what's happening in the Dover school system and my children are in that school system, that they're routinely establishing practices that is not teaching in the classroom, then that's shameful. In addition, I have a child who is in the ninth-grade biology class, and this has spilled over into other classes. It's not just the biology class that has been affected by this. My child has heard comments from other students, school board member students in her classroom about evolution being against their religion, and do you think we came from monkeys, how can you think we came from monkeys. It used to be a weekly occurrence. It's now a daily occurrence, and my daughter comes home from school upset about these comments that are being made to her and, you know, is looking for guidance on how to respond to these questions. Also, intelligent design is not a scientific concept. It's a religious concept. And because I don't subscribe to that particular brand of religion, I feel that I and my daughter, my family, are being ridiculed, and my daughter feels the pressure. I reserve the right to teach my child about religion. And I have faith in myself and in my husband and in my pastor to do that, not the school system.<n>Thank you. No further questions.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
Is it your understanding that it presents Darwin's theory of evolution in a manner that is consistent with its standing in the scientific community?<n>As much as I know about the scientific community -- and, you know, you have to remember that's not my discipline. But as much as I know about what the high school science standards say, it would be in standing with that. As far as the scientific community, I really can't go there, because I know that there is a lot more about Darwin than is in that textbook. I mean, I can absolutely say that without knowing everything about Darwin or knowing everything about science.<n>Do you have any reason to believe that what's in the biology book is inconsistent with what the scientific community --<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt
You never checked?<n>There were a couple instances where friends of mine had tried to check on the status of the books in the library but were not permitted to go in at that time. So I am only assuming that those books are there now because I am being told that they are. But as for myself walking into a library and seeing them there, I did not.<n>Do you have any objection to these additional books being placed in the library?<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt

I said, I don't recall whether or not I did say that I had spoken with her after suit was filed. I mean, if that's what it says in my deposition testimony, that's what I testified to at the time.<n>Let's go to Page 68 of your deposition transcript, ma'am.<n>Okay.<n>	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt

I would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it, was a really big thing to go to the movie on Saturday mornings.<n>And one particular movie theater we went to, they would show serials every Saturday, which were a continued story.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you, um, wouldn't know what had taken place.<n>So we would go every Saturday morning.<n>And also at this theater, they gave prizes to different people.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And one of the way they gave prizes was, they would take big group photos and everybody, and there were stairs going up to a balcony, real wide stairs.<n>And the big group of people would go stand on the stairs and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture.<n>And they'd take the picture and then you would go back the next Saturday after they had been developed and they would have circled 3 or 4 people in the picture and the people whose head was circled would get the prizes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt

And one other form of refreshment that we got, which really embarrassed my mother because she didn't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday, there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre.<n>And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this.<n>We would go into the bakery and we would ask for-<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt

And that's all the stories I can remember about the movies right now.<n>I do know that I did used to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre.<n>And when I was young, it wasn't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt

And we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswomen.<n>And we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together and then when we grew up, we sure did; we got an apartment.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
But in my mind I can remember playing that, like all day long.<n>And we would go over to my grandparents' and they had a a big white house with a big front porch and, uh, banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch.<n>And it was just a great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or, uh, it could be a castle; just do many things with it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
Everybody had their own "best" friend but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together.<n>Um, and we would, had that many girls but we would only go out in a couple of cars and I remember one of the girls, Betty Belle, her dad had a VW Beetle, and we'd fit like 5 girls in that VW Beetle.<n>Did Betty Belle turn Catholic?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
We just did what we could get away with.<n>Anyway, that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre, and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it's kind of a, pretty much of a spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time.<n>So we bought our tickets and we went into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat, file, all filed in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt

Does that give us -- does our wealth, our good economy, our power, bring with it special obligations to the rest of the world?<n>Yes, it does. Take, for example, Third World debt. I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions. I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes. We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people. We can help build coalitions but we can't put our troops all around the world. We can lend money but we have to do it wisely. We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials. So we have to be guarded in our generosity.<n>Let's go through some of the specifics now. New question. Vice President Gore, the governor mentioned the Middle East. Here we're talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have.

Vice President Gore, the governor mentioned the Middle East. Here we're talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have. What do you think the United States should do right now to resolve that conflict over there?<n>The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there. We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured. We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on. I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there. The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now. It's a very tense situation there. But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there. It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue. Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there. And we just have to take it day-to-day right now. But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing. Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives. They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring. And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
I do.<n>Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power. I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there. And we have maintained the sanctions. Now I want to go further. I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it, but that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it. I don't think they should be allowed to.<n>Did he state your position correctly, you're not calling for eliminating the sanctions, are you?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
No, of course not, absolutely not, I want them to be tougher.<n>Let's go on to Milosevic and Yugoslavia, and it falls under the area of our military power. Governor, new question. Should the fall of Milosevic be seen as a triumph for U.S. military intervention?<n>I think it's a triumph. I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia. I supported them when they did so. I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy, I think it worked, and I'm pleased I took -- made the decision I made. I'm pleased the president made the decision he made. Because freedom to go in that part of the world, and where there's a lot of work left to be done, however.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt

Should the fall of Milosevic be seen as a triumph for U.S. military intervention?<n>I think it's a triumph. I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia. I supported them when they did so. I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy, I think it worked, and I'm pleased I took -- made the decision I made. I'm pleased the president made the decision he made. Because freedom to go in that part of the world, and where there's a lot of work left to be done, however.<n>But you think it would not have happened -- do you think that Milosevic would not have fallen if the United States and NATO had not intervened militarily? Is this a legitimate use of our military power?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Do you have any second thoughts on that, based on what you said a moment ago about genocide?<n>I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first. Fine. We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there. We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim. One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces. We tried everything else. If we have allies in the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden. In Africa we did not. Now, we have tried -- our countries tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we've met some resistance. We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that. But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.<n>So what would you say, Governor, that somebody would say hey wait a minute, why not Africa, I mean why the Middle East, why the Balkans, but not Africa, when 600,000 people's lives are at risk?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
No, I would make some changes. I think there need to be reforms in the IMF. I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable. And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF. The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. The governor mentioned it earlier. I've worked on this issue. It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it. And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it. I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history. The world has come together, as I said, they're looking to us. And we have a fundamental choice to make. Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader. And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years. I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus. It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.<n>Let me comment on that. I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be. We can help. And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government. I want to empower the people. I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, we do it this way, so should you. I think we can help. I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. But take Russia, for example. We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. They're going to have to make the decision themselves. Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make. So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, we do it this way, so should you. Now, we trust freedom. We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans. But maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.<n>Lets move on. No, let's move on.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Would you support a national hate crimes law?<n>I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version. But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books. That bill did -- there was another bill that did die in committee. But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime. And we're going to make sure people get punished for the crime. And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to deaths. And that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas.<n>New subject, new question. Another vice presidential debate follow-up. Governor, both Senator Lieberman and Secretary Cheney said they were sympathetically rethinking their views on same sex relationships. What's your position on that?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
A photo license I.D. like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --<n>Excuse me, you would have to get the license -- a photo I.D. to go in and before you could buy the gun?<n>Correct.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
What is not true, Governor?<n>That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending. The top -- let's talk about my tax plan. The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes. And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief. We just have a different point of view. It's a totally different point of view. He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute. We pay 4.7 billion. I can't emphasize to you how much. I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place. The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session. We're working hard to sign up children. We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state. We're making really good progress. And our state cares a lot about our children. My priority is going to be the health of our citizens. These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured. They have not done it. They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare. And they have not got it done. And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse. The horse is up there now. But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for American.<n>New question, new subject. Vice President Gore, on the environment. In your 1992 book you said, quote, "We must make the rescue of our environment the central organizing principle for civilization and there must be a wrenching transformation to save the planet." Do you still feel that way?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Where do you see the basic difference in very simple terms in two or three sentences between you and the governor on the environment? If a voter wants to make a choice, what is it?<n>I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming. He is right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes. I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies. And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that. We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said. We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary. I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way. We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.<n>Would you say it's a fundamental difference?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
I'm sorry. I apologize, Mr. Vice President.<n>You aren't allowed to do that either, see?  I'm sorry, go ahead and finish your thought. People care about these things I've found out.<n>Of course they care about them. Oh, you mean the rules.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt
Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.<n>Gentlemen, it's time to go to the closing statements. And Vice President Gore, you have two minutes.<n>Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important. This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people. And education is my number one priority, because I think that it's the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn't stop there. Because I want to give new choices to parents. To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about. If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority. If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can't do education. You can't do both. You have to choose. I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt

Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all. 82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch. 223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.<n>All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1. 4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush.<n>This president has turned his back on the wellness of America. And there is no system. In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.<n>President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this. He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1. 6 million jobs lost. He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.<n>Now, I'm going to reverse that. I'm going to change that. We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
He been a senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times. He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4. 2 trillion.<n>He talks about PAYGO. I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.<n>He's proposed $2. 2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
I propose a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.<n>Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. Two minutes. And let's continue on jobs.<n>You know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Mr. President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States?<n>I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century. And here's some help for you to go get an education. Here's some help for you to go to a community college.<n>We've expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Got four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.<n>And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. And that's what I would say to that person.<n>Senator Kerry?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
And the president just walks on by this problem. The fact is that he's cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.<n>They've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.<n>They've cut the training money. They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America. That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.<n>In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.<n>Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology. It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer. Medicare belongs to you. Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.<n>But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.<n>Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets. That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees. Why should they insure somebody when the government's going to insure it for them?<n>It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.<n>We have a fundamental difference of opinion. I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession.<n>People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down. And it was one of the largest declines in our history. And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.<n>But we acted. I led the Congress. We passed tax relief. And now this economy is growing. We added 1. 9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Sure, there's more work to do. But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners. It's not to increase the scope of the federal government. It's to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low.<n>Let's go to a new question, Mr. President.<n>I got more e-mail this week on this question than any other question. And it is about immigration.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.<n>That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families. See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.<n>It also means it takes pressure off the border. If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border. It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it's been since 1929. And the take-home pay of the richest . 1 percent of Americans is the highest it's been since 1928.<n>Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down. Now that's wrong.<n>Now, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform. He said he would reform it. Four years later he is now promising another plan.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom.<n>Mr. President, I want to go back to something Senator Kerry said earlier tonight and ask a follow-up of my own. He said -- and this will be a new question to you -- he said that you had never said whether you would like to overturn Roe v. Wade. So I'd ask you directly, would you like to?<n>What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges? And the answer is, no, I will not have a litmus test. I will pick judges who will interpret the Constitution, but I'll have no litmus test.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
Clearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it.<n>But let me go a step further. We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America. I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.<n>And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
$89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs. You be the judge.<n>All right, let's go to another question. And it is to Senator Kerry.<n>You have two minutes, sir.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
I've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith to the American people in the way that he took this nation to war. He said he would work through a real alliance. He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution. Well, we didn't. And the result is our forces today are overextended.<n>The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result. And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we're finished and much more probably. And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.<n>Mr. President?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
But I'll tell you this. I'm also a former law enforcement officer. I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America, one of the ten largest. I put people behind bars for the rest of their life. I've broken up organized crime. I know something about prosecuting.<n>And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban. They don't want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47.<n>I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, "See the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. "<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt

And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen. We'd have won what Bill Clinton won.<n>Let's go to a new question. For you, Senator Kerry, two minutes.<n>Affirmative action: Do you see a need for affirmative action programs, or have we moved far enough along that we no longer need to use race and gender as a factor in school admissions and federal and state contracts and so on?<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something. Today in America more minorities own a home than ever before. And that's hopeful, and that's positive.<n>Mr. President, let's go to a new question.<n>You were asked before the invasion, or after the invasion, of Iraq if you'd checked with your dad. And I believe, I don't remember the quote exactly, but I believe you said you had checked with a higher authority.<n>	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt
so I was a pretty lazy child when it came down to cleaning up and cooking.<n>So one night my mother asked me to go inside and wash the dishes.<n>Naturally, I start crying, and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me, either my stomach, or that I had a headache, or something was wrong with my leg.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
Once upon a time there was this little girl and her family.<n>And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up, wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table.<n>And her little girl just complained, "I don't want to wash the dishes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
The little girl disappointed her mother so badly, but her mother said, "How in the world am I ever going to get her to wash these dishes?"<n>So she said, "Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you."<n>So the little girl just said, "OK I'll go in there and wash the dishes."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
So she said, "Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you."<n>So the little girl just said, "OK I'll go in there and wash the dishes."<n>And she was in there stomping and crying and mad and taking all her good time.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
That was my dream, to teach school.<n>As I told you, in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this.<n>Uh, while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot and she said, "Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward, on your grant to go to college."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
As I told you, in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this.<n>Uh, while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot and she said, "Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward, on your grant to go to college."<n>So she said, "Go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we, you know, can follow through with applying for a grant, scholarship grant for you."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
So she said, "Go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we, you know, can follow through with applying for a grant, scholarship grant for you."<n>So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said, "Baby, I really want you to go to college.<n>It's always been my dream that my children all go to school.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said, "Baby, I really want you to go to college.<n>It's always been my dream that my children all go to school.<n>But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
It's always been my dream that my children all go to school.<n>But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money."<n>At that time my dad was in prison at the time, so it made it really hard for my mom.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
I sat there and I cried but I tried to be as understanding as possible because I knew my mother struggled really hard to even keep food on the table for us.<n>So I never got a chance to go to school.<n>Did anybody?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
I was really afraid.<n>But he told me to go ahead and try it, so I took the entrance test, and they accepted me into at the school, and I took some courses there.<n>After a while, the principal said, "I would like for you to bring me your, um, transcript so I can see what your grades are like."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
Well I didn't like writing at the time<n>but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper.<n>And I went to, um, one of my staff members and I asked her if she would proofread it, and she thought it was an excellent paper.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
I just got to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never went back.<n>But I love what I do and, uh, anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I go for it so.<n>How many different schools did you teach at?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
yeah you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like like uh<n>um a Mercedes Benz they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2071-ms98-a-trans.txt
so i don't know i'm i'm not ready to buy a new car yet but i don't know if if the next time i'm going to try to<n>to stay with buying something American or if i'm going to go for a little more<n>what i would consider to be a long-term investment<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2071-ms98-a-trans.txt
in a sense.<n>So y- you said if you - "I'm only interested in whether he wants to  go  there or not", then I just  look  at that  node,<n>look which one -<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
o- on this? or know the  location?<n>Or does he want to  go  there?<n>Let's assume this is our - our question.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
I mean. It's  always  gonna give us a value of<n>how likely we think i- it is that he  wants  to go there and  doesn't  want to go there,<n>or how likely it is that he  wants  to<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
But, maybe w- we should just  reverse  this to make it a  little  bit more  delicate.<n>So, does he wanna know where it  is?  or does he wanna  go  there?<n>He wants to know where it is.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
then we - then we might conclude that he actually wants to<n>just know where, uh t- uh, he  does  want to go there.<n>Uh, out of curiosity, is there a reason why we wouldn't<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
Based upon -<n>Or Go-there. A lot of people ask that, if they actually just wanna  go  there.<n>People come up to you on campus and say, "Where's the library?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
postulate an opinion whether<n>that person wants to go there  now<n>the  nicest  way, use a  cab,  or so s-<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
let's just assume our Bayes-net just has  three  decision nodes for the time being.<n>These three, he wants to know something  about  it, he wants to know  where  it  is,  he wants to go there.<n>In terms of, these would be wha- how we would answer the question Where-Is, right?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
And, um, in  this  case we would probably all agree that<n>he  wants  to  go  there. Our belief-net thinks he wants to go there, right? In the, uh, whatever, if we have something like<n>Yeah.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
then we would guess, "Aha! He,  our  belief-net,<n>has s- stronger beliefs that he wants to know where it is, than actually wants to go  there."<n>Right?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
Le-<n>If we trusted the Go-there node more th- much more than we trusted the  other  ones, then we would conclude, even in this situation, that he wanted to go there.<n>So, in that sense, we weight them equally<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
"The winner is<n>Timing. Now, go there."<n>"Uh, go there, Timing, now."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
Timing. Now, go there."<n>"Uh, go there, Timing, now."<n>Or, "The winner is Info-on,<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
I don't know about that, cuz that would suggest that - I mean -<n>He wants to go there  and  know something about it?<n>Do they have to be mutual-<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
Cuz I, uh - The way you describe what they meant, they weren't mutu- uh, they didn't seem mutually exclusive to me.<n>Well, if he  doesn't  want to  go  there,<n>even if the  Enter<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
Right?<n>But in  this  case if we say, " definitely  he  doesn't  want to go there. He just wants to know<n>where  it is."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
Yeah, I didn't intend to say that every possible - O_K.<n>There was  a  confusion there, k- I didn't intend to say every possible thing should go into the Bayes-net, because some of the things aren't relevant in the Bayes-net<n>for a specific question.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
Like the  Endpoint<n>is not necessarily relevant in the Bayes-net for  Where-Is  until after you've decided whether you wanna  go  there or not.<n>Mm-hmm.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
And, um,<n>Does th- th- does the H_ go b-  before  the A_ or  after  the A_?<n>Oh, in  my  name?  Before  the A_.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_Bed012.txt
