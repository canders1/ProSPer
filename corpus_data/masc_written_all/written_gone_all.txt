A defense of Michael Moore and "Bowling for Columbine" (Op-Ed)By Eloquence Wed Aug 13th, 2003 at 09:00:09 AM EST<n>This is an open letter to David Hardy, author of Bowling for Columbine: Documentary or Fiction?, probably the most comprehensive among many rebuttals of the Oscar-winning documentary. Critics have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award. Their chances are small, however, as their arguments rely on polemic, exaggeration and misrepresentation -- in other words, on the same techniques which they accuse Moore of using.<n>Dear David Hardy,<n>	#essays#	essays_A_defense_of_Michael_Moore.txt
I couldn’t see anything, I was awaiting the pit of my stomach to return. Everything happened so fast. Lining up angry wasps would’ve been easier.<n>I had no idea what was in store for me.

My first choice was a nine year old girl; Alisha was her name. She was in my ninth grade class. She had red hair, freckles and no close friends. I followed her home for two weeks, just getting to know the route and her neighborhood.<n>I picked the ideal spot, a full block under construction. And during the winter months the workmen were gone when school let out.<n>She was easy to get. All I did was call out her name and she walked over to me. One quick glance around and I struck her with a piece of iron pipe. I dragged her over to a ditch, and covered her with a piece of scrap plywood.<n>	#ficlets#	ficlets_1400.txt
Sequels: 45841<n>Melody sat up high in a tree, grieving again for the loss of her trainer, Jayden. He had been attacked by people that were looking for someone named Owen. He told them he didn’t know, so they killed him. Melody had watched it all happen, she ran after the ones that killed her, but they had talents that she did not. They were gone before she could catch them, and she ran back to Jayden. He was gone, and there wasn’t anything she could do about it.<n>So there she sat, her tears falling through the branches, splashing silently into the earth beneath the tree, sobbing for the loss of her trainer. He had beenteaching her tai kwon do, so she could learn more self defense. She knew plenty now, but that didn’t stop the pain of losing a best friend. She sat, her face buried in her knees, tucked up close to her chest, when she heard footsteps, running footsteps actually.<n>	#ficlets#	ficlets_1402.txt

Arthur raised a critical brow. "Perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy. Every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal; and believe me, Allan, you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish. There simply is no audience for fairy tales – no literate audience, at least."<n>"It is true," Allan admitted, fidgeting with his cufflinks, "that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher. I've even tried rewriting the corrupted sections, but once my characters have gone down that road, nothing can recall their former life. My prodigal ink-blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road."<n>Arthur sighed and sipped his wine. "If only you would restrain this morbid impulse of yours, you might write something really worth reading. It's hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print, like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd."<n>	#fiction#	fiction_The_Black_Willow.txt

The wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on a neighbor man. He volunteered to capture the snake. He armed himself with a rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the couch.<n>Soon he decided it was gone and told the woman, who sat down on the sofa in relief. But in relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushions, where she felt the snake wriggling around. She screamed and fainted, the snake rushed back under the sofa, and the neighbor man, seeing her laying there passed out tried to use CPR to revive her.<n>The neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store, saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches. An ambulance was again called and it was determined that the injury required hospitalization.<n>	#jokes#	jokes_jokes11.txt

Coda<n>Richard Morris Hunt was the most celebrated American architect of the late nineteenth century. His preeminence is reflected by his appointment as the architect of two important national works: the centerpiece building of the Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition, and the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty. He was feted at home and abroad. Hunt was the first architect to receive an honorary doctorate from Harvard and the first American to receive a Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects, and he was made an honorary member of the French Académie and a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. A hundred years later, his counterpart is Frank O. Gehry. Since being awarded the prestigious Pritzker Prize in 1989, Gehry has gone on to win more honors than any other living architect, including such major arts awards as the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize (a non-architectural award of which he is the first recipient) and the Japanese Praemium Imperiale, the Nobel of the art world. Even the staid American Institute of Architects, which had previously shunned Gehry in lieu of more mainstream practitioners, awarded him its top accolade, the AIA Gold Medal.<n>No pair of architects could be more dissimilar than this distinctly odd couple, the proper High Society favorite of the Gilded Age and the untidy bohemian from Santa Monica. Yet they bear comparison. They were both late bloomers. Gehry was 48 when he gained national recognition. Until then, he had been running his own office in Los Angeles for almost twenty years, building shopping centers, suburban offices, department stores, and apartments in competent but unremarkable renditions of L.A. modern. The project that brought him to national attention was his own remodeled house: a nondescript bungalow encased in an unsettling Cubist composition of unpainted plywood, corrugated metal, and chain-link fencing. The odd shapes and unorthodox materials marked Gehry as a maverick. That was in 1978. Unexpectedly, he attracted a broad range of commissions, not only residential clients, but also museums, public institutions, universities, corporations, and developers, and not only in the United States but around the world.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_rybczynski-ch3.txt
