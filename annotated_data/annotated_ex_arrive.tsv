The second tale apparently has nothing to do with the first. It describes the narrator as a young boy in the early 1950s entering in midyear the class of Paul Bereyter, his new teacher: " There I stood, in my dark green pullover with the leaping stag on it, in front of fifty-one fellow pupils, all staring at me with the greatest possible curiosity, and, as if from a great distance, I heard Paul say that I had	arrived	at precisely the right moment, since he had been telling the story of the stag's leap only the day before " (Emigrants, p. 30). It is a simple encounter that conveys the teacher's sensitivity as well as the gratitude of the narrator who, thirty years later, will be troubled by the news of Bereyter's suicide and will set out to learn his history.	say	speaker	at precisely the right moment		natural	COCA; 2003 (Fall); Fall2003 Issue 106, p102-122, 20p, 6bw; The Edge of Darkness: On W.G.

The six dogs paddled ashore, and Alika watched as they climbed up onto the bank and shook the water from their tough coats. They moved out into the closing dusk as a pack. Ideally, they'd run straight to the village, unless they encountered a bear. They'd surely attack it, Alika knew, and all six could be killed. He hoped the inuas, the always watching and listening heavenly spirits, would direct the dogs away from any prowling nanuks. Alika thought that if the dogs	arrived	safely, his papa and the other villagers would quickly figure out what might have happened.	think	3rd	homebase		natural	COCA; 2005; Orlando, Fla. :; Harcourt; Ice drift; Taylor, Theodore, 1921-2006; FIC: Ice drift
Too late Annie had discovered there weren't enough plates, cutlery or even enough chairs. And, embarrassed -- because it somehow seemed to defeat the whole object -- she'd had to call Diane and drive down and borrow some. Then she'd realized that the only table big enough to use was the one she was using for her desk, so she'd had to clear it and now all her machinery was stacked on the floor with her papers and magazines. The evening had started in panic. Annie was used to entertaining people who thought the later you arrived the cooler you were, so it hadn't occurred to her that they'd	arrive	on the dot. But at seven, when she hadn't even changed, there they were, all but Tom, walking up the hill.	think	3rd	homebase		natural	COCA; 1995; Delacorte Press, New York; The Horse Whisperer; Nicholas Evans; FIC: The Horse Whisperer 
Diana's coffin is on a gun carriage, accompanied by members of the Welsh Guard and the King's Troop of the Household Cavalry. Accompanying her as she moves, her ex-husband, Prince Charles, her two sons, William and Harry, Earl Spencer, her brother, and the Queen's sister -- I beg your pardon, the Queen's husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. Other members of the royal family and the Spencer family have already gathered in Westminster Abbey. The first lady, Mrs. Clinton, I think, has	arrived	with the British Ambassador Admiral William Crowe. Various members of what is described by the royal palace as Diana's celebrity friends are here. The news services are saying that Tom Hanks is here, Diana Ross, Tom Cruise and his wife Nicole Kidman, and Steven Spielberg said to be here as well.	think	accompaniment	with the British Ambassador Admiral William Crowe		natural	COCA; 1997 (19970906); DIANA, PRINCESS OF WALES; SPOK: ABC_Special

Rahad watched his friend as he lifted his cup to his lips. Again, something was wrong with the way Wyatt spoke. " Your English is improving, my friend, " he said. # " Gorge is not word I know.

" Life is easier if people think you just	arrived	, you know? They expect, twenty years here and you should have made it.

The first time I saw the Mercedes-Benz star revolving over Europa Center, West Berlin's triumphant commercial hub, I knew I was home. I had a room in a hotel near the main West Berlin station. I didn't even turn on the light as I tossed in my bag. I hit the heavy-named streets, delight in my stride. You would have thought I'd	arrived	in Venice. But I'd read quite a bit about how the not-old-for-Europe structures of West Berlin, stripped of decoration, felt squeezed by postwar functionalism. I pranced to the central shopping mall. West Berlin was the outpost of Western prosperity, the floating island of neon and pleasure deep inside Communist territory. This was its core.	think	speaker	in Venice		natural	COCA; 2017; Black Deutschland; Darryl Pinckney; FIC: Black Deutschland
