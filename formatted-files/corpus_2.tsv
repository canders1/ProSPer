OK. Um, we're	going	to talk about today childhood stories and what I'm wondering is what are the stories you remember as children? I recall, a number of stories.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
But I think the story that was, was a favorite was one that my mother made up herself, utilizing characters from, you know, like Bugs Bunny and, and Thumper and Bambi and all that. And ah, she, she made it up, a story about a, me and my cousin Phil, ah,	going	on this trip to the Canadian Northwest to hunt and meeting these little characters, uh, while we were there. Of course it can't be published because all those things are copyrighted, but my mother made up the story and I thought it was very nice and I still have it, uh, handwritten, uh, in our file here.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Go ahead. Well, I'm	going	to ask a final question that, um, I mean, you're my parents, and you imparted a lot of, uh, a lot of the love of reading to me. Uh, how important it was to read and we're all English majors, I think that has something to do with it; my brother, sister and I are all, we're all English majors in college.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Uh, how important it was to read and we're all English majors, I think that has something to do with it; my brother, sister and I are all, we're all English majors in college. So, what I am	going	to ask you is what was your philosophy behind that? Why is reading so important?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
At about, about three weeks later, then arrived a group of about four, at my brother's house, and told him, that they were coming to, to be, that is to take control of the place, where we lived. Well, but that they weren't	going	to steal, they weren't	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Then when, well, since I lived alone, only with my son, they, would seek me out because, I always had, everything, because I had all kinds of animals, including doves from Castile, uh, turkeys, ducks, hens, pigs, cows, all kinds of animals. So they would, they would always come to me, and they told me, "Ma'am, sell us milk, sell us yogurt, sell us cheese, or sell us a, a hog, a plump hog, well I had to sell them, and I am	going	to sell," he'd said, "if you sell them to everyone else, sell to us, too." I say to him, "OK."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So, he, he came looking for, yogurt, I don't know what he came looking for, for me to sell him. And when I was giving it to him, he said to me, "There's	going	to be, a meeting now." "When?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
"In Piedras de Sal," that was, like a, pretty, level, place where, they gathered. And I said to him, "I'm not	going	to be able to go." "Why?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I said to him, "But you know, I'm your friend, tell me why." Then he said to me that, "they're	going	to set up a board," he said to me, "where they're	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And I said to him, "And what is that for?" "Because they're	going	to set up a committee," he said to me, "so that when those big battalions," he said to me, "of guerrillas arrive, these people attend, for example, the president is	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
"Yes," he said. So, I said, "No," I said, "I'm not	going	to be able to go." He said, "But, don't you ever tell, that I told you, because-," he said.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He said, "But, don't you ever tell, that I told you, because-," he said. He motioned to me as if they were	going	to cut off his head. I said, "No, I'm not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He motioned to me as if they were	going	to cut off his head. I said, "No, I'm not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So, the next day, I left early in the morning for San Miguel, to see my daughter, and when I was coming back, I went by my brother's, which was a place in, a town called Chapeltique, and I arrived at his place, and I said, his name is Salomon, and I said, "Brother, I am here to see if you'll give me posada (lodging)," we call it, like you give someone a place to live in your own house. And he said, "What's	going	on?" I said, "Nothing, it's just that, I don't want to be there any longer," I said, "Look, it's just that I have lots of problems with the animals, I don't even have a pasture."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
"Nothing," he said, "Why?" "I was	going	to bother you," I said (), "so you come with me," I say, "I want you to do me a favor." "Uh-huh?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
You suggest something." "OK," he said, "Let me, wait for me here, I'm	going	to let dad know, and Cristobal's neighbors' friends." And he left, and that's how it was.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And he left, and that's how it was. When he came back, he said, "Yes," so, he said, "I'm	going	to leave here," he said, "from your house for Chapeltique at four in the morning with the livestock." And that's how it was, he left, at dawn, and he said, "See you there," and he left with the, with the livestock, with the, and the, the others who were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
When he came back, he said, "Yes," so, he said, "I'm	going	to leave here," he said, "from your house for Chapeltique at four in the morning with the livestock." And that's how it was, he left, at dawn, and he said, "See you there," and he left with the, with the livestock, with the, and the, the others who were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
They hid and, the soldiers came to the house. It was, when the first one arrived, the first soldier, and he said, "Er, ma'am, make," he said, "some four, six rations," he said, "because plenty of soldiers have come, and I'm	going	to inform the other houses." I stayed, making the rations of food when a group of soldiers arrives, and when I was, fixing the food, in the kitchen, because of the sun, because of the reflection of the sun, I saw, a weapon pointing at me, so that was when I said to him, "What happened?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And then the soldiers would pass through just the same. So you couldn't tell what kind, at night, what kind of people were	going	by, but you could hear clatter, because even beasts full of weapons, with, everything, you know? So that time, that I told you about when the, the soldiers came, my son escaped, dying, from fear, when I go that they had me at gunpoint, and they surrounded the house, but it passed, they didn't do anything.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
The next time the soldiers, came through, the guerrillas were in front of the house, in the road, there's one, of those huge rocks, that you can sit on, and when they were eating. When all of a sudden, a girl went by, I was washing (clothes), a girl went by, and she told me she was	going	to here mom's, her name is Victoria. And when, the guerrillas, ah, well, the girl went by and very shortly she came back.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Red-faced, tired, and red-faced, the man, and on the other side, the other end of the house, there were two others, shooting, so that, also, also stretched out on the ground. Then I said, "Dear Lord," I said, "what are we	going	to do about this?" Well, they went through, they broke a soldier's leg, you could hear his moaning.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And that's the way it stayed, the firefights there, in that place, and the firefights. Well, one day, I sai, I was	going	from San Miguel, uh, to Carolina, my brother lived, my brother was the principal of that, of that school there, in Carolina. He worked, he's a teacher, and at that time he worked as the principal of that school, of that school, because it was a, like a high school, there was, from first (grade) to high school.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He worked, he's a teacher, and at that time he worked as the principal of that school, of that school, because it was a, like a high school, there was, from first (grade) to high school. So, early that morning, that afternoon, I came down from San Miguel, and I told him, "I'm	going	to go." He says, "Don't go.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
They're making trincheras," they call them trincheras, where they're putting mounds of stones near the houses, so that the bullets there. He says, "And it's	going	to be very dangerous and it's very late." So, I said to him, "Oh, well, I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

Well, he milked the cow every morning, but that day, he couldn't milk her, because the gunfire was so heavy, and because everything was falling near the house. So, my brother said, "I'm	going	to cut her rope, I'm not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

Only Luis Alonso had gone out. Well, nobody noticed my brother until he said, "Vieja (Old lady)," he said, because that's how they talked to each other, "Vieja," he said, "I may be	going	to die," and we turned him around to see what the, the. He had a pillow, one of those big pillows, and it looked red, all of it with blood and swollen like this	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
she said to them, to the guerrillas, "Bastards!" she said to them, "because of you we're	going	to die too, through no fault of our own!" she said.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
They didn't answer. She closed the door, and Ines said to me, "What are we	going	to do with Luis Alonso?"

I've come to see Luis Alonso," he says. Because, well, no, Ines was putting up an argument that-, when he told her, "No," he said, e, Luis Alonso, "I may be	going	to die," he said, "because so much blood loss," he said. "No," he said, "I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

And they put out the, the word that yes, they had killed him. So, and if another, another person did that, they were	going	to kill him too. Because, there were a lot more things.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
When, um, I was little, I lived more, near Lake Norman side of Charlotte. If you're not from Charlotte, you're not	going	to know where that's at, but, um, it was really far away from everybody and behind the airport and stuff like that. And, um, my junior year of high sch, high school, we moved into like the city, the west side of Charlotte, and I went to West Meck, and that was a, um, culture experience, \\ I guess \\.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Because like he saw that like, I think he saw that I was like him before I would admit that I was like him. Because he knew that I was	going	to do what I wanted to do without disrespecting my parents or do anything like that because I was still like not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And `cause I was really involved in theater and stuff in high school and everything like that. And kind of like coming in to college or whatever, he kind of convinced me that what else am I	going	to do? Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Uh-huh. If I, he's like, "You're not	going	to do anything, da-da-da." He wasn't real supportive about it at all.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Then they got the whole schedule thing for the next year with the tuition bill on it and everything like that and my mom was reading it and it said, "Major THEA," and she was like, "What is this?" She knew I was	going	to do it, but Dad was pretty irate. Then I started paying him half the tuition bill.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
That's probably why I'm a theater major so I can kind of, you know, do what plays I want and then move on. Do you think they've become more ex, do you think they've accepted more what you've decided to do or that's	going	to take a while? Or if they ever will at all?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
To have something to fall back on and everything like that. And I'm like, I'm trying to convince him to, you know, if I don't make it and there's a strong possibility I won't, I know that, I'm not stupid, I'm nor	going	to go to L.A. and make five million or more than that-- Right.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Right. And do all that, and I mean, if I don't make it, my life's not	going	to be over or something, like I can't go back to school. So you'll go back to school if that doesn't work out?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And stuff like that. I'm kind of	going	to do what I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I love it! I do, but it gets to a point where like I feel like if I fail, it's just	going	to be like way too much for everybody.

Uh-huh. So nobody knows what they're	going	to be yet and considering Chris is raising them, that doesn't, you know, say too much for them two little girls. Whose girls?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
This is the fourth summer I've done it. So now I'm	going	to run three pools over the summer. A big responsibility!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
You can't go into it and be like, "Oh! I'm	going	to be a big movie star one day!" and everything like that, because the people like that are the ones that are disappointed the most and then like end up nowhere.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
That's a good attitude! Well, I definitely think you're	going	to do something with it and I want to thank you for talking to us. No problem!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AverittShannon.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Do you think there'll be a very big culture shock? I don't know that it will be a very big culture shock, because I've grown up	going	to Boston all the time. So it's almost like a second home.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, I'll definitely be ready for the change. I've been	going	up as a progress in school, so I, it will be a good change for me. So you'll stay here for the four years and then move, or would you transfer schools?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Although I do enjoy Spring and March here. How was it	going	to high school in Charlotte? Do you feel like, do you think it would have been different if you had gone to school in Boston or someplace else up north?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BlanchardTracy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
For North Carolina? They say we're	going	up in the mountains to find some snow. Really?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeIII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Uh-huh. When are you	going	to that? I think at Christmas and I'm getting a knife set.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeIII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
That sounds dangerous. But I'm never	going	to take the knives out. Oh, OK.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeIII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

Oh, we lived uh, not far from the Susquehanna River where our church was down that way, Skinners Eddy United Methodist Church specifically and I don't know if it was in the year that the king died there in '77 or if it was '78, but a flood came and course the kids were all you know told to leave school, parents would come get you, the buses ran special routes and so forth. I remember	going	down to the church and there was a group of men there that were organizing an uh, evacuation of all the valuables of the church, take them to the second floor. We had a large tractor-trailer parked out front and uh,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I fortunately remembered when Mom and I left to go to the church to bring a wrench and couple pairs of pliers because of course the pews were bolted to the floor. This as a young child kind of stunned me you know that we're	going	to go evacuate pews from a church and we're not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So, I have my sister's kid here and I'm	going	to kill him underneath this vehicle shortly. So we uh, through tremendous diversionary tactics of dragging my leg and my elbow and so forth we managed to stop just at the, the edge of the road after blistering my elbow on a big knot of ice but uh, I don't think Marsha knew about that until a few years ago I guess I don't know it's been a while but uh, yeah the snow there in the winters were exciting to say the least.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
We'd basically coasted down into town and got about 50 gallons of kerosene and pumped it in the fuel tank so that so that the fuel would actually run through the fuel lines and the bus would run. And you're	going	to school in those conditions. Right.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Right. That was uh, that was the most exciting part of you know, most important, most exciting part of	going	to school was getting there for me. Alive.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

Uh-huh. Now this is	going	back to the fifties and early sixties when you could still do that but he'd send these young girls, 10 or 11 years old maybe, down to the general store and get him a pack of cigarettes well, with the change they could buy licorice and candy and what not.

An oops. And uh, everyone you know	going	out to eat or anything like that then uh, the waiter would say to my parents, "What would you like, what would you like?" and then they ask my sister what would she like for my son.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He's their's." You know she wasn't	going	to claim me.

I would just scream and scream you know that, "No, no, don't do that." But stories I remember hearing one of uh, I believe it was Marsha uh, the wind caught the storm door there she was, she was uh, hanging on to the back storm door and I guess pulled it open a little bit to see what was	going	on and the wind caught it and threw her right out in the yard.

Uh-hum. A lot of crystal and plates and she had a plate rail in the dining room that ran around, you know so far down from the ceiling and that damn little bird would walk behind those plates and you, you just knew he was	going	to knock a plate knock off, a plate off but he never did. Chased him all the way up to the upstairs, I don't think the bird ever even pooped in the house not that we found--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And um, Grandma, my grandmother, their mother, was walking with them that night. She was	going	to watch TV. And uh, it was dark, they really couldn't see.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BranchElbert.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Umm, go ahead and tell me about a story. Well I can remember as a small child probably between the ages of three and seven	going	to Asheville and visiting my grandmother umm and my grandfather but he died when I was fairly young so I mostly remember visiting my grandmother. She lived in a small house in Asheville.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CaseCullen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I don't know those are the, the sort of stick out in my mind about visiting Asheville. Um we always tended to stop somewhere scenic either	going	to or coming from. We went to Chimney Rock on a number of occasions.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CaseCullen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And uh mostly because my dad, my dad's side of the family were Southern Baptists from the mountains of North Carolina, my mom was a Catholic from California which, oh, just scared everybody right there. So, before she even had the opportunity to meet my mom she had already decided that she was this, this evil heathen creature that was	going	to corrupt her beautiful boy um and even wrote her a nasty letter to that effect. Um, she pretty much showed a lot of disinterest at best and, and outright hostility at worst towards my mom until we the kids came along.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CaseCullen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
You're not	going	to hear yourself on the tape. ( ) OK go ahead.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
( ) OK go ahead. OK Adam is now	going	to talk about the music industry.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So I was able to get out into the actual music industry the recording industry and, unfortunately, one aspect of the recording industry, when you get started, a lot of times you have to do either very low-paying or non-paying internships to get into the recording studio. Specifically, I mean, if you want to work at, work at one of these places, they, they, uh, generally have a lot of free help, so, uh, you're not	going	to make a whole lot of money doing this and they expect you to put in a full time schedule so you really can't work another job. But at any rate, I had this, this freedom and, um, the girl had come into my life to, to go and pursue this dream, so, um, I started working at place called D&D Studios, which was known for doing, um, a lot of hip hop music, kind of stuff similar to what I was interested in and I was hoping I'd be able to make some, some connections at least, maybe do a little bit of networking there, and, uh, I met some pretty cool people, did some really kind of really interesting projects, um, but--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It was really dirty and had a reputation as being such, um, kind of a grungy atmosphere, environment, but where you could do what you wanted to do and get stuff done and what have you. From there that was kind of frustrating me a little bit,	going	into, um, sessions every day or every night and having 15 people around me smoking fat blunts, drinking forties of Old English, and really not getting a whole lot of stuff done that was, it was, it was just depressing. And, uh, seeing people with no real creative potential getting paid to do music wasn't very encouraging or inspiring to me.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
, you know, basically crossing paths on the way out as, as Kim was coming in and get to work stay at work until five a.m. come home as Kim was getting up and getting ready for work, go to sleep, she goes to work, I wake up, eat, shower and all that good stuff, and then, uh, she's coming home and I'm	going	out again. After doing that for a couple of weeks it's kind of like, "Damn," you know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
OK. What stories do you tell yourself to keep	going	through hard times? Funny, sad, whatever.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Uh, we hadn't been married long and, and we were driving down the road one day. I saw a box in the middle of the road, you know, and I looked over at him and, you know, men always automatically, you can just see them lining up like they're	going	to hit that, you know? Yep.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
' And he said, "I couldn't, it was like interstate and I couldn't, could not move over either way. I knew I was	going	to run over it."

He, um, we were in CA, and we had been in San Francisco for about three days and this is my first trip to CA. And I was just fascinated with the big city: San Francisco life, so many cars and, and the day that we were	going	the shuttle bus was taking us back to um, the airport: LAX.

Everything, you know? Because you'd hear furniture crashing, but I can remember we went straight over to the window and we still had power, but we went straight to the window and it was just, I honestly, I think, thought we were	going	to die. All right, you could see transformers popping everywhere!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I'd see film clips on TV where like a policeman got killed. He was	going	across the bridge and, you know, it was so foggy he didn't know the bridge was out and it was just there, you know, and the entire surrounding area around us was like that. There were bridges out, just, and not necessarily just a bridge.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
There were bridges out, just, and not necessarily just a bridge. Just, all of a sudden there would be a sinkhole in the middle of the highway and cars were just	going	down into it, you know, that didn't know that it was there. So if it hadn't been for that guy and that radio, we would never have made it to the airport.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
That's right. And I thought, "No security patrol's	going	to be out here." But uh, you know, my and, and, when I got out there to where the little dock was at for the paper, I could see my van.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
But uh, you know, my and, and, when I got out there to where the little dock was at for the paper, I could see my van. I parked right beside this great big tree, and all that while I worried about my van, but not enough to where I was	going	to go out there and move it. You know?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I'm like, "Nice try, Richard but my van is fine. I've been	going	over there all night long." Been checking.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

And we'd sit there and just watch. But now I wasn't stupid or nothing when the lights were	going	`shz, shz,' you know, but she's, "Get under the bed!" in her bedroom.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
in her bedroom. She's got one of those tall four-poster beds, like that w as	going	to save us, but we had to get under there a lot when I was growing up, bad storms-- Yeah.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Absolutely. And I'm afraid that all of them are	going	to be like him in the area. I mean, at least it's not, nobody likes to read like I do.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And if she reads a one-point book and takes a test on it, she misses a question, she gets point-nine. The reading another one point book, she's	going	to get, say she gets a 100 on it, she's still only got one-point-nine and she had to have two points. So, every week it seems like I have to go to the library and get these little point-five books as, I call them "fillers," just to fill in.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He said, "I promise you that I could stand outside in this yard and look across the harbor where you can see the whole bay area," and he said, "If it was quiet enough, you could swear you could hear champagne glasses clinking together." Your, I guess your imagination, you know, what all	going	on there, you know. Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um-hum. But it's always something	going	on. And, you know, it's just the culture and I'm always thinking, you know, it's not, at least they're not expecting, they are providing you some type of entertainment; they're doing something, you know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
That's neat. Yeah, just, it's just really nice to see all those things	going	on. I can remember this guy standing there and he had this little dog.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Things that you do not see every day! It's almost like	going	to Carowinds or someplace and seeing all these little, special little things, you know. But they're all over the place.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
"Forget it!" But, no, he um, one time put, he said, "I'm	going	to marinate these salmon steaks." Neither one of us had had it in our whole married life.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
"Uh-huh, that would be nice." He's	going	to marinate it and cook it later, you know. And it ended up--, and oh God!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It was awful! "I'm not	going	to do that again!" On salmon steak, I know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ChapmanDebbie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Well, because it was really interesting stuff. It was about the same time when all the space program was getting started off and I was in the first grade when the United States launched the first satellite and I was in the second grade when the first manned space capsule was sent up and because of what was	going	on at the time it was real interesting. The book just tied right into it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CheezemBurt.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I think it's important because it's the real link you have to your past and heritage and it's also declining for the same reasons you mentioned. People just don't have the time or take the time to keep the traditions	going	they just get too busy or too lazy.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CheezemBurt.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Certainly. I have some motorcycle stories	going	back two to three generations actually. And now that I know your own son is considering purchasing a motorcycle those stories hopefully can help him make // a wise decision //.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CheezemBurt.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
All right, now what? Oh I know what I was	going	to tell you. Um, another thing my mother read to us was poetry and she also had books that had songs in it, children's songs and so not only did she teach us the words to all those things, but we sang them too.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
But as they get older, I think children are so involved in other things. They're	going	to lessons for this and that, and sports, and they're playing interactive games with their computer and, uh, watching TV, and I think, really, they're not reading on their own, like maybe we did when I was that age because we didn't have all those other things to do. So I think maybe, reading for young people, is not as important.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I think it probably does, because they're just not reading as much. Um, the good students, the ones who do well academically, they're	going	to do OK anyway, but the ones, um, there are some that would really benefit from continuing their reading, either being read to or reading on their own, for pleasure-- Right.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
OK, well , um,	going	back to you, do you think, uh, are there any other ways you can see that reading and listening to stories, and literacy, um, being exposed to literacy, has um, affected you in your life? Hmm, well	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um. This is a story that my dad told me when I was small, a long time ago that, there was a girl that, she was very young, she was	going	to go visit her parents. And she was like driving on a curve.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CorderoRosalinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And she was like driving on a curve. And she was, she was	going	very, too fast, and she crashed and then she, um, she goes there, um, every year she comes out at night and then one time a guy passed through that curve and saw her and he stopped there and picked her up and she told him that if she can, if he can take her home to her parents house.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CorderoRosalinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And uh, we were all spending the night at Craig's house and uh, we decided we wanted to sneak out of the house. Well, it was about 1:00 in the morning and uh, Craig was scared we were	going	to wake his parents up or his mom up. And uh, you know after a little while we ended up talking him into it and uh, so we all snuck out his window in his bedroom and um, we proceeded to uh, go over to uh,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So we thought we were being sneaky, but uh, found out the whole time we were being watched. And uh, so after that, uh, the, uh, old man that we burned his mailbox down, uh, told us that, uh, he was	going	to, he would press charges unless we replaced and fixed his mailbox. So uh, that whole day I think we put up two newspaper mailboxes, uh, one complete wood frame and plastic mailbox and that was cemented in the ground.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
, I live out on Moss Lake, it is in Shelby, North Carolina, Cherryville actually, uh , me and a buddy of mine from way back in elementary school, we were best friends back then, uh, I invited him over to my house and we were	going	to go out onto the lake. I have a jet ski and he's got one too and, uh, so we, we went out there and started drinking a couple of beers.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And uh, we ended up drinking more then	going	out in the water and, uh, we were out in the water and, uh, we come up and we were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And, uh, at one point in time he actually runs into me on my jet ski and, uh, bends the handle bars and runs up on my legs and I got a big bruise on my legs, but I'm not feeling it then, I'm pretty well gone by this time. And, uh, it's getting late in the afternoon and he says he has to get home, and he doesn't live on the lake so we load up his jet ski and, uh, put it on the trailer on the back of my truck and uh, we're	going	to go back to his house to take it back. So, uh, we get it back on the trailer and we find out that, uh, we bent the handlebar on it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
We're like, "Yeah, yeah we're fine," you know. And uh, they're like, "All right," but they, they didn't have any idea that we were, uh, that we were leaving and we were	going	to take the, uh, jet ski back to his house. They thought we were just	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

And I was in the truck, I didn't know what was wrong. And I swerved and uh, luckily enough the truck hit the front fender somehow and I bounced off the telephone pole, and it was still	going	and, uh, I had no, I mean I was just totally in shock.

Um, I don't know how much I'd be into reading to just, you know, like a, a program of just reading to children kind of thing. But when I do have children, I'm	going	make sure that either, um, you know, my wife reads to them or that, you know, or make it a point that I read to them `cause I think it's, it's really important. And actually, uh, my sister has two young children and, um, she's constantly reading to, to her child and, who's two years old now.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And she just seems like a pretty bright, intelligent kid compared to some other two year olds that I've, that I've encountered. Are there any personal stories about your past and history and growing up that you're	going	to tell your children? Um, yeah.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, yeah. I'm sure that there's	going	be stories that I'll, I'll tell them about. Um, to tell you the truth, I'll definitely tell my kids, you know, things about, you know, stories about when I was growing up and maybe some things that, you know, you should or shouldn't do.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, in particular I could, I could think of a few things. Um, I know when I was really younger, I'll tell them this story, about never	going	near, uh, a frozen pond because when I was really young, um, the lake by my house had frozen over, actually it was just a pond, but it was a pretty big one, um, and we always use to play ice hockey and what not on it. And it started to um, get warmer outside, but there was still a layer of ice on top of it, and a bunch of my friends had gone out on to the, the dock.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I remember general things, I remember one time, we were at the shore, my fam, my grandfather had a house in Stone Harbor and there was a hurricane and I remember, um, you know, we moved all the furniture inside for the hurri, hurricane and we went out and he had an awning over his porch and, you know, and we, we double-tied the awning down. During the hurricane we'd go out and check to make sure that uh, uh, you know, all the strings were still tied and the awning wasn't	going	to blow away, but I don't remember, you now, I don't think we'd sit around and telling that story I mean, I occasionally mention that. "Do you remember?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichDavid.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It seemed like it. This was before, this was when my grandfather and her weren't married so we would go over and read it with me I was not even sure what was	going	on, but um, , but I just remember having to read that and that was it um, with her.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichMegan.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I was living, uh, right outside of St. Louis, between Jefferson City and St. Louis, MO. Um, my parents had a small house on a very friendly suburban street and, ah, one summer day I remember	going	out to the back of our yard, which seemed really big then. Uh, I reached into my parents small garden, it had quite a few tomatoes in it, and I just started lobbing the tomatoes over the fence, and I kept lobbing the tomatoes over the fence, and then my next door neighbor, who was probably about four, my playmate at the time, he rode his Big Wheel down the, down the hill there and came and started throwing the tomatoes with me and we were just having a great time not thinking about anything, laughing having a lot of fun	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He came, he opened the door and I remember looking back and seeing the expression on his face, and I could tell that he was disappointed. He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't, I wasn't really sure if what I had done was really, really wrong I just knew that he wasn't very happy about what was	going	on by the way he opened the door and by the way he told me I needed to come into the house, and I, I came over there and I stepped up and I didn't even say, "Bye," to my friend and was probably not into that kind of thing I didn't really notice at that time probably I just went into the house. And Dad said he had noticed, he had seen me throwing tomatoes in Mrs. Faulk's yard, so he told me that I was in trouble and I was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't, I wasn't really sure if what I had done was really, really wrong I just knew that he wasn't very happy about what was	going	on by the way he opened the door and by the way he told me I needed to come into the house, and I, I came over there and I stepped up and I didn't even say, "Bye," to my friend and was probably not into that kind of thing I didn't really notice at that time probably I just went into the house.

I remember, yeah I remember that based on later conversations that I ( ) with him about it, but at the time I guess I really wasn't sure what it was about, but I knew that when it all came down to the bottom of it, I knew that what I had done was the wrong thing to do and he told me that I'm	going	to probably have to go down there and help Mrs. Faulk pick up the tomatoes when it's all said and done, and I remember being a little bit nervous about that. I didn't really know Mrs. Faulk very well she was about 80 and, ah, she was a nice person I had seen her a few times but I was really nervous about that.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
There was a, ah, a rose garden back there and my sister, it's ironic her middle name is Rose. Her name is Christy Rose Farrow, and she was back there with me and we're	going	back and seeing these roses and Christy was smelling the roses and she started to put the petals up her nose, and I remember watching her put the petals up there, and I remember watching her put the petals up her nose, and I wasn't really sure why she was doing it. I didn't really ask any questions I just thought it was interesting that she was putting the petals up her nose, and it kind of became fun to kind of cheer her into keep doing it, so I was like keeping	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I think she was most unhappy with me because, you know, ah, ah, Christy was only one or one and a half or two and I was the big brother so from there I guess I remembered mom being upset with me because ah Christy had all those petals up her nose and it took a long time to take them out there was a lot of them up there, but, ah, later on, as I grew older, we moved around a lot when I was a kid I remember the first day I woke up and there was a moving truck. One day I woke up and there was a moving truck in my, in my yard and I woke up to this sound of that and I looked out the window and there's this moving truck and there's people moving stuff in and I got up and I said, "Mom they're taking our stuff," and I was, and she was like, "Yes, we're moving today," and I was about four	going	on five at the time and so they're taking our stuff out so anyway we moved and they took all our stuff out and moved and she said, you know, "I told you we're moving. You must have forgot," and I must have because it totally took me by surprise, and we ended up at a new place and I remember this, this new house that we were at and, ah, in a pretty area and it had a much bigger yard than the one.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I can't remember what it was but I suddenly got really nervous that I was about to go to school for the first time and that was probably the most stressful day of my life. I had forgotten that I was moving to a new place and I had forgotten that I was, uh,	going	to be	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, when I was young we used to go on a lot of yearly vacations. Every year we'd go from, whether it be MO to IL or IO to IL or KS to IL, the whole time I was growing up because in IL that's where my grandparents lived and every year we'd go up there and spend about a week with them in the summer, and we'd also go down there for Christmas too, but mostly I remember	going	down there every year, um, for the summer and it was, ah, a lot of arguing in the car, and I remember sitting next to my, uh, I had two sisters, so the middle one was always in the middle, for some reason. She was, she was, uh, the middle one's always in the middle.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, um another memory with my family that I have is that we had a lot of weddings, ah, and these weddings were always really big weddings, and I've always been told the reason why they're so big is because basically it's Polish, you know. Half of my family's Polish, so Polish, we have big weddings and I remember at my cousin's wedding I was like 12 years old	going	to it and I had a my cousin Tim and he was about 10, and, ah we went to this wedding and it has like 200 people. My uncle, he's a great guy.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and the reason it was bottoms up was because, was, they serve champagne to everybody in these weddings that's something I can never figure out and if you're a kid you get champagne, if you're an adult you get champagne. Everybody gets champagne and some people don't drink it so what's left the kids drink so we were	going	around drinking all this champagne. And before you know it it's time for the kids Hula Hoop contest and they've got a stage of course there they do it's one of those huge areas and ah we get up there and they're playing this tune I can't remember what it was and Tim and I were up there and Tim my 10 year old cousin is really drunk and he fell completely off the stage I remember that being somewhat embarrassing but looking back on it I think it's really pretty funny, um, it was uh it was a really neat experience.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So anyhow, I think I spoke to Ramona again. No, it was just that one time in the morning, and she said that she was	going	to come back to the office. Well, I wasn't even thinking about that, but I was so frustrated, and, I ended up talking to him again.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He didn't say a time again, so he just got me over there stressing out, and I really don't even know when it's needed. But I was like, forget it, I'm	going	to eat lunch I was hungry. Usually you feel like you have to work through, like you just have to keep working because he needs it even though it wasn't your fault that he gave it to you at the very last minute, you know, I was like ( ), and then Lana calls me in the kitchen telling me Ramona had gotten here and I didn't even know she was coming for sure.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And then I heard him leave, so I'm still finishing what I had to do. And here I am thinking he's	going	come in there and be like, you know, just have it out with me, you know, just tell me off like how could I not have this done. Even though I don't see how he could have expected me to have it done.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And I was like, "I'm almost done." He was like, "All right, well I'm	going	go out and run some errands, and um, just put it up on my shelf, and um, if I have any review notes I'll give them to you in the morning. And I was like "OK," and that was it!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Is it like that all the time? Yep whenever he there, um, which he's not there he's there most of the time but he is gone a lot but whenever he is there, and especially if he gives you something to do it's like you don't even want it because you know it's	going	to be that way and it's like other people hesitate to come through because they don't want to have said something wrong and then you go back to him well like, you know, such and such helped me and it's not like you're ratting anybody out you're just saying you know such and such helped me and that's how I got to this number but it's like people are hesitating basically and it's really frustrating. So what is it that they wanted you to do?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
We were doing, um , we were doing today it was, um projections it was financial statement like balance sheet and income statement projections for a company that, um, this guy was looking to buy, well he gave us the information that he had projected numbers for 2002- 2003 and we had to put those numbers into financial statements, basically saying they are	going	to have this much, um, this many assets and liabilities at the end of 2002	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

And you know, they were a close family and they loved each other and all that kind of stuff, but it was just down the road, you know, so they said fine, and, and you, you know, he came back on Sundays and he was with the family at church and all that sort of thing. Um, but, ah, one day he didn't show up, on Sunday, uh, for church and so they wondered what was	going	on and they went to this house, ah, down the road and the cousins had packed up and left. They had just gone.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He didn't know how to get in touch with them, and he said, you know, you know, as he grew up, you know, he kept thinking about them, and he said he wanted to come back home but he didn't have any way, he didn't have any money. And he said finally he know, you know, once he got grown and started working, he saved up his money and he said he was determined to come back and find them, and he didn't even know if they were	going	to be in the same place\\. Wow.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Wow. But he said he was	going	to find them, and he came all the way back. Do you have an idea what year that would be?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Her sister could pass for white, and in fact did pass for white. And Granny used to tell the story about how her sister and her sister's husband decided that they were	going	to move to the city, to Augusta, and pass for white. And they moved downtown--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And they found this house or this apartment building or whatever it was that they could live in, and it was right on the edge of Broad Street. And, uh, they kind of actually stopped visiting the family because they were just, just determined that they were	going	to be white. They just didn't like what it was like being black in those days, and that was, you know, I guess, that, that was probably, you know, in the early 1930s, uh, when they did that.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Than the ones who were lighter. And actually when we, we kind of began to understand what was	going	on because my cousins were a little lighter, well they were somewhat lighter than we were, and she would not treat them well and we couldn't figure it out, what, what was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
, he was a minister's son, so he had, they had property, and stuff, and they were very well-connected in the community and very, held in high esteem. His father was like, uh, the guy who had been pastor of this big church for a long period of time and, and, and so I think her family, the Tates, really wanted to connect with the Keenes for that reason, and so they just really just told her she was	going	to be marrying him. And, she didn't really understand.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FlonoFannie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

The rest of us after, uh, after we got the trigger out, why we, uh, would bale out of the aircraft, regardless whether if it was water, over land, air or what, but the bottom did go in. I want to say that there wasn't any danger of	going	in with the bomb because it would not explode, regardless of how hard it hit the ground. Even if the aircraft was on fire, why it, it would uh, burn and it would melt through a lead component for the radiation to leak out.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It's a little screw which set an injection but the, the breathing pressure tube to the pilot and counter pressure. Each pilot has a different breathing capacity and we would have to, uh, uh, bend then individual over in the pressure suit uh, uh, I'd have to have to set it for, uh, a second, or which was	going	through school. Then he'd dress me, and, uh, he'd set the injection on me and you, uh, uh, we'd have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then we'd come up breathing as hard as we could, and you better if uh, the, the, the top portion of your helmet surged, which you had rubber around the neck and the visor closed.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Then he'd dress me, and, uh, he'd set the injection on me and you, uh, uh, we'd have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then we'd come up breathing as hard as we could, and you better if uh, the, the, the top portion of your helmet surged, which you had rubber around the neck and the visor closed. And, uh, if it surged and just kept surging it would go 'whish,' and, like it was	going	to pull your head off. You'd better get the little screw turned down a little bit because you could damage and individual's lungs very easily.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And, uh, but, uh, I would think, at night I couldn't sleep. I would think, "Well, I'm, I'm	going	to let somebody else go," but then I would think, "My God!

This was the first time that, that had happened in 75 years, that TX legislature had voted a military unit being TX Ambassadors, so, needed TX Ambassadors. Late 1962, uh, I got orders to go to Washington, D.C. I didn't know what I was	going	for or anything, so was to report to a designated place in Washington. Uh, I went ahead up and it was highly classified, even my orders were classified.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I, I just didn't I was just puzzled. Of course I came back, after a week, to Laughlin Air Force base, and then shortly thereafter I got orders I could bring my family and everything to Las Vegas, NV and I couldn't tell my wife or anything about why I was	going	there because I didn't know. And so, we moved to Las Vegas, NV, and I reported, just like I did in Washington, to a certain address in downtown Las Vegas.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
They told me that, uh, that I would be called in a guy at the end for me to meet. It was another GI and said I would go with him on Monday morning to a certain location, and we never was for many, many years, we could not even mention the location, but now I have the declassification of it, Roadrunner's International right there in it's authorized, and it tells all about the A-12 Blackbird crew that I was	going	to in early 1963 and I guess it was the most classified thing that there was at that time in the United States but when I got out and gone out found out what was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Where, I didn't know what the code was, but, of course, I'd take it and turn it in to individuals back at life support but I know that I have measured them and they told me he had 300 degrees on the top of his head. But you have to remember, he had a tremendous cooling system	going	in to his full pressure suit and	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
All of our pilots flew on radio silence, period. And, of course, they were	going	so fast they couldn't move up and down but evidently they got, uh, word back real quickly by mashing the scrambler, a button on the inside of the aircraft. I don't know that; I never was told that, but CIA got the word quick like that, but they never could shoot him down anyway, and they have never, never.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Well, Alex, the youngest, of course he's just so sick of being in this truck, he says, "Get me out of here," you know, just, "Let me out!"

You guys can go, go down to the lake, just be careful." And, uh, so they kind of walked over to the hill, kind of started walking down, and at a point they just had to sit on their butts and kind of slide down, and the trees were all cut, so they'd grab trees as they were	going	down. And, um, I was just watching them, and I was up at the top, and then, I started down, I'd figured, let them go first, then I'd, I'd go kind of behind them.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FunkBernie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

She never gave up and, you know, she went through all the treatments, and then, well, then a funny thing relates to that story like, well then the whole story is not funny. But we had, the two or three weeks before, we wound up,	going	to the hospital a lot, we knew her time was short. And then, every time I wound up driving into Manhattan, you know, we lived on Staten Island, so I was driving into Manhattan, and every time I would park on the street, I would get a parking ticket.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GavinJeff.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

And then, um, a neighbor that lived across the street from me, her husband was a member of the Jump Club; Steve was "jumping" then, and she had a cookout one night, invited some people over, and I went over there and, um, I think I was the youngest one there. They were all	going	out to a club or something and I wasn't old enough to get in, but I went with the rest of them. I think I was kind of at the end of the line and I snuck in anyway and Steve thought I was really cute.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And all my aunts and uncles and cousins came up to help move in and work on the house. So we had a weekend when it was like 12 of us staying there with one toilet, the hose	going	in through the kitchen and piles of dirt and then the porch wasn't finished and we had boards	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

He talks about being in the Depression and they were very poor, and they had to get coal. They had to uh, heat their house and there was a place where the trains had to slow down on this hill as they climbed with, with coal	going	to New York City and the kids would get on this train with big sacks, big heavy sacks called burlap sacks and they would steal coal from the train, put it in these big bags, throw the bags off jump off before the train got rolling fast again to go down the hill. And that's how they kept warm in the winter, and the winters were very severe.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoedekeThomas.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And I would walk along the road to school and convoys of young men would, uh, ride by in the backs of trucks and I would wave at them and it was not a sexual thing in those days. It was just a friendly thing that these were young men that were	going	off to war all of them, most of them, well all of them enlisted men or draftees. I can remember one time specifically that, um, my dad, we had two, had a three bedroom home with one bath.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I wish I'd kept them. Another experience that I remember very clearly was riding on the train from, we were	going	down to see my grandparents at Bradenton, Palmetto, FL actually below Tampa. And we would go down there and spend about a month or six weeks every summer on a train and we had to change trains in Jacksonville, FL.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And there's one last little thing. Sunday morning we're picking up all our grandkids and we're all	going	out at 4:30 a.m. to watch the meteor shower.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
to watch the meteor shower. It's	going	to be an adventure and then we'll go to McDonald's for breakfast. That's good.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So he raced back to the house to get my mom and get the car. Well, they came and got me and took me back to the house, and my mom, I, I was shaking and stuff, my mom was afraid I was	going	in shock, so she put a blanket around me, and she was like, "Kevin are you OK?" and I was like, "Yeah I'm OK Mom.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
She was like, she was like, "OK you got to go to the hospital." So I started	going	nuts .	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Just flipped his bike. So they took me to the hospital room, and I'm	going	nuts people are having to hold me down while they pull as, asphalt out of my chin-- Oh gross.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Did they put you to sleep? Nah, well like that night they told me they'd let me go home and stuff from the hospital, and my, I mean my, before I went to bed my dad was like, "Well you got to go see a specialist tomorrow," and I was like "Wh, what's he	going	to do?" and he was like, "Well he'll just tell you you're	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

Yeah I did too, actually. Well Doctor Trevez was like, "Well, we are	going	to have to wire your mouth shut," and I had never heard of this. This freaked me out	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And what scared me the most was when he said before he put the I.V. in my arm, before he did, say before he did surgery, before he was	going	to do the surgery, he said, "OK uh, let's have a word of prayer." Yeah I was like OK, please.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I was like, "Wooh." You thought you were	going	under. So I, so I did, I never heard him finish the prayer though.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GreeneKevin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
In fact, I, um, when I got to high school, which was in VA, I, um, I remember beginning in the biography section and just starting with "A". And just reading each book and, um, just keeping on	going	until I got to the end, and, um-- Boy that was a real task wasn't it?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, my husband and I both tend to be very critical when it comes to story lines and stuff like that. And while we're watching something, I'll say, "OK honey, what's	going	to happen next?" Or I'll tell him what I think is	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And while we're watching something, I'll say, "OK honey, what's	going	to happen next?" Or I'll tell him what I think is	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I really don't want to, um, watch that show any more! So it basically, uh, turns you from the, um, plot instead of	going	with the plot. It just turns you away from it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And my family is chomping-at-the-bit ready for me! "When are you	going	to publish?" And when it's ready, it'll be ready, and I really can't rush that.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I wasn't so much even, I, I did not even know how to, I wish I could put my hands on it. If I had of thought about it, I had no clue that we were even	going	to talk about him. I think, where in the world do I have that?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
For the most part I think it's pretty clean and that's something else I really appreciate, is, when I don't have to do deal with a lot of profanity or unwholesomeness. You know, there is so much that you can write about that's good and wholesome and intriguing without	going	into the areas that are unprofitable that, um, and I don't, I haven't read The Foundation again in, like, probably the last five years, but, um, periodically I'll feel like, "I've got to visit this book again!" So, you don't mind re-reading?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
But, um, it's, um, and I'm trying to think the theater uh, other than Fiddler on the Roof, of course I haven't seen a lot of different things, but, um, has not had the same level of impact, I guess. Uh, uh,	going	to see The Fiddler on the Roof, of course, as a violinist, that, you know, was part of our, our class, um, project, and that was part of our appreciation. They also had a full orchestra.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
"That's not how it should have ended!" Not that everything has to have a happy ending, it just has to have a, a Bible solution of, one of the things	going	back to The Foundation Trilogy, in their closing chap, chapters, well, it's like two chapters that end the book. The chapter before the last chapter is, is titled, "The Answer That Satisfies".	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I appreciate not having to deal with vulgarity. I mean, you can, you can be realistic without	going	into great detail. I think about the ugliness of life.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So I'm familiar with that particular book. Um, in your high school years, you're	going	back to that time period and your librarian was one that you said who encouraged you and you had some challenges between each other in writing poetry-- Um-hum.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And so, um, I found it kind of like being the librarian helper because I was there all the time. And, uh, I, as a matter of fact at one point I was	going	to go into Library Science. I was just about to ask you!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um-hum. And I'm, I'm now with Ron's collection and mine, I'm starting to go into his area and pulling off the shelves, books that he's collected and	going	to read those. Ooh!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
But, I think, about the time I started first grade he stopped traveling, and my little grandmother Tina, who ruled everyone with an iron hand, had been living in what we called "the big house." I'm, I'm	going	on too much. But, anyhow, moved her over to the cottage so my parents could have a little life of their own, and the little cottage was right across one of the lawns from us and her other son lived in a little house down from the cottage.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
That Anne and I split up when she died. She didn't specify who would get what, and when she died and the time came to settle up stuff, Mom said, "Ok, how are you and Anne	going	to do this?" And so we said, "We'll flip a coin and see who goes first."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Because I know my Granny grew up in Cabarrus County on a farm and was one of three or four kids, and she inherited her father's mother for a season out of every year. Poor old woman would come all wrapped up in layers of clothes, and my mother told me this not long before she died, but she said when she was little she remembered her granny showing up and her mother saying, "The first thing I'm	going	to do is unwrap this cocoon." She wouldn't have changed her clothes since the last time Granny had seen her probably--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
they all had stories of their own. I don't, now, let's see which one was it, I'll tell you this one last story because it's a great story	going	back to the Civil War. And it might have been this very woman, who, when she was a little girl, this would be my great-grandmother,	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
They presumed dead, the war ended, he never came back, they never learned what happened to him, and so she took up with this, I guess he was a traveling salesman, with a wagon and a mule. And she put her two children, Maryann and her little brother, Maryann was about 12 and her brother was about eight at this point, and they took, they moved down, or were	going	to move down to Georgia. But he, what happened?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And she took in laundry and raised her family as best she could. My grandmother Tina was like the youngest of these kids and she was, I guess, eight or nine when this happened, but they, everybody, I mean the Indians were part of the community, although they kind of kept to themselves, but they knew what was	going	on and they would have dealings with the settlers. Well, my grandmother Tina, who was a little girl, got sick with some fever, and her mother was staying up with her night and day and was just exhausted.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
We went to the beach, did some shopping, I think, and exploring, but then, uh, I think the next to last night, we decided to have a special like, a special camping, end of camping trip dinner and we got everything all	going	. We were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
What? I was kind of, well I this was really dangerous as it turned out, and I wasn't sure what I was	going	to do. I would fall down and slide and somehow get bounced back up.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
This is Candace Walton. I'm interviewing Debra Hicks on November 24, 1999, and she is	going	to tell us a story that she remembers from her childhood. The story I'm about to tell is about this little girl.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HicksDebra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, she had very big dreams of wanting to become a lawyer one day. Um, she, was, at the time, there was a lot of racial tension that was	going	on, so she felt like she wouldn't be able to make it. She was kind of confused of what background she wanted to u-, what ethnic background she wanted to use, so she decided to use her black heritage, um background.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HicksDebra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And so she moved to New York and she went to school there, she made it through school and she did become a attorney. She later was	going	through problems because they found out that she was a black ethnic and not white, so they would, she could no longer work with the firm. Um, they had no sufficient reason as to why they wanted to cancel, didn't want her to be, um, the attorney.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HicksDebra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Okay, this is Paul Martini. Ah, it's ah April 14th at about six o'clock on Friday and we're here with Sam Hodges and he's	going	to tell us a story he heard ah when you were a child, is that right? Yeah, basically when I was a child.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HodgesSamuel.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Now picture this. There's about six or seven of us, little kids, eight-years old, this is a man that's	going	to be giving a good story. Right.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HodgesSamuel.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He's got his arm and uh he's trying to put it on his body and it didn't fit and it's too short and it didn't look like his arm so he throws it aside and goes on. Um, this happens all throughout history and he was telling us how it keeps	going	on and on. And you know as an adult it's not, it's, you know, he, it's a good story but as an eight-year-old kid you're worried about your arm.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HodgesSamuel.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, some remembrances of growing up in the Charlotte area. Um, I'm	going	to share a few little stories I remember, uh, happened at Christmas time. I remember my dad telling a funny story about my brother, my oldest brother, and they had purchased this huge like little general store type thing that had all these, um, boxes and cartons and stuff that you would put together, and, um, it was actually like a little store-front thing.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
or something. And, um, so, of course, a three-year-old is not	going	to stay right anywhere and I just kind of, you know, wandered down the aisle looking at something else or I may have turned the corner, I don't remember. And, of course, you know, after whatever it was lost interest for me I looked up.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
before I would go anywhere with my dad again ever. I mean I was just convinced he was	going	to lose me and every time he would ask me to go somewhere I would be like, "No you're	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Testing, one, two, three, four. I'm here with Sean Jamieson he's	going	to be the third subject and I'm just making sure this recorder's working good. OK we're here with Sean Jamieson he is the third subject here in the, um, project and Sean is from Chicago originally.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And only a minority, I guess, are Southerners and uh my friends here are, tend to be people from other places as well and rather than, rather than, ah, Southerners or Charlotteans, so I don't, ah, I'm not although when I'm in the store and when I'm out and about in other places yeah I hear the Southern accent but I don't I think my speech patterns are probably pretty much set at this point and, and I don't think I'm picking anything up. OK, so and we're talking, we're talking about, um, I guess	going	back to Chicago and um your, you want to talk about your family //um on your dad's side. //	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Every year, yeah we do a reunion every year. And it was, was my, my aunt who owned my Aunt Pat who had the, ah, my grandparents' old house, who was instrumental in getting these started and keeping them	going	because she realized she told me this just within the last couple of years that she thought it was very important to have the reunions every year so the family would stay in touch with each other cause otherwise I would never have known my cousins because the only things we might have gotten together for would be maybe at weddings and funerals which are not good opportunities to do much mixing and mingling because there are other things on the agenda. At a wedding or a funeral it's really hard to catch up with people.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So my aunt had been, had been real smart about, about scheduling those every year and trying to get as many people there as possible so that we all, ah, kept in touch and we all know who our cousins and our relatives were. So who's	going	to, ah, start doing that, who's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So who's	going	to, ah, start doing that, who's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Ah, one of my cousins apparently is, well, two of my cousins are, are keeping it	going	in fact. I just had a phone message tonight from my dad saying that the date has been set for this August on the reunion and, ah, it's not clear who's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I just had a phone message tonight from my dad saying that the date has been set for this August on the reunion and, ah, it's not clear who's	going	to host it but, ah, there's still quite a large group of family members in this city of Guelph and somebody is	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Ah, the reason that, one of the reasons my Aunt Pat was always good at being the hostess for it is that the family had, there are two small houses on four big lots on this dead-end street, so there was a lot of room for everybody to kind of spread out, put up a couple of tents or shelters or whatever, have barbecue grills out there, and, uh, a couple of houses to run in and use the bathroom, whatever, so there's just a lot of room and, uh, but it's not clear if that house is	going	to be sold or not now that my aunt has, ah, passed away. Apparently in her will she said that the house should be sold and the money given to a, ah, couple of my aunts and it's not clear if a family member is	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Uh-huh. And then, ah, I guess the family reunion is, when is the next one you're	going	to go to? It's August 12th of this year, August 12th of 2000, and, uh, don't know, don't know too many more details about it and don't know if I'll be able to go.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It sounds simple breaking your hip but you just, it is, I, I'm sure, you know, older people who've had that happen to them, you get into the hospital and you end up catching an infection or something like that from somebody else and your immune system is kind of weakened and she just, um, um, didn't make it unfortunately. It sounds like a big loss for the community just because there was so many people and she organized the family reunions but you know at least you know you've got somebody that's	going	to take over and start putting that back together there. Yeah but Aunt Pat was definitely the matriarch of the family.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
The bumper cars were a blast. We kept stalling and bumping and	going	around in circles, and we just had a wonderful time on the bumper cars .	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
The kids had a blast. Everybody was	going	crazy. It was a fun Fourth of July.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It was a fun Fourth of July. I was afraid I was	going	to step on a hot firecracker because they were all over the place. People weren't even looking where they were shooting them off.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So, we went back to the room and we all fell asleep. We were	going	to have to leave the next day, so the next day we decided to play on the beach until late in the afternoon and late in the afternoon we decided that we had better get on the road.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JandaJanet.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And, and we, we're still headed outbound, we cross over, um, we cross over Idlewild and, um, no actually, no this is right prior to Idlewild and he's running 60 miles an hour. And then he goes, he starts	going	65 as we, as we cross over Conference. And so I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

So I try to get in, get on the, the radio with Charlotte. And as I'm	going	down the road 65 miles an hour I see the Charlotte police officer on the right hand side sitting in front of, uh, um, that shopping area right, right prior to Conference. Is that where the Harris-Teeter's at?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I don't feel comfortable anymore. I'm	going	to go ahead and 22 the chase." 10-22 is `Disregard the Chase,' you know, go ahead and, and let back.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
We get to the Petro, we get to the Petro, now the BP station at Idlewild and 51, he makes a right heading towards Union County. And, uh, so we start heading down that way and, uh, we're	going	on down Idlewild Rd, keep right on	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Not really, but, uh, they're better at chases; they've had training in chases. And, um, so we start	going	over some hills down Idlewild Rd and Brian Rich loses me. Um, or I should say, both of us lost him.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Her name was Crystal. And so, um, we met in FL, and in Boca Raton and we stayed with my grandparents, and we would stay with my grandparents for at least one night, uh Boca Raton, and then the rest of the week we spent in Fort Lauderdale because my grandfather owned a hotel called The Sanddollar in a place called Lauderdale by the Sea, um, in Fort Lauderdale, and it was fantastic time and when we had the chance to spend time together and just go out on the beach and at night we would go out to dinner I remember	going	to a Benihana Japanese steakhouse, and we just felt like we had freedom, and then we weren't yet 21 so we weren't allowed to go to clubs in Fort Lauderdale, so we basically spent our time, uh, watching movies in the hotel room or just walking along the strip and I remember	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_KalbererLauren.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

So my mother use to sit back in her chair in the den and talk about how one Saturday Granny, uh, had decided she was	going	to go to town and you know back then, you're talking, oh probably 1930s, early 1930s, uh, my mother would've been 10 or 12, somewhere around there, and Granny, uh, went to the train track to get on the little trolley train, whatever they had at that time to come downtown. Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LeakJeffrey.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

To give you a little bit of brief history, I came out of the 80s like a lot of people did, kind of floundering, trying to figure out some new directions. I'd been through a lot of violent up and down swings and created peaks and valleys in my financial life and emotional life, and, course I'm sure my, my mental frame, but everything settled down and I was	going	along, had a good job, was dating a lady. Just enjoying life in general, had a wonderful relationship with my two precious daughters.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceHugh.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Both of us are quite gregarious and we talked to each other a good bit. And in the 15 to 20 minute ride to Omega Sports, as well as the 15 to 20 minute ride back from Omega Sports, we both gave each other a very good thumbnail of our lives and where we were and what was	going	on and, and the type person that we were.

Well, we played tennis the next week. The first time we played was Thursday, then we played again the next Monday, and low and behold there he was again, although he wasn't on the court right next to me, but I noticed him, and I noticed he kept looking over at our court, but I wasn't	going	to make eye contact because that was flirtatious and I was way too shy to be flirtatious. So we finished playing and I watched him walk behind our court and onto the common area and speak to someone.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Well Friday was casual day at the law firm where I worked, so I had on my nice little linen shorts and my nice little shoes and a cute little top. Well the parking lot where I worked was two and a half blocks away, so we would oftentimes wear our tennis shoes in because that's a long hike in heels or whatever, and I had walked in, in tennis shoes, my tennis shoes that I was	going	to play in that night and promptly left them under my desk downtown. So here I stand at the tennis court with this man, looking oh-so-cute dressed all in white with a little white vest, who I've never met, and we're talking like two little magpies, and I said, "We have a problem."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Ha, ha, but I know he'll say the same thing. Anyway we decided we weren't	going	to lose the match, so we settled down and we played and won and had a good time, and I thought, "Well cool.

Actually, I was just looking for another excuse to call him. So I picked up the phone about two weeks later and called him and told him that Jazz Charlotte was	going	on, nope it was called Jazz Fest, and that the company I worked for had a shuttle bus, which it did, and people signed up for it and you got to go to Jazz Fest, and it was a lot a fun and, and I said, "I don't know your status. I don't know if you're dating anybody at the time, but if you're not and you'd like to go, I would love for you to be my guest."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
But about six weeks later I get this phone call from someone asking for Chrissy Everett identifying himself as Jimmy Connors and it was, guess who? And he said there was a party, an anniversary party for some people that he worked with and did I want to go, and he was sorry that he didn't get to go to Jazz Fest with me, but he had been dating somebody and it was somebody that he used to be engaged to and then wasn't engaged to and they had reconciled, but he knew it wasn't	going	work out, but yet they were still dating when I played tennis with him but, they're not dating anymore.

So I still am fluent in French and I am very thankful for that, um, because recently, when my grandmother came to visit, she has never had heart trouble, and, um, never had anything go wrong with her heart or anything, and one day, while she was here, which was, here recently her heart rate dropped real low, so we had to, um, rush her to the emergency room, and this was something very scary for her because she doesn't speak any English. She speaks like one or two words of English, um, not to mention, she doesn't like to,	going	to the doctor, so it was like we had to hit her over the head to bring her there. But, um, we finally got her to the hospital and they, um, ended up doing surgery on her that the next day, and placing a, putting a pace maker, um, so for her, you know, to be here, you know, and get treatment under, under those circumstances was kind of scary, but she's doing better.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LuhrChantal.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

And she, oh well this, this I guess both my parents imparted to me was this, this album they that we used to have. It was, um, actually the story of Hansel and Gretel and they, I think I would like listen to it everyday because I just loved it and they would put it on the record player and, ah, I would sit in a little rocking chair that we had in our living room and listen to it, and I was kind of scared at the part where the witch was	going	to put them in the oven, but , and my dad would come in and he'd sit with me and comfort me.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ManserAlexis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So she looks around for him in the parking lot and she doesn't see him and she's worried, you know? Because he's spent, you know,	going	on minutes and minutes now. And, um, so she gets out of the car to find him and the gas station attendant runs out of the, the, um, the gas station and he tells her not to get back in her car.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ManserAlexis.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

They do a lot to help promote the uh, culture of that area of the country. I say,	going	back to some of the childhood stories in specific. Did you ever hear any stories, you know, like children's stories, not necessarily even books, but uh, maybe stories that had sort of Hispanic nature to them?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MorrisKatie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Miami, Florida was almost too much for six people in a car to be together for a 10-day period. But coming home we stopped in New Orleans and my dad had been on a roller coaster in San Francisco and he thought it was such fun and so we went to Pontchartrain Beach in New Orleans and that was nearing the end of the vacation and he said he wanted my brother Fred and me to go for the experience, he thought it was	going	to be so much fun. So we were all excited about it and got on.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MottSara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And so we got on and, as we climbed the first little hill, it just looked wonderful; we could look out over the, over the beach and wave to Mom and Dad and Gay and Annette, my sisters. And then we got to the top and my brother and I were at either end of the seat, we still were not too fond of being, of sitting together so we got up and then suddenly, in our lives began to flash in front of us we were	going	so fast. Faster than the speed of sound I know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MottSara.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And also at this theater, they gave prizes to different people. And one of the way they gave prizes was, they would take big group photos and everybody, and there were stairs	going	up to a balcony, real wide stairs. And the big group of people would go stand on the stairs and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And of course there's nothing to do with a box of ice cream sandwiches when you're at a 2-hour movie! They're	going	to melt! And another, um, that was in, that was in High Point, NC.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
-a nickel worth of scraps! And we didn't even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids	going	to the movie. And what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking, mistakes.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And when I was young, it wasn't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie. I mean, my mother knew where we were	going	and she knew when we would get back, but today you wouldn't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother; you just wouldn't do it. And we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie and we would do that.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
We just did what we could get away with. Anyway, that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre, and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls	going	somewhere to the same place it's kind of a, pretty much of a spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time. So we bought our tickets and we went into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat, file, all filed in.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And that's really all I remember about that night, it was just a lot of fun.

Been lived in Charlotte for 23 years. The story that I am	going	to tell is about my great, great, great granddaddy who was a bootlegger from Yanceyville, NC. Um, I think this story, well the story been told through my family because of, uh, what he had and what they tried to take from him.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Evidently he got smart and got out but the story goes, you know. He was	going	on and on and on and he was mixed at that, you know, he was half white and black, but they ain't really didn't too much bother him about that because of the fact his daddy was black and his momma was white, you know. They had a problem with that but, um, um, he had a lot of money, from what I understand.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He had a lot of money and then things got thick. A lot of them white people start getting jealous and start trying, you know, take the property and stuff doing little stuff,	going	out killing his chickens. They ain't mess with the his bulls or nothing.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And then one day, um, somebody got jealous, came down, and burnt down the trailer, he had a trailer on the property, then came and burned down the trailer and burnt up the chicken coop, but eventually he got all that back. Kept on bootlegging and they still getting jealous and I remember	going	to, after getting all of that back, you know, back. It's still there now, but I remember, and I still do when we, when I go to the family reunions.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
When it really got thick, when, um, it got to one point where him and sheriff fell out, and the sheriff, you know, he wasn't really, I guess, evidently, let them tell it, he was the cool guy. And the little Klan people, um, found out, you know, what the sheriff's men, or whatever, what was	going	on. And they were already jealous, a black man making money, or a half back man making money, or whatever you want to call it, and they came and burnt the house down, burnt the chicken coop down, and they killed a cow, or a couple of cows, I ain't too sure about that, but I think they killed a cow or a couple of cows.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And, um, what else? We, oh you ride pass there now, you know, like we	going	to the family reunion, you just be riding down because you got to ride. Lord, let me tell you about the ride.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
OK I go up to this oil change place, right? And, um, I say, "OK the reason," OK I'm	going	to start from the very beginning. OK.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
OK. I drove by this place	going	to work. It's down on Harris by Albemarle, right?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So I call when I get home to get their prices to compare to the University Lube where I normally get it done and it's 26 dollars for an oil change with free tire rotation, which was much cheaper than the University. So I'm like, "All right I'm	going	to go there, get my shit done, I needed a uh a tire rotation." So I go in there, only person there.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Oh yeah, oh yeah! So I pull in and he gets, he starts, "We're	going	to do the inspection first." So here he comes.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He said, "I, it's not real bad right now but if it gets worse it could. If it goes your car is	going	to just stop running." So I was like well, I'll let my dad handle that over Christmas, I'll be home `fore I know it, you know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
. I say, "Well I want you to know that I just drove 15 minutes to get here and didn't go to my normal place, where I know the people because of this huge great deal y'all have	going	on," you know? And he goes, "Oh no, no, no, no, no.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I said, "Well I hate to tell you. Not on Saturdays you ain't	going	to get your tires rotated." "What?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He said, "I normally go to this other place." And I said, "Well they're not	going	to do it." He said, "Well screw it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I said, "15 dollars." He's like, "Well I'm not	going	to leave. They've already got my car up on the thing.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I'll just pay it." He's like, "That's," you know, "I'm	going	to say something to them." He's like, "That's just screwed up."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He's like, "That's just screwed up." And, um, so anyways, were talking about it and I was telling him how he kept coming in about the blades and the fan belt and he said, "Yeah, they're out, they're	going	to do that tell them not to worry about anything." So there comes the little man.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It's almost to break, and my manager said, `do not do it, do not do it, do not do it,' so I put your tires back on and I am not	going	to rotate your tires. I am very frustrated with this lug."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He's got the lug. Yeah so he goes, "I'm	going	to break it, if I try to put back in I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And I said, "OK." He said, "I'm	going	to try. I'm just telling you, you tell your father that I did not break this it was already broken."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Ten minutes later, I mean I was there for like an hour or so. He said, oh I said, "How long is it	going	to take, because I wanted to get my book out of the car if I need to take to read." "Oh no, not long at all.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So I put it in my pocketbook. I'm like, so I'm just	going	to drive without a lug in my tire. He's like, "You have five other ones, you'll be fine.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I pull this out I said, "So when I called the other day," I said, "they told me 25.99, if you want the free tire rotation, 18.99, if you don't, you just get the oil change." I said, "First of all," I said, "I wasn't	going	to get a free oil, free tire rotation to begin with, so I shouldn't have been charged, and not even 25.99, 27.99." I said, "I shouldn't have even been charged that to begin with."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I said, "Then, he didn't get my lug nut back on," I said, "so I didn't get the tire rotation and I have a broken lug nut." I said, "And then, you're still	going	to charge me 26.99?" I said, "No way."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I said, "No way." I said, "What is	going	on here, I don't you know. I'm not happy with what's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

She was a voter. Although she was 92 or 93 at the time, she was	going	to get in her car and go vote one way or the other. And so, I would try to explain to her how it was very important, with all the growth we were experiencing in Cabarrus County, to keep the, uh, the number of kids in the classrooms to less than 30 if we could, and we weren't meeting that with the growth.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Matthew Purdie. I've been asked to recount the story of how I first came to be	going	out with my present girlfriend, who, more than likely, I will end up marrying in year and a half or so. Well the story goes something like this: Late November, early December, don't remember which, 1990, 1990 I had a dream.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And, we discussed it, and he said, "Wow!" And I said, "Jeffrey, I'm probably	going	to marry this girl." And, well, that was like nine years ago.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And we had a very, very, we went to the prom together. Then, sometime in June or July, after we graduated, we had a really long talk about what we were	going	to do because we were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Then, sometime in June or July, after we graduated, we had a really long talk about what we were	going	to do because we were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Well, low and behold, that never happened for either one of us. And we made it, all through six years of college, together, discussing quite often whether or not we were	going	to end up marrying each other. And while, she ended up taking a job in Atlanta, which was a little bit further from Charlotte than Winston-Salem was, and she wanted me to move down there.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
She thought that. But anyway, she, is probably	going	to move back here and we will probably get married, and have kids, and live the happily ever after Cinderella little story because I am Prince Charming and she is, the Princess. What other story shall I tell?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PurdieMatthew.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, and you look at other kinds of things and I think Charlotte, and maybe it's typical of the South, but I think that, uh, maybe there hasn't been as much growth here before and when you have growth and you have people coming in, who, looking for services. And you, and you also have a, a government, um, who are, are really ready to take that challenge as opposed to just deciding that, "Hey, listen we're gonna do things the way we've done it for the last, you know, 100 years, whether new people come or need services or ask for amenities or not, we're	going	to keep things the way they are." In fact, the town of Matthews, I think, um, at least my understanding is, is that when Providence Plantation, uh, reached a certain point in population they, they wanted to be annexed to the town of Matthews because they thought maybe that the city of Charlotte would annex them and so they wanted to, that they petitioned the town of Matthews to annex.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

Um, and then we went to, let's see For, I want to say it's Fort Myers Beach I think, the beach is on the West Coast, we went down, it's about an hour from my grandma's and uh, it's a really nice beach, it's uh, was pretty warm that day. I think, we all got some color, but they were having an epidemic of red tide and so all the fish were washing up on the shore and um, luck be it, since we were having such a good time um, Allison, Nancy, and I decide we are	going	to take a walk along the beach and there were fish strewn everywhere so we were careful not to step on them. However, Allison wasn't paying attention and she stepped on a fish and it got a barb, which is one of it's defense mechanisms, stuck in her foot, so it was really painful and her foot swelled up and everything.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

So she said, "Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It's always been my dream that my children all go to school. But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're	going	to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money." At that time my dad was in prison at the time, so it made it really hard for my mom.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Yes, my brother went to school. He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and	going	to school too. So he graduated from, um, Johnson C. Smith, here in Charlotte.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I think that was the last class I took. My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was	going	to school. But you would have been able to be a, a teacher if you had continued?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband. After all of this was, after I, I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of	going	back to school. I just got to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never went back.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
My name is Bonnie Rindner and I was born in San Antonio, TX, and the story I'm	going	to tell is about my mother. Um, a little background first.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RindnerBonnie.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
She is Japanese-American. She has lived in the Charlotte area for 13 years, and she is	going	to talk about growing up Japanese-American in West Virginia. Um, when I grew up in West Virginia, um, it was like it was backwards compared to the Charlotte area.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And, uh, she looked up and could see the bombs and everything. And she remembers being scared and thinking that she was	going	to die, and she said it was just one of the hardest times of her life. That, but, uh, they made it through that, and um, she really never showed any bitterness or anything towards American people, but, uh, she was always just grateful for her life.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
How did your parents meet? They met, my, my mother was	going	to Tokyo University in Tokyo and working part-time at a china factory, and my father had gone there to buy some china for his mother, and, uh, he met my mother and just fell head over heels in love. And she thought he was a crazy	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Not, um, right off. I know the story he tells about, well he's always telling about	going	to play music and how they'd play when he was young. So can you think of a story?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
He's always got a story to tell, regardless if he sees you or if it's a family gathering. He's got, you know, he's	going	to be the one that's got, the one who is keeping the crowd up, or, or, you know, just being himself. What about you?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So I think I'd probably be a little bit of him, yet a little bit of everybody else, and I'm not really one to steal the, steal the show at gatherings or what have you. If you were	going	to tell a story to your kids about your childhood, what story would you tell? It would probably all be sports related stories, um, because sports to me has been such a big factor in my life whether it teaches you the value of competition or the value of sportsmanship or the learning from mistakes of, um, in sports you are sometimes forced to make quick decisions and sometimes those decisions are not necessarily the right ones.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
The team from the northern part of our county, North Stokes and we were the southern part, South Stokes. And, uh, they had one pitcher in particular who didn't like us and he was scheduled to pitch that night and after I had been hit the third time and my best friend had been hit the second time, we kind of decided that we were	going	take it upon ourselves to hit back. Only not with baseballs but with fists, so we charged the mound.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, so, you know, things like that are learning experiences where you learn to grow up and mature. So what you	going	to tell your kid if someone from away hits them three times with a baseball? Charge the mound?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, I was decent I guess. So is that	going	to be the sport you push on our kid? I'm probably not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So is that	going	to be the sport you push on our kid? I'm probably not	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I'm probably not	going	to push any sport on our kid, my kid, although I have always said when I was in college and, right after I gave up my sports career, I always said my kid, I'm	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Especially when we first started dating and you didn't necessarily have the most reliable car of the people in NC. Your little wrecked `84 Honda Accord wasn't necessarily the thing you were	going	to drive two hours away, especially two hours to come and see me. But, um, one of the things I remember was you putting it, putting yourself getting in trouble, and really probably wasn't one of the wisest things we have ever done.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I just remember you coming up and that was one of the best times we have had. And of course one of the things I remember most was	going	out to the Farmhouse which was our first official, unofficial date. And by our first official, unofficial date, should I go into that, too?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Morgy! And, um, so we ended up	going	out but I didn't have any idea that you did have a boyfriend! But I told them to tell!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And during the summer when we were home from school, and I was five or six years old when they were both still home. She was responsible for making sure the house got clean and the chores got done and to make sure we played a part in that, and of course she was	going	to make sure we did our part. So she was the biggest slave driver I've ever seen, and my brother was always the rebel, and I, you know, as a five or six year old, I did what I could and she didn't really have a lot of trouble with me, but with my brother being, when she was 16 he was 12 so you can imagine what kind of battles they had.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, because I ended up making a lot of good friends and, um, really loving the part of town that I moved to and really adapting to, um, my community there, um, and getting involved. And actually, the friends that I made there are the ones I ended up	going	to college with and not the ones from my first high school. Right.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
They didn't like me at first `cause I was the new girl and where, you know, most of the guys, if a new girl comes in, of course they're	going	to be friendly just because it's new blood or whatever.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShieldsStacy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And one of them was that one time I wanted something on top of the bed that couldn't reach and so you said, my mom said to get, to find a way to get it, and so I don't remember what I grabbed, but I grabbed something and I climbed on top of the bed and I grabbed the thing that I wanted and I think they were like surprised because they didn't think that I would actually do it. Another one was when I think I was younger than that I was trying to climb up on a couch and my grandfather was like watching me behind me and he kept saying to everybody, "she's	going	to fall, she's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaCaroline.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
My mom told me stories. She would make up stories for us, my sister and I, at bedtime when we lived in Miami and she would tell us stories like, including like characters that were like us but we had different names and stuff, or we would be animals and they would have morals to them at the end and, or we would read books at night before	going	to bed. So this was in your bedroom?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaIvonne.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Uh, the books were always available to them. I read to them at bedtime uh, in their beds, other times they sat in my lap during the day, um, like	going	over the pictures, the sounds and the tone of voice, uh, through me, um, as to what the character was feeling, scared, happy, angry. When I felt like it um, it would be effective and my children's behavior said, "They were really into this story," at that point then I would add my own words and make up more of what had caught their interest.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SmithPatricia.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Um, my very favorite book is God on a Harley. Um, it, through that book it was me	going	through all the same experiences as the author and I saw more clearly what I needed to do.

So, um, there was, at the end of the sports season, the fall sport season and the spring sport season, at South Mecklenburg there was always, a what they called, a banquet and they didn't serve any food, but for some reason they called it a banquet. They had all the children, the students from the fall sports up on the stage to be introduced, get whatever recognition were appropriate, and, um, there was	going	to be one in early December of 1995. And, uh, that was when it was decided since I was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

So all the Quail Girls and I were together and we were having punch and cake or whatever, and the guys and Mr. Speckman were over kind of in another area. So, uh, you know, Wendy was saying, "How are we	going	to do this? How are we	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

So I called him back and we arranged to have dinner on that following Friday. So I called and talked to Michaela and I said, "Well we're	going	out to eat." And she said, "I knew it!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Ryan came up to me at school and he said, `He called her! I think they're	going	to go out! ' " And apparently another one of the Quail Girls worked at Boston Market and some of the boys who were in Ryan's group crossed the serving line and said, "He called her and he's	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

' " And apparently another one of the Quail Girls worked at Boston Market and some of the boys who were in Ryan's group crossed the serving line and said, "He called her and he's	going	to ask her out!" So everybody knew before I knew that he called me and was	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So everybody's eager to find out what's happening on this date. So, um, Michaela was	going	out and I had instructions to call her as soon as I got home, to beep her as soon as I got home so we could discuss the date. So we went out to dinner at a place where, Mr. Speckman had asked one of his sons' friends where we should go and he said that's where we should go, and so we went there to eat.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So we went out to dinner at a place where, Mr. Speckman had asked one of his sons' friends where we should go and he said that's where we should go, and so we went there to eat. And the whole evening was talk, the discussion the whole evening was how all the preparation, and all the discussion that was	going	on with me and the Quail Girls was also	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So we're talking some more, and I said, "I went and got a Christmas tree." He said, "What are you	going	to do this evening?" I said, "I'll probably put the Christmas tree up."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So Michaela came home and I said, "Guess what? I'm	going	to McAdenville." And she said, "Oh my God!"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
She called Shelle , Shelle was at the house in five minutes! "I can't believe it she's	going	out with him again! You're	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

You're	going	out with him again!" So we went out again and we went out the next Friday and Saturday and the next Friday and Saturday and the next Friday and Saturday, and meanwhile, all the kids at school are in absolute shock that we liked each other and we were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And one friend of Ryan's, Brandon said to Michaela one day, "Wouldn't it be weird if your mom and Mr. Speckman got married? And like, you moved into that house and you were taking a shower and Ryan, Ryan's your stepbrother and he's	going	to knock on the ba-, how weird would that be?" Michaela told me that and I said, "That is so weird."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
OK. My name's Carmen Stack and I'm just	going	to tell a little bit about myself. Um, I was born in Charlotte, NC and I moved to Monroe, um, which is about forty-five minutes east of Charlotte, um, when I was about three.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
She's in high school. Her name is Ivy and she's	going	to turn seventeen in a couple weeks. And my grandmother lives next door and my grandfather works across the street from where we live so, we're all really close and pretty tight and, um, I'm real, I'm closer with my grandmother, um, which is my mom's mother, and, um, we do a lot of stuff together, go shopping, and go to lunch, and stuff everyday.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And, um, when I was probably about eight years old my mom and I, um, well we had two dogs, one was a Russian Wolfhound and one was just a little mutt-dog. But, um, we left them there by themselves with, uh, well like a bowl of food out, which usually we don't do, but we were	going	to go get some lunch and, um, we were gone for probably about twenty minutes. And we came back and, Mongoose was the little one and Tanya was the bigger dog, uh, but when we came back, we saw that Mongoose, uh, was bleeding from her eyes.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
What was your favorite place? Well, we would all, well our favorite place, I mean we were pretty young, so our favorite place was like the Pavilion or	going	to walk on the strip or something.

She just always wants everything to be at her house and kind of be centered around her. So after she's gone I don't really know what we're	going	to do. It'll be kind of hard for us.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It'll be kind of hard for us. But, ah, she's 74 and she's still	going	strong but actually yesterday she had a small stroke but she's, she's OK. She's better today.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
She'll tell you like it is and if you don't like it then that's just too bad. But we've come to realize that's her and that's just the way it's	going	to have to be. But, um, um, so my next story, I guess I want to talk about, uh, I guess I'll move on to kind of high school era.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And, uh, you know, I just kind of, it was Andy's truck and he was driving. And, um, we were	going	to Lake Twitty, and I kind of just got volunteered into	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

And then, and then it was always like an adventure though because then all of a sudden, toward the end, like the parents are coming back. And we all know that if we don't have everything cleaned up you're	going	to get punished. And so it was like, "Can they do it?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Can they get cleaned up in time? Are they	going	to make it?" So it's like having a blast and	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

-which usually meant that they weren't being careful. But anyway their stories would go on and on about	going	one mile an hour up a hill taking forever to get somewhere driving getting up, a head up steam in the winter and Bucking snowdrifts is what they called it. The snowdrifts would come out into the streets into the road and, uh, this was in rural MN, so half the time you couldn't see where the road was anyway but they would go plowing these snowdrifts, you know.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And, uh, also the story of Paul, and, in particular, it's in, I think, it's in the Book of Romans, Romans 8:28 where he says, "All things work for good for those who love the Lord." Uh, and Paul, Paul's life is like a Indiana Jones movie, where, at one time, there's 40, 40 Jews, uh, Jewish scholars or whatever had taken the vow of hunger; until they caught him they weren't	going	to eat. So there's 40 guys who hadn't eaten in 30 days chasing them.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So there's 40 guys who hadn't eaten in 30 days chasing them. So you reckon at least one of them is	going	to catch them somehow but he, he managed to elude them all. And then of course he spent the rest of his life you know on shipwrecks and in jail and being beat up, and, uh, I'm sure verbally abused and just you name it.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
The freedom that we had as children is unheard of today. There was nowhere in town that you couldn't ride on a bicycle or walk, as long as you told your mother where you were	going	and you were home by dark. I wish that my children, growing up in a different age where they didn't have this kind of safety and where everybody in the town didn't look out for them, could have had this experience of this much freedom.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
They went to the same church we went to, First Methodist, and they sat on a certain pew and woe be unto the person who sat, that chose to sit on the Lann twins' pew. They watched everybody's coming and	going	when we, we kids on the street became teenagers. They could tell you who everyone was dating and, if you were a girl, whether or not you got a goodnight kiss under the porch light and probably reported it at every bridge table they sat at for the next several weeks.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
The first thing one of them asked was, "Kitty's age was not in the newspaper, how old was she?" I said, "Kitty didn't tell her age when she was alive and I just don't think we're	going	to start now." They were not even put off and did not even slow down.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
They were not even put off and did not even slow down. The next thing they wanted to know was I	going	to sell the things in mother's house and how much did I want for the mirror above the fireplace. It, I guess it was somewhat reassuring even then, that it didn't matter that they didn't express sympathy, but that some things never change and always stay the same.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
My great grandmother, who was in a big wooden wheelchair, paralyzed with arthritis, would go on this camping trip for the whole summer also. Mother and her sister spent their days playing in the woods, wading in the creek, swimming on the scuppernong vines and sometimes picking berries and	going	fishing. When the rain came my grandfather would tell Mother not to touch the tent with her finger because then the tent would leak so of course Mother would lay on her cot looking up at the tent close to her and touch it with her finger a slow drip would come and Mother would be in trouble but not as much trouble as when she was playing on the muddy creek bank and lost her shoe the only pair she had.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasKay.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Growing up, almost everybody went to church and students went with them and it sure didn't make them perfect, but it seem to uh, place some fear in their minds, some people today I think have no fear, even fear of death. They think they're	going	to come back, it's some temporary vacation and they don't realize when they use violence or they when they overdose how permanent it is. So if we don't, people have different tendency of churches and religions, Judaism, Hinduism, ( ), Christianity and then you have Atheist.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It's the home of West Virginia Wesleyan College and that was my playground, that was my own, the place where I spent so much of my childhood playtime and, uh, running through the different buildings and structures of the campus.

And, and everybody knew me so nobody really tried uh, to uh corral me, so I was sort of free to go and do what I wanted, you know when the buildings were open.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Someplace like that, that is more south. But, I enjoy WV and I enjoy	going	back and meeting friends and uh, stirring up memories.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
But uh, with my last two interviews, but I digress, anyway. ( ) Dad, Dad, um, do you remember	going	to Audra State Park a lot when you were a younger teenager, and if so, what kinds of things would you do there, including snake hunting, drinking of alcohol, etc? Jess, I never hunted snakes because I don't like snakes.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLarry.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

As a child I loved it, but as I grew up there just really wasn't a whole lot that Buckhannon had to offer other than the fact that, you know, was where my memories of childhood are and my parents.

They left out of NY and went to Scotland.

I wanted to be a ballerina. The ballerina part never came about, but I, I did go on to college and I, um, transferred a lot and ended up	going	to a lot of different colleges which was kind of fun. I went to Marshall University, and I went to University of Pittsburgh, and I ended up graduating from West Virginia University with a major in printmaking and a minor in art history and English literature.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Especially the anti-religious art. Um-hmm, well art has always been controversial and has always reflected what is	going	on in the world. You know, and, um, so, you know, having studied art history, that doesn't, it doesn't shock me or surprise me that much.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And I, you know, I don't like it, personally, because, you know, it does offend me, what, what I have seen, and I don't like the idea that we are giving the money to create extremely offensive art, but, um, again, that, that's, you know, is, art reflects what's	going	on and art is, is very spiritual regardless of whether its content says, you know, something about God or not, there, there has a very spiritual quality about it. It's very powerful	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I've always been interested. It's a, it was a good way to find out what was	going	on outside the world that I was living in. So do you remember any particular ones that you really liked, or anyone?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WerthChristopher.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So maybe, you know, it was just, you know, you know, when I would physically see her for a while, it was like once a year. But there was never any storytelling	going	on. Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WerthChristopher.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And she started, started pulling me or something, I don't remember exactly, so the dogs circled her and snarled and growled at her and she got, backed back into the house. And I wouldn't come in because I knew I was	going	to get a whipping for climbing up in that tree. And later, I guess I forgot and she knew I would.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

Yep. She's probably	going	to be my best teacher. She is?	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteJustin.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So, she kept trying and got pregnant with me, and carried me to full term and so, since she was, and my dad were both much older, I was a terribly spoiled brat. Because I was their only child and they knew I was	going	to be their only child and, within reason, I got just about anything I wanted that they could afford, I got. Oh wow!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
But when I was, I think one of my earliest recollections, was when I was three years old, Mama and Daddy and I went down to, to FL. And I remember,	going	through the lobby of the hotel where we stayed at with my bathing suit on and with one of those God-awful swim caps that everybody that you see when you look in the 40s movies and it felt like I was in a vacuum when I was walking! I could hear my feet in my ears!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
But it still got wet. But that's one of the memories I have of walking across the lobby of the hotel and	going	clunk, clunk, clunk as I was walking across and then	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And my mother would say to me, "Frances Jeanette! If you get any darker, they're	going	to make you sit in the back of the bus!" Oh my gosh!	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So, um, we lived on Fort Bragg Rd, which, at that point, was the only road between Fayetteville and Fort Bragg. And with all the added construction and all that, from six in the morning until nine, it was bumper-to-bumper traffic on this little two-lane road	going	to Fort Bragg. Wow.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And I remember all the headlights on all the cars were painted black for the first half, the first, the top semi-circle was black so that when if you went out at night, the light would shine just down on the road and not straight ahead. Everybody had window shades, you didn't have blinds back then, but everybody had window shades that were blackout shades and you had to pull them down at night before you turned on any of the lights, because everyone was deathly afraid that the Germans or the Japanese were	going	to come bomb us. Not that they ever did or--	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
\\ \\ --I don't think \\ they ever planned on it, but everyone was quite sure that that was	going	to happen. Looking back it almost seems silly.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And she'd put me up on the piano bench and would know for at least 30 or 45 minutes exactly where I was because I was sitting there playing the piano. So when I was four, all my little friends were	going	take, ballet and tap dance lessons and I wanted to, but they encouraged me to play take piano lessons because the piano teacher lived right around the corner and the dance teacher was all the way on the other side of town, where her dance studio was.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
She always kept him in the backyard, so I never went in the backyard. I'd always go in the front door there instead of	going	around to the back. I hadn't thought about that until just now, for a long time.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Oh, I bet. And then coming back, we came back through Roanoke, VA and then were on the Skyline Drive, and Daddy said, "We're	going	to go to Roanoke and there's Roanoke Mountain there." Or Roan Mountain, anyway, there's supposed to be a mountain right in the middle of Roanoke.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
Or Roan Mountain, anyway, there's supposed to be a mountain right in the middle of Roanoke. So I was thinking, having looked at all my books, school books, that it was	going	to be like the Rockies. --with snow and, you know, crags, a, and rocks and all that sort of thing.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
On the left was a living room with a fireplace. On the right was a dining room and there were stairs	going	upstairs between that. And behind the dining room was a little, small room that they called a breakfast room, which was just because they had a wall between that and the kitchen.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And, well, each, each of the bedrooms had the separate stove and refrigerator and they shared a bath. And we would rent them to couples who were just	going	to be there while their husbands were	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
It was! It was necessary because the guys were	going	off to war and the, their wives didn't know when or if they would ever see them again. Uh-huh.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
She came down and stayed usually a couple of months, all summer. And she and Leola, Leola brought her over to see Daddy for a condolence call, and sparks flew and they started	going	out and that's when they decided to get married and she became my stepmom. Wow.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
And I mean it was scandalous! So she had a lot of talk	going	on about her when she married Daddy and came down to Fayetteville. And, um, cried a lot about it because some people were very spiteful to her.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So yeah, I learned how to drive at a very early age and needless to say my first car was a straight drive and no one, um, in that town really waited until they were 15 or 16 to drive. We all were driving pretty early because who's	going	to know about that far out that we didn't have a license so here's related, um, to driving. Another thing, uh, that I learned to, how to do very early on was drive a tractor.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
I don't want to have anything more to do with the tractor." Well my dad said, "Get back on it your	going	driving." So he made me get back on it because he wanted to teach me that we make mistakes and that you just have to get back on kind a like if you fall off a horse so that's my stories that I remember about driving.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So he made me get back on it because he wanted to teach me that we make mistakes and that you just have to get back on kind a like if you fall off a horse so that's my stories that I remember about driving. OK	going	back to the whole goat thing, I'll tell you another story about the goats. Uh the fence, um, we had this goat that we bottle fed, actually we bought, our dad bought the goat.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
So he was quite rambunctious, so he used to always tell us stories about things he did as a kid. First of all, even though he was capable of, uh,	going	to school and doing his schoolwork, he chose not to and he would always, um, what you call play hooky, and on those days when we wouldn't go to school he would always come up with some kind of tricks, and one of the things I remember him saying that he did and actually since the time this time I had other people confirm that, uh, this is true that he would take a pocketbook, one of his mom's pocketbooks, and empty it out and tie it a string to the handle and he'd put it in the middle of the road and he and his buddy would let the string be long enough to where they could hide in the bushes and still have the string attached and then they'd wait for a car to drive by and there would always be a car to come by because, of course, this was in the country. And a car comes by and sees see a pock	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

Well you would think they'll just jerk it away and laugh. Well they decided that that wasn't fun enough so they would jerk it a little bit and make it seem like it was the wind, or just do it a little bit where they weren't, maybe the person wasn't quite sure if it really moved or not, or that maybe they accidentally kicked it and they'd do that a couple a times and then they would have basically be teasing the person along until the person just had thought they were	going	crazy.

He made a D in PE, a D in, um, gym. Yeah he, he wasn't quite fond of school and he dropped out in May of his senior year, so although he later in life became successful and owned his own company, he just didn't, and I guess, and neither did his parents think school was that important so his, his stories they always told us didn't involve growing up and	going	to school and doing well and behaving they were always mischievous.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WynnTammi.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum oh yeah yeah yeah because you'd be strongly into denial it's just like well we know you take it we've got the positive test results and you're	going	i don't i don't right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2096-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

when i when i started thinking about this that those are some of my favorite shows McGyver because it's it's only one person there more than uh you know instead of a cast of people but he's always	going	out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and you know pieces of baling wire and uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2102-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
some of the little things yeah and uh i just decided i had to do that i think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it i mean i could just sit mindlessly in front of a TV set for hours and i just realized i was sort of like an alcoholic if i didn't get the booze out of the house i was	going	to drink uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2102-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

i wonder how truthful all of that was or whether that was fictional yeah i i i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the FBI uh	going	i guess yeah well they keep it rather secretive yes	#telephone#	telephone_sw2109-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah yeah yeah well because that's the way they they might seem outwardly but boy there's a lots	going	on in there that's right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2109-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
because actually when you when you do uh service overseas you end up learning something usually that's that's really useful plumbing or farming or or something like that so you're really learning a skill yeah and you know all these old people they would get out of this right all the ones that are already retired so what could we could do is take all the retired people that are	going	around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country i'm just teasing	#telephone#	telephone_sw2110-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and that's real discouraging thinking you're sitting there working to separate it and then they and someone else isn't	going	to take the time to put it in two separate bags right right so they're they're really trying to start keeping an eye out for those you know talking to the people again about	#telephone#	telephone_sw2111-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

okay i didn't think he was	going	to do very good because i thought he was a college football coach and not a professional coach yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah okay yeah i think a lot of people had that impression that uh that he ought he should have stayed in the college ranks but uh looks like they're	going	to do all right yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah so i don't know if he's	going	to be in shape to and course they were they were kind of like the Cowboys in that after Lombardi who could fill his shoes	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and it it was it was good to see a good good uh championship game i think Buffalo is an up an coming team they're	going	to they're showing some real promise for the next uh few years yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and not many people can afford to spend a hundred dollars on the weekend yeah i think the owners have somewhat lost sight on that because uh they are all wealthy people and uh the expect that uh the average Joe is	going	to be able to to go to a game and uh pay for that type of entertainment yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah and uh i don't think that's	going	to die very quickly he is getting some support there were a lot of people that are uh that were skeptical and the Cowboys are coming back and they have a pretty good team Troy Aikman looks like to be looks like he's got the star qualities for a quarterback hum yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah if they'll just give him some protection and don't kill him before h e yeah well i was surprised at the the way they drafted last year they didn't really didn't go for the uh big offensive lineman or the defensive lineman they're	going	for the skilled positions so quarterbacks they really yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
wins uh in the long run you can have the best half back there is or the best quarterback but if they don't have any blocking maybe they can't do anything yeah they've got an awful lot of good draft picks coming up it's	going	to be interesting to see what they do with them yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah and uh the other teams in the NFC East uh they're they're getting uh older uh they're	going	to have to like the Washington Redskins uh that that's an older team and they're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

were not able to get on the NFL because the NFL's teams were just full right well some people i'm sure the the more talented people in that league are	going	to try to uh impress NFL scouts with their play in that league yeah but yeah and wind up in the NFL	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah but yeah and wind up in the NFL possibly but that's that's uh one in a million shot if they have the talent to be in the NFL they're	going	to get drafted and make a pro team there aren't	#telephone#	telephone_sw2116-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

as we said well nothing's happening in the war because now they're interviewing the what seems to be dozens of Mideast experts all at once right oh they've really done uh good job of keeping everybody informed of what's	going	on sometimes i've wondered if it wasn't almost more than we needed to know hm	#telephone#	telephone_sw2118-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

they pay for school a little bit otherwise i would never yeah most kids is probably just	going	to have to do what i did be comfortable again	#telephone#	telephone_sw2233-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah but uh that's how i got my my education such as it was was	going	into it is service and then coming back coming out in three years and	#telephone#	telephone_sw2233-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and um that makes you feel bad right and you know when um when last year the the elections were	going	on the governors election and state and you know i i didn't have anything against um Clayton Williams personally or anything but um it was kind of hard for me to think here's someone who as wealthy as he is didn't have to pay any income tax that he said that year he claimed he had didn't have to pay income tax and he thought well you know there's some people	#telephone#	telephone_sw2234-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i'm i'm willing to pay for that for my children and i'm willing to sacrifice i guess i mean i'm not	going	to be the kind of person that's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2234-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but isn't it part of our income it's not part of our taxes no you know that's why the price price of mailing a letter keeps	going	up it's not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2235-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
it's not that's why it keeps	going	up huh that's another topic you know i could	#telephone#	telephone_sw2235-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that's funny yeah and that is a good short term thing though that little things like that that overall though i just think we're just	going	to i don't know see i know i guess i'm kind of leery of this topic because i know that Bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations but i see that to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2235-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i know that Bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations but i see that to be a potential power problem later with um who's	going	to be in charge with this new world order and i you know i'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place but i know we already have a new money system we already have new bills printed for the US Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency and i mean i've seen them	#telephone#	telephone_sw2235-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and so i know that the long-term vision for the US government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh but i'm concerned with whose	going	to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know that's a lot of power for one or two people to have	#telephone#	telephone_sw2235-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
because there's no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back and it might not be money it might be um no taxes on our things our computers	going	into their nation it might come back in another way but it would be come back bu t because we're loaning it i think that's the problem and i don't mean give it to everybody that asks use a lot of discernment don't give money to every nation	#telephone#	telephone_sw2235-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money and so i just think we're never	going	to get that back you know do you understand	#telephone#	telephone_sw2235-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and uh he's kind of unhappy i've got it now but i'm not	going	to give it back yeah that's probably the way it goes sometimes	#telephone#	telephone_sw2236-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

more esoteric yeah what's	going	on and what needs to be done but i really do think that the population that people are pretty well aware i think more so now than ever before you know i think that's true and i i tend to think that our children are also growing up with a bit more awareness of that at least i mean i i feel i try to as an individual my children are very young but	#telephone#	telephone_sw2239-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
do you have any uh any thoughts on whether painting's a good idea or a bad idea well well of course uh it depends i guess on what you're uh oh oh what you're you're interest and abilities are so far as whether you're	going	to paint yourself uh i've painted uh like i said both interior and exterior myself uh not a lot of exterior but uh i've painted you know rooms and ceilings inside and	#telephone#	telephone_sw2240-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

but i i haven't really found it too bad we've lived in our house about uh oh thirteen years i suppose and and really really only painted once and you know it was new when we bought it and we painted one time since then but you know it's probably	going	to be time to paint again in a couple of years	#telephone#	telephone_sw2240-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

in well i think i think my long-term sense of of budget concerns is that we're	going	is a lot of others government's spending goes on goes towards this uh health care and things like that and a lot of causes of poor health or need for health care are	#telephone#	telephone_sw2246-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
somehow we still i guess believed that the countries that we were helping were were eventually	going	to pay us back and that hasn't happened	#telephone#	telephone_sw2246-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so it's a sort of like this is uh i see a i don't know there's if there's a metaphor	going	on who are we loaning the money to and people can disagree about who that money is being loaned to yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2246-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah yeah in some in some cases it uh i think it's actually	going	to you know the people that it's intended for in other cases uh and and this is all based and this is all up to actually the government that's in control now in some cases the the money actually does filter down to the to where it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2246-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

they should last a while well let us hope that everybody's	going	to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because i believe we are i i do believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening	#telephone#	telephone_sw2249-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i think they will as long as they can but the problem obviously is the cost of health care as you know it's just	going	completely out of sight right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
it is very much so it's a billion dollar problem you know every year uh our company had it doesn't apply to me thank goodness it applies to you know to the younger employees that they're having to pick up you know more of the uh health insurance cost you know themselves the deductibles are	going	up and the co-payments are	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage uh-huh i guess it also depends on how many how many times you're	going	to use it now we	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and if you yeah if you want to so at least you you know you wouldn't have any surprises you can order any type of you know service you want but you stand a good chance you know having to pick up at least part of the bill yourself um-hum so the so i guess that if when i get a job and i and i look into the health insurance that they're	going	to pay for then i should really look really really deep into the policy um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum but i would really check that out because i'm concerned in coming years it's	going	to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger folks what i'm really scared about and you know i'm i don't know firsthand but i it seems to me that like you were saying earlier that the deductibles are getting bigger and bigger	#telephone#	telephone_sw2250-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that uh they should vote it one way or the other so maybe it is worth having that extra little or	going	to the the very	#telephone#	telephone_sw2251-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know we're we're ashamed we're not	going	to do that anymore and uh yeah exactly	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do on it have have not been world powers so it's easier for us to say you know to an Iraq you know uh you can't do this get back you know or we're	going	to force you whereas you know if the Soviet Union would've i don't know	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum but i don't believe that he in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is	going	to be allowed to get away with it either yeah well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward you know just some some pretty hard by the socialism and uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2252-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum and uh i'm still trying to decide when when the best time's	going	to be to do that so uh yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2258-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well you know you'd think that this crazy system if you're	going	to talk about something about the weather they'd have tried to plug you in with plug you in to somebody split it up a little bit	#telephone#	telephone_sw2258-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um the hospital stuff that the the government gives money to um the you know all the things that the government does like that i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better but i don't think uh anybody is just	going	to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks because they've been messing it up for many years now so yeah well i have to agree that and and you're right i mean we you know we do have a good government we do have a lot of things	#telephone#	telephone_sw2260-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that's right my parents uh bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other Wednesday and that's exactly right even though the note is thirty years she said it's	going	be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that oh yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2260-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right right and that's	going	on the principle it doesn't pay any interest or usually usually it doesn't anyway yeah so that's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2260-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum right that's what we're looking at fifteen or maybe twenty we're not	going	to go longer than twenty yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2260-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah but we're taking our time we're	going	uh try to make our decision by July well that's good though	#telephone#	telephone_sw2260-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well that's good though so and we just started two or three weeks ago and we're not	going	to just kill ourselves you know just two or three houses a week at the most yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2260-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh okay which has made us as lot more stable but anyway well it was nice to talk to you they're are	going	to interrupt us any minute now i can tell well that's good	#telephone#	telephone_sw2260-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
as long as you got congressmen and senators that are getting kickbacks kickbacks from these different companies that are getting awarded for the defense contracts that's never	going	to happen i know that's well maybe that's what i'm saying as long as greed and corruption is in there how do we get away from that though	#telephone#	telephone_sw2261-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
at least we're in agreement on that aren't we i'm afraid i have no other thoughts on fixes and i'm not really sure that they would accept our suggestions anyhow i think eventually it's	going	get to the point where there's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2261-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum it's	going	to come to a point where the average American citizens say we've had enough how do they react then	#telephone#	telephone_sw2261-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
waste products before they turn to incineration because we feel that uh the small percentage that they're	going	to be putting into the air is too much you know the uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2262-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
it's just so bad that there is just so much	going	into the air and and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there and everywhere it all adds up huh-uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2262-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
huh-uh you just thought well it's obvious that there's a lot	going	up in the air there and what comes up must come down yeah yeah breathing it we're breathing it all the time	#telephone#	telephone_sw2262-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
they're making fantastic amounts on these things and uh even the incinerator the money and the income that they're	going	to make off this is you know just astronomical	#telephone#	telephone_sw2262-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
seems kind of old to me no you're young you have a lot of life yet and these we have some people who say well this isn't	going	to affect me this air pollution huh-uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2262-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum that it's and they don't realize these things are	going	to affect everybody and if you're older it's not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2262-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yes uh everybody is	going	to be affected by it that's really true and we all you know need to be willing to help pay a little bit like i've heard some people uh grumble about their uh cars passing their emission tests and things and	#telephone#	telephone_sw2262-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
then they put it in the dump some place and they find out well this dump doesn't work so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else We end up paying for it again now we're	going	to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators and we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted huh-uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2262-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

that's right that's right so	going	out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because it you know there was so much else to do right right well do you live like along uh Houston	#telephone#	telephone_sw2268-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah uh this is	going	to be i've seen a lot of video lot of lot of video VCR stuff um yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2270-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right and uh so you if you knew what was	going	on you could kind of anticipate what was	#telephone#	telephone_sw2270-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you know it was cold in the theater and it's wet in the movie and they kind of just it was it was comfortable it was easy to go in you didn't have to think a lot and and uh and there is nothing worse than	going	to see a movie where you have to follow a hidden plot yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2270-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum but i can see a lot of benefits in that it might uh interest some people that had never thought of maybe	going	into social work or right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2272-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum that's true well i was thinking too um we usually think of the Peace Corps as	going	overseas to do something but if they required this where you stay in the US and you know benefit the people here and perhaps too the fact that we have more elderly people now	#telephone#	telephone_sw2272-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

okay Jim um can you tell me a little bit about your opinions on capital punishment uh the bottom line that i after four years of working with the state prison system i've come to the conclusion if you're	going	to give the man the death sentence go ahead and fulfill the sentence understandably the Supreme Court says any time you hand down a death sentence to somebody they get a one appeal once that appeal fails within thirty days execute sentence	#telephone#	telephone_sw2294-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
go ahead and fulfill the sentence understandably the Supreme Court says any time you hand down a death sentence to somebody they get a one appeal once that appeal fails within thirty days execute sentence if you're	going	to give the man the death sentence don't keep the guy on death row for eight nine ten years and make him worry about it yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2294-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
now um what do you think about about the death penalty itself do you think that we should have a death penalty absolutely and i wish they would exercise it more thoroughly let the punishment fit the crime in this state we've got a very weird situation	going	on we're under federal supervision and i agree to a point i agree with how the system works in some respects in other ways i don't for first time offenders everybody's entitled to screw up once we'll give them the early release credits we'll give them the good time credits we'll give them the early parole	#telephone#	telephone_sw2294-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but yet you get some of the jury trials and and it comes down to the nitty gritty when people are ready to condemn a person they always kind of forgive him a little bit nobody wants to put the finger on somebody and say well that's it you know we're	going	to kill you so it's got to be up to the judges i think we need we have to put into place judges that are stricter than the ones that are in there now	#telephone#	telephone_sw2294-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

right and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing but the way our system our court system works that guy's	going	to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2302-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah um i i suspect the apathy is is due to something like people just feeling that that their vote doesn't count anyway i mean why why bother voting if um if your vote won't make a difference so for instance in um the last presidential election i'm sure a lot of people thought oh Bush is	going	to win either way why bother voting why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter that's right i think that's and and the other side of the coin is um people saying well if i really like the underdog candidate i still think they're not	going	to win so some are saying Dukakis is certainly not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i think on the local elections it's actually um i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because they feel like well you know the country's real important and you know if i elect if we help elect a president who's	going	to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know um and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
they feel like well you know the country's real important and you know if i elect if we help elect a president who's	going	to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know um and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
tend not to be registered and they don't register and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you	going	to vote today they say well i would um	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah that that's possible i still think that that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference though as well i think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i'm just a little nobody my vote's not	going	to count anyway you know and i think that's probably a portion of the population that's massively under represented i i i would guess	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and their vote didn't count that's right but but it's the thought they all got out but you wonder if you know if if now the next election they have if only half of them are actually	going	to show up or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in Russia or any one shows up	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that's probably true yeah yeah i think well i know it's true you see a lot of that you know rally behind the female she may lose but by golly we're	going	to make a statement here yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2303-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

well actually i think it's good i i i hope that we uh uh get a chance to uh promote peace out there uh because i think without peace we're not	going	to get uh stable oil prices and and uh i'd i'd really like to see stability in in that area because i'm always afraid that's where uh another big war is	#telephone#	telephone_sw2342-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah well yeah that's probably true i i suspect that if any world war is come at this point in time they're	going	to come from there uh i would think anyway i mean it just seems to me that that's that's the most unstable part of the world as far as i can tell	#telephone#	telephone_sw2342-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh i would think anyway i mean it just seems to me that that's that's the most unstable part of the world as far as i can tell i saw um just recently where uh uh the US is supposedly	going	to be uh putting pressure on all the you know the Israelis supposedly to to come to a bargaining table to uh actually i heard that the Israelis were even talking at least mentioned about giving up some of the Golan Heights	#telephone#	telephone_sw2342-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and uh you know in some sense may the moderates may be right they may you know may be it is better if they give up just a little bit just to sort of settle things down well uh i guess it's one of those things that uh if it's	going	to really promote a lasting peace if there is not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2342-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so i don't i don't know how to i don't i don't know what to do about it but um but i think that that you know in general the region is really in bad shape do you think the US is	going	to wind up keeping uh military bases over there um probably oh isn't isn't there a plan now to make a command center there or something	#telephone#	telephone_sw2342-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

actually i feel kind of sorry for them right now because the people are are are uh wanting things that we have that they're not allowed i mean just some basic freedoms and and their government is not allowing it and Gorbachev seems to be	going	back on some of the things that he's been trying to push yeah actually i noticed that i mean this this this most recent scam of his where he said	#telephone#	telephone_sw2344-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

i don't know i mean and it it might be something that he wouldn't be able to control that's that that's that's something that really true that may sort of that military thing i was speaking of before i think that's that's certainly true i mean his military may just go out and say well we just Gorbachev said you can't do it and we're just not	going	to let you do it you know so um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2344-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum you don't find that much in small companies because you can kind of interface but when you get a big company like ours i think it's great that they take the time to you know give us a monthly meeting to tell us what's	going	on right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2361-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

oh really yeah i uh thought i wanted to be a teacher so but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was	going	to like it um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels or yeah it was i just took grades one through six i thought i was	going	to be smart and get the good kids wrong um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right i don't know back when i was	going	to school uh you just didn't get away with things these kids get away with now um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum and you don't know if you were reaching them or not but we felt like you know maybe just	going	ahead and try to teaching them was better trying to teach them was better than have them taken out yeah because uh that just that doesn't do a lot for them i mean it alleviates your problem but it doesn't do anything for them	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum and then at the end of the of a certain time period you spitted everything back out and the better uh memorizer you are the better your grades	going	to be yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah is that what you ended up	going	into um yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
maybe on smaller smaller scales well i don't know i uh as much as i didn't like school when i was	going	through it from my perspective now i can see that it's a lot better	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum to students because they're	going	get they're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum you know somebody okay we're	going	to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day and he's out of our hair right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh yeah it has to be reinforced in the home oh sure i mean mean you you can you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get anything anything at home then it's it's not	going	to help either yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2362-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
what is that what is it because of because of expense is that the uh costs are just	going	out of sight and and uh you know it's either increase the premiums or try to uh everybody work together to try to curtail the cost that's the way i see it	#telephone#	telephone_sw2363-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
huh the logical thing would have been had to go had it go to the the employee number so that's the one you're	going	to do the next action on the change you know and there's a lot of little things like that in there	#telephone#	telephone_sw2363-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum don't know what y'all are	going	through to be honest with you to sit there in option one and approve everybody's time i didn't do it before and i don't do it now so i don't have anything to compare that with for us in communicating with people with everybody um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2363-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yes i do uh there seems to be a a more a mature crowd in uh apartments at least where i am uh even though you know there's kids all around and there's there's traffic and there's people	going	up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that but still uh everybody pretty much keep keeps keeps to their own turf so to speak	#telephone#	telephone_sw2368-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
everybody pretty much keep keeps keeps to their own turf so to speak yeah pretty much and uh there's never really any any oh i remember in school there's just seem like there was a fight or a party or something	going	on every night you don't run into that up here i think i think because there's so many uh professional people if you want to call them that yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2368-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

uh two years ago my children started asking they say picture of it over at Texans and we started	going	there again we sort of rediscovered it well that that's true i've never thought i've heard about it countless times but never thought about	#telephone#	telephone_sw2369-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

uh well i had only had the boat two years now uh most of the time we either go out to Lavon or uh we have been	going	up to Arkansas uh she her parents live up on Beaver Lake in northwest Arkansas real good it's uh uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2369-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so well you're you're you're you you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose i suppose i do because i've seen a lot of those changes the the changes that women have had in the last generation well you know not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years	going	from well uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh take it back thirty years i'm	going	back too far from my parents' generation when mom stayed home yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and uh we'll see how the generations go huh but uh a really good day care is probably	going	to cost more than you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
also with uh with work for like three months and and so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer you know the technicians work the eight to five job and and know when they're	going	to be there yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah but uh if you're	going	to be more professional professional oriented then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah and so it was in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once um-hum so you figure one of these days you're	going	to go back to being an engineer is that what you think well actually i've found out that i'm not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum so you figure one of these days you're	going	to go back to being an engineer is that what you think well actually i've found out that i'm not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and i need it for the break so yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and	going	out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah yeah i think that's the thing that were	going	to see well i think the biggest thing we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i think that's the thing that were	going	to see well i think the biggest thing we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah so jobs have to i guess become more flexible i think they're really	going	to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah it's	going	to have to be both well so so that's another thing that has to adapt is you know the the the father's attitudes about you know whose whose job is this	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and uh and i think that's that's	going	to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls it's not they're not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah needed to be done they're	going	to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be cleaned um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah that's the thing if woman's role like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too and a lot of it's for the better some of the some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things	going	back to work and i want	#telephone#	telephone_sw2370-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um in fact last year i was driving home one night and i was listening to some station some radio station in Iowa and uh the uh DJ was saying uh tonight's	going	to be like eighty below gosh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2371-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and there's three of us EDP auditors and one of the three of us has an accounting background and so she's not real proficient in PCs and the other just hasn't used PCs that much so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing and i'm the administrator for our local area network and i need to keep that	going	and uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2372-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and uh but boy those Lebanese in in Jordan they were saying you know this whole war is Israel's fault because Israel told the United States to attack Iran it was all you know like like Israel controls our government i know and isn't that amazing the way that they'll find their cause and and and no matter what situation they see they're	going	to find their cause whether it's truly exists or not uh you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw2452-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

well i think it during this in this evolutionary theory that i have here that men will eventually evolve around to where they participate more in the home because when it gets to the point to where that the house is dirty and the kids are dirty and and mom's not home she's at work men are	going	to gradually learn how to do those kinds of things yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2453-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

uh-huh think that's	going	to happen in the next twenty years but uh you know i think that there's progress and i'm not very political so i don't really know you know any i don't know any statistics on you know how many women run for public office and how often they're defeated	#telephone#	telephone_sw2453-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i don't know any statistics either but it's it's probably	going	to be the same type of situation that that uh the black people have gone through it took them well black men long time to to get up to the pay scales of the white man and now i think it it's feasible for a black man to be president	#telephone#	telephone_sw2453-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

but uh eventually you know the the tax money is getting extremely low on the FSLIC i mean they're in they're getting they're getting so low it it's almost in trouble and and where's where's that	going	to come from and the	#telephone#	telephone_sw2454-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah that's true that's true that's what scares me when you get into that type of situation you know if you are	going	to change it watch out for the person that's changing it they may put another loophole in that um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2454-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
wasn't even there to begin with yeah and and and people like us never hear about about what's really	going	on and what they what they're really doing and i think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of time because they're there to sell newspapers that's the problem with the news both the on television and the paper	#telephone#	telephone_sw2454-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

hum yeah oh yeah i i definitely do in fact i've got family that still lives up there um from what i hear from everybody up there they're not	going	to have a good year because they let too many people go but i've been following Spring training and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far so well is that a good indicator	#telephone#	telephone_sw2460-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
what they were you know what they were looking for in other words if if in Spring crain training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do um then it really doesn't give you any indication but if they were uh playing the people that they're	going	to play then that might be pretty good indication so you know it's it's it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just you know come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring craning training and then gone on a you know fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season so	#telephone#	telephone_sw2460-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that have the talent to do the best years and um that they hadn't had these uh gigantic uh career years yet and and just kind of assume that you know someone one of them is	going	to break through eventually so and i i think they said the Reds um this last year i'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2460-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

uh that's a good question i the Rangers have a have a pitching problem and whether or not they can fix that or not is	going	to be an interesting question they're doing the right thing though uh they are	#telephone#	telephone_sw2460-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well and that i think that's maybe part of it that that the um and it you know if i owned the team i think you'd like them to do well but the question of losing big big money that what didn't didn't did Steinbrenner actually make money on the uh you got me i you know i think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are	going	to be to the point where the average fan can't go and once you do that you lose everything i mean well it it it yeah it's it's a little bit like any other sport you know when it starts costing you fifty to a hundred dollars to go to a game	#telephone#	telephone_sw2460-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum the other thing too is that the oak trees have those acorns and i don't know if i'm uh	going	to have to go out there and if i can rake those up or if i'm	#telephone#	telephone_sw2556-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

uh well we're we're	going	to pay for that that whether we pay industry or pay we we've already paid industry for like these super fund that's cleaning up we paid industry for it yeah that's true	#telephone#	telephone_sw2557-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well i think that in the in the cases that like that uh they had to be uh pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of	going	to war it was uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2558-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well that makes sense and then you run into again to um the bureaucracy in running it you know how you	going	to cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then oh yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2558-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh yeah yeah i'm sorry i'm	going	to have to go but my other line is blinking but it was good to talk to you but	#telephone#	telephone_sw2558-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah yeah It was in the it was in the summer at at at at the time but you think they would pay more attention to what was	going	on that they'd see this guy had taken off his clothes that's crazy but i think they're under stress i mean i can't imagine working in a nursing home like that either because it must be so depressing	#telephone#	telephone_sw2561-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well actually my father's parents both of them sort of you know they just died of something um but the my grandmother my grandmother's case which is very sad she fell she came into New York to visit and she fell at the airport	going	down some steps and spent you know six months in the hospital but it is was still it it was it wasn't yeah so yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2561-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

but that's because i'm allergic to the grass oh that'd be awful i love	going	out in the Summer in the grass really now i like to go to the beach where the sand is because then it doesn't make me ill	#telephone#	telephone_sw2562-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

crime in the cities and i guess in some of the rural areas too seems to be	going	up i don't know it'll ever go down on any steady basis uh more people more opportunities and somewhat of a lessened uh sensitivity toward it it's almost um	#telephone#	telephone_sw2563-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
somewhat of a lessened uh sensitivity toward it it's almost um you know it's almost expected that that's	going	to occur and there's not quite the shock any more especially the so-called littler things where people tend to steal a little time at work or steal a few supplies or	#telephone#	telephone_sw2563-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i'd agree with that uh i guess that's not	going	to do anything but spread as as uh economic hardships spread and so will the the crimes of that age group i guess i've got a a brother-in-law that's on the police force and and his uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2563-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

it may be up to the the work place to help try to control it because it doesn't seem like any where else uh you know we're getting that assistance because in schools you know i i would hate to have a child young child right now because i think this is	going	to be a tough tough period for young kids with uh you know the drugs as rampant as they are uh-huh well i've got an eleven year old son and an eight year old daughter and my son says i don't understand this drug stuff why don't people understand all you have to do is say no	#telephone#	telephone_sw2564-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

well see i don't really see the need of it you know how many elementary school teachers do you think are	going	to be on drugs right uh i guess the only the only concern i'd have	#telephone#	telephone_sw2564-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
somewhere else right especially since we're	going	to cut you know i guess the only fear i would have would be that uh you know if i had a child uh that one in a million first grade teachers that would be on drugs my child would be in their class you know and and	#telephone#	telephone_sw2564-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah and what to do when they're faced with it right but i just think of her you know next year she's	going	to be five six years old in kindergarten in same school with you know uh i guess ten year olds isn't that six sixth sixth grade you know and that's a big gap	#telephone#	telephone_sw2566-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

i tend to agree on that very strongly sexual crimes unless there's a true change of character and that's where we just have to to trust the authorities and they're not	going	to excuse people if it was was run like that i don't there would probably be very few exceptions to that and if it was done quickly and done swiftly and but it's not because the judicial system has rejected they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much	#telephone#	telephone_sw2571-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but i know that they have like uh their crime rate it's not Jamaica i don't think i can't remember which it's uh one of the Caribbean Islands and and they Singapore is it like that my husband's	going	Singapore and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law and the law is enforced and that's what what when you have lawlessness i mean the law's not being enforced and all that does is lawlessness we were we went on a mission trip to Manhattan	#telephone#	telephone_sw2571-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

uh-huh like you say kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're	going	to do and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus	#telephone#	telephone_sw2575-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah i don't and i don't understand the reasoning for it i really don't it it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's	going	to take public money then they should return something to the public i mean if nothing else go out along an interstate and pick up garbage	#telephone#	telephone_sw2575-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

oh yeah yeah i think the government is it's own worst enemy about the time it was all	going	on they were trying to run a loose monetary policy anyhow to stimulate the economy and plus they had cut back on the way of government regulators to even investigate or keep a watchdog on the whole industry and uh i think the whole economic situation was set up to uh put the savings and loans in the position they were in and they mainly the banks too	#telephone#	telephone_sw2591-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh monitoring in that respect then it did get out of hand and you're right you're absolutely right there were some people who saw the situation for what it was and they took advantage of it and uh because of it you and i are the main taxpayers now are	going	to have to pay not only for the burden of the bad investments that they made but we're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2591-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um yeah it's it's one of the reasons why you know The Godfather's been on our minds lately um but uh there's a bunch of scenes from uh uh from The Godfather that's used because Matthew Broderick's	going	to film school and uh in his classes they're using there's a bunch they're running a bunch of scenes from The Godfather and then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing you know this Mafia you know this uh organized crime head uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2598-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

i'm not sure i want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision uh i mean uh that that doesn't sound right um i guess i see overall beneficial if if we're	going	from that point of view uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2604-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well i guess it's gonna depend on how i mean if if you're talking about any if you're talking about something that's like a full time you know one year full time you know this is what you do you know you're	going	to go and and fill pot holes and you know and you know all that stuff i mean i you know i don't know	#telephone#	telephone_sw2604-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um i'm quite concerned that if you let everyone who hasn't yet used a gun in a felony uh haven't hasn't yet committed a felony if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario you're	going	to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2634-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

it's it's hard for me to imagine that a a situation of you know take it to it's logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying guns you're not	going	to have an increase in gunfire i actually it's not it's more of a police action in itself the fact that everybody's packing a piece is a deterrent is a deterrence to someone saying well i'm	#telephone#	telephone_sw2634-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

right as a matter of fact i want to think they took the top managers first isn't that a fact i've been retired from TI about a year but the program you know was still fairly new i guess it had been	going	on maybe almost a year uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2638-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that's right that's not	going	to help anybody get over the problem i believe it is a a a medical problem no absolute	#telephone#	telephone_sw2638-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh you know because they just flat out weren't	going	to put up with the policy uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2638-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh you know they had a lifestyle and they weren't	going	to change it yep right yeah i know a lot of people who	#telephone#	telephone_sw2638-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah yeah i mean uh you should have no objection to it it's like uh	going	down to get your license and checking your eyes i mean you know why do i need my eyes checked well we want to make sure you can see that's right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2638-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i mean if you have uh you know if you're not working with someone on drugs well then you're	going	to have less accidents and you have less accidents and you spend less money on medical and you spend less money on medical then the company's more profitable uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2638-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh mandatory drug testing we'll reduce your insurance costs by you know twenty per cent and of course you know the company's not	going	to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent they're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2638-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah so it i i think i think all around it it's	going	to help out a lot course yeah i do too	#telephone#	telephone_sw2638-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that's true if if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket and sometimes you may think well i don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something yeah yeah and it gives you a sense um a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say oh well i don't have to pay for it now but you're	going	to have to pay for it and it seems like yeah you think well i don't have it now but payday will come and then i'll have the money but that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time yes	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum that's	going	to take up what you would have made um	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh you get that stuff in the mail all the time yes yes and then i'll i'll have just like uh department stores they'll call me up you know and i'll say look i don't want the credit card well we're just	going	to send it to you you know you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to they'll send me any credit card i tear it up what i really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that i do have still that they send you these things that look like checks	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but it this is her first credit card thing well when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal look at this they sent me this money you know so then when i explained to her look you have to pay this back and they are	going	to charge you interest and stuff of course she ter tore it up but a lot of parents would not take the time you know and they wouldn't even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and i are	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i have seen so many people and i have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen she got uh i can't remember what she called it it's some kind of maybe it's sure or something like that it's something it's some weird name of a credit card and she is charging out of her mind already and i'm	going	you just got off uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i mean i cannot hardly tolerate to owe something like you know i guess it's just because i've been brought up like that but um i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was	going	to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to pay out but that's just the way i feel about it	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you know you just have to have these things just you know have them at home have to have them at my own place and that's you know a big expenditure to start um buying all these things that you think or or have to have and actually they're kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place you know	going	in one big swoop save up and then buy it right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well we're geared to that we're like okay like i want a living room set and instead of sitting back and and	going	okay well it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
the oh yes it certainly does and familiarity with the area there's sometimes advantages to moving way off and	going	to a unknown area but uh there's as many right well for example yeah yeah i i think that's very true because for example uh i'm	#telephone#	telephone_sw2644-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh yes it certainly does and familiarity with the area there's sometimes advantages to moving way off and	going	to a unknown area but uh there's as many right well for example yeah yeah i i think that's very true because for example uh i'm	#telephone#	telephone_sw2644-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i think also you know um dialogue between university professors helps a lot in decisions because i think that's what really turned me towards that you know the the school that i'm	going	to is i went and talked to the people in the school and they gave me information which i could not have gotten otherwise and that that really finalized my decision um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2644-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum um-hum so i'm kind of branching off into a pretty specific region which i think is	going	to be a hot topic in the future with you know all these lands and and things that are being spoiled no question	#telephone#	telephone_sw2644-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so are you happy with what you're doing now yeah i am kind of happy with it it it's getting better all the time i knew it would be different from the very beginning but you know as as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's	going	on with the system so i was in the computer operations it's uh you know it all starts to become similar there's you know there's benefits and there's things that weren't as good but as an overall package i'd say i i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out	#telephone#	telephone_sw2645-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or or	going	for walks in the mountains i can't seem to get into it right now exactly	#telephone#	telephone_sw2645-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah funny how that happens after kids right that uh those type of qualities have uh moved into the picture and then there's there's some economic concern but usually it's if if it's	going	to be a night out it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah they do oddly enough even being near near the gulf uh they tend to advertise the the main the whole east coast uh seafood for some reason it tends to be a draw i don't know particularly why i mean to me it tastes pretty much the same once you do to it whatever you're	going	to do to it you know like oh is that right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and um but not as often we don't do it as often um and what i'm finding now is they're finally getting to the age where we're venturing into	going	again with them and of course when you take them though you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
um and what i'm finding now is they're finally getting to the age where we're venturing into	going	again with them and of course when you take them though you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	1	go	come	drive	walk	arrive
i i i tend to agree with you too we look for more um uh quiet type more of a subdued atmosphere now and i think part of that is after you have kids you're you're not as interested in	going	to uh Georgetown type places where you know you go in every place and there's a lot of uh noise right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and um not all of them do take reservations either so so you sometimes have to allot yourself uh enough time um you know to go out uh you can't figure on	going	out and being back in two hours you know um the other thing that's changing here is because of the um the age set here uh a lot mostly people in they're i'd say late twenties to early forties in these neighborhoods that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um to children and making half price menus for them whereas before um they would be totally discouraged from bringing children in and they're doing this basically because they're so many working parents in this area and that they were losing the business because once all these younger people were having children they weren't	going	to the restaurants right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh uh-huh i think uh a lot of a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college a lot of the students that i talked to even here in Waco they go to Baylor um they or they're considering	going	to Baylor they're also considering	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right being as worldly as i could possibly be getting into as many organizations as i could possibly could and and one other point i was	going	to make was that i can understand i can see that probably if i had gone to a smaller school i would probably have more friends	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh i was	going	to ask who won you know what she what she wants anyway but that was the big deal and	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you know what she what she wants anyway but that was the big deal and in in that case uh regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was	going	for what she needed and finding a school that that met her specific requirements and and made the best fit for her right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and that that's another point is that the a parent should tell their child to be or or to give their child the leeway to choose their school not so much choose the school for them but you know kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're	going	to do yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i think it helps uh uh now my grandfather was	going	to pay if i went to uh what's now UT Arlington because it was there in my hometown i could live at home but i chose to go to another school um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum and the you you made the right choice in	going	to a school that met all of your needs to make to give you the the potential to do whatever you wanted right because when you when you do want when you do finally graduate	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh but when they pollute into the air and you've got you know and you've got movement through the air it's	going	to move a lot of that off so i don't see you know how they can do some of the tests unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution you know like in Los Angeles or or the bigger cities where it it tends to get stuck there you know that you have a lot more particles in the air	#telephone#	telephone_sw2648-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh and this article said that they've got a real problem that um you've got toxins and and uh bacteria in the manure that is what it's doing is it's	going	through uh they don't have a very deep um oh you know they're water	#telephone#	telephone_sw2648-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh now that's bad right i was	going	to say the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was	#telephone#	telephone_sw2648-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
when you think about the you know thinking of just air pollution itself and then and channel thirteen they're really um emphasizing the problem with acid rain you know if we if we keep putting that stuff into the air and and you know if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really	going	to be a problem for um uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2648-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh just the the Earth you know what the Earth is receiving back you know because how can you tell where it's	going	to come down at yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2648-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you know as far as seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying okay we're really	going	to get involved it it's really becoming a problem by the year two thousand there will what what are we	#telephone#	telephone_sw2648-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that has been taken away it's not there anymore i mean that thing was always full because people really brought stuff to it all the time and uh then they took it away for no real reason that i can understand or i ever heard about and it's not there anymore and the only place to take things to recycle them is like clear off on the other side of town and who's	going	to do that very few people that's right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2649-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
or or two thousand people uh you know just scattered throughout the city you know who who wouldn't mind just you know why	going	down that way anyway just throw things in the back of your car and right right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2649-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
for it it's easy to say but for a lot of people to do you know if you were building a house and you were	going	to spend you know fifty thousand versus twenty thousand on mat erials because your yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2649-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah you're	going	to you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2649-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and yeah you mean you're	going	to do what you can that's right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2649-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh i i just knew today uh you know we looked at the pound and and that we just went all over the place and i knew we were	going	to find him you know and when we didn't it was like oh no so i don't know well i i'll i hope you'll find him you most likely will	#telephone#	telephone_sw2650-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i guess that's yeah i guess that's probably true i don't think it's anything we did least i would hope not no i i know i mean he's always you know he really does have a good home i think that's what really and see what's	going	on no no i'm sure that yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2650-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

that's true and and i've been looking at these um uh like in Home Depot where you can go and they've got that ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the um uh what the the the door and uh and then you can have actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall you know to have it permanently attached and that's what i'm thinking i'm	going	to have to do because mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom and it's just uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2652-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yes that's been a hot topic yeah traffic deal yeah it's a real yeah really was and of and of course everybody's reaction to that was you know anger and disgust and shock and all of that but then when you turn around and look at at what's	going	on um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2654-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i don't know either soon that it's we're really	going	to be in a lot worse trouble than we are now yeah it's obviously not getting any better	#telephone#	telephone_sw2654-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

i wonder now in and i've been out of school too long to answer this but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses there probably are you know for but i'm sure that's probably like people that do that are social are the people that are	going	to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize that it's everybody's responsibility	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah that's exactly it they're not	going	to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it now come on let's be realistic that's just not realistic yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i guess we're getting kind of off the subject here but yeah i mean it's no we're not i don't think i think that's more realistic than	going	making them go in the Peace Corps true yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
farther you know farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing i was that's exactly what i was	going	to ask you have you ever have have you been downtown recently	#telephone#	telephone_sw2657-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right okay i'm	going	to let you kind of lead the pack because you sound like you're i let let me tell you just a little bit about myself i for years i did all that shopping and what not but for the last four or five years i've had eye problem and i've had two cornea transplants	#telephone#	telephone_sw2658-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and i think that's really really important well because these guys if they um give us a hard time we're	going	to say you look you know if you if you can't fix this to our satisfaction we're just returning the computer yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2658-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but i was wondering like you know in our case we we knew we were buying a copy we weren't buying an IBM PC and i was wondering if you yeah no i think this is a i think this is maybe a name brand and i suspect that it's probably just a fluke you know i have the papers and everything and we're	going	to get just take it back but uh uh-huh did you buy it at some major store	#telephone#	telephone_sw2658-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah and i guess it depends you know if if it's just you and your husband	going	out to eat uh unless it's uh anniversary or something like that atmosphere doesn't mean that much but if you're taking another couple or taking relatives or friends or something you want the place you know to be nice	#telephone#	telephone_sw2659-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum it looks like it's gonna the last few episodes are	going	to be good yeah yeah matter of fact uh i guess that's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2666-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah because i it it's pretty obvious though like Corbin Benson is probably not	going	to be there long because he's been starring in these uh miniseries and and his part's gotten smaller and smaller and they're bringing on the uh like the British uh lawyer who uh uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2666-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
it sure is it sure is it sure is how about you do you exercise on a regular basis um well i try to um i started at the beginning of this year i decided all right i'm	going	to start exercising again i'm	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh and it cost sixty dollars and i thought okay that's not cheap that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money and i had a friend of mine	going	so i was real good i only missed it about three times right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right yeah walking is kind of boring i do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood and we try to we used to try to get together and i think now that the weather's getting nicer we're	going	to start doing it again and occasionally go walking there's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex uh-huh uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right it's just hard to make yourself go and i i think one thing i don't like about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night and i've been sweaty and and it you know i don't really feel like	going	in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands so it kind of kills the yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
does it cost the same for just two nights or no it's less expensive this one was only forty five dollars but i'm glad it's not too totally cheap because if it was too c heap i would talk myself out of	going	more probably well that's good too	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah yeah it's right there and it's they have a really nice facility at the TI they've got two different aerobics rooms they have the mirrors of course sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall you don't like to see how you work but i guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get	going	but no	#telephone#	telephone_sw2667-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

you	going	to Motorola no i'm	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right right and would then and and that's significant and every once in a while they make noises like they're	going	to take that out and that would just kill the housing industry if they did oh yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and and so i i got this three thousand foot five bedroom house that i've got almost paid off and have all kinds of equity in it and don't have and you know struggling to keep i've got two children in college and i'm	going	to have three by September oh man	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and and the way they keep proposing fixing that is to raise taxes spend more money i think what would cure that problem is to consolidate some of these schools and they wouldn't have so much money	going	to so many different schools yeah well that plus that fact that you look into the we've got some very good private schools here and more and more people are sending their children private schools and what you look in the private schools is they've got a higher proportion of people on the payroll that are teaching	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh and and get them in the classroom plus uh i don't know it seems to me that that more so than when i went to school there are a lot of courses that aren't	going	allow first first of all they're not college prep courses and i don't think they're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well now if they propose this the if this you know state income tax goes through are they	going	to lower the sales tax i don't know i i don't i bet they're not i i'll absolutely bet they're not it it's interesting i wish i knew this question was coming up because i've only heard of it in bits and pieces	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i don't know i i don't i bet they're not i i'll absolutely bet they're not it it's interesting i wish i knew this question was coming up because i've only heard of it in bits and pieces but apparently there was a bill before the federal legislature today to uh lower social security tax but the other end of it they were	going	to raise income taxes oh man	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh man they were	going	to they were	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah that was a really good course yeah and and i was i was	going	to ask you what did you think of it relevant to some of	#telephone#	telephone_sw2668-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i i don't know uh i think they just ought to you know start uh just go all all the way you know new products introduced or whatever you know start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts and you know people if they have to are	going	to learn to think that way yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2669-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum you know liters of gasoline people are	going	to learn to think in metric as long as you can still buy a product in the English units that's how you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw2669-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
points yeah so i don't know i think as long as people have a choice they're	going	to stick with the American way i	#telephone#	telephone_sw2669-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
most of the body parts seem to be metric and most of the engine parts seem to be SAE so it's well i guess it just gets bad down to you got to you got to have one and not mix them up because you're never	going	to get to one one system if you still still got a got a mix it's just crazy	#telephone#	telephone_sw2669-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah it upseted me to realize that hey the recycling that they're	going	through the expense of recycling but people aren't buying it so the cost of it is higher true yeah i noticed that about things like i seen i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers	#telephone#	telephone_sw2672-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah i'm forever	going	back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out i wish they'd really push this recycling bit because i never realized i really didn't realize how much stuff i actually throw away well i think the the more people are aware of it the the more they'll do i think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2672-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

i think it would be a detriment to crime or would be a deterrent to crime because i know someone who's mad isn't	going	to think well gosh i can't do this or they'll put me away but somehow i think if the punishment doesn't fit the crime the crime's more likely to happen	#telephone#	telephone_sw2674-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and it is five bedrooms she said you you it's really hard to find that and most places places have four and there are people that really want five so that's another plus so it might be closer to three months and you know we'll be if we're real lucky we won't lose any money you know we'll we'll be able it's mostly the closing costs that are	going	to um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2705-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum that you we can we'll be be uh asking for more than we bought the house for three years ago but the closing costs are	going	to eat out just about all of it so so maybe you can get enough to cover that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2705-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah then we'll feel really we'll feel good about it so are you you you you're basically	going	to have to sell that one before you can so	#telephone#	telephone_sw2705-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

uh-huh i think they thought that was	going	to be a great boom crop uh hundred and fifty years ago because they are all over the place	#telephone#	telephone_sw2707-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
this past week and uh my wife and everyone ask me what what are they	going	to accomplish out of all this and i said well you're not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2707-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right uh-huh you know so you it's	going	to be much faster of course you know the classical thing for the handicapped too person who can't type very fast or	#telephone#	telephone_sw2707-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and they go to college etcetera well it seems to me that kids that are get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in	going	to college and forced into it usually are your drop outs where if they're said hey it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like	#telephone#	telephone_sw2708-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh my perception of the budget you know the government and they have so much to spend and there's not enough money to spread around but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries and that we have more money or goods you know more money	going	out and too many goods coming into this country you know and um you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country	#telephone#	telephone_sw2708-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and and obviously the the demand for their goods is quite high here so they can get their goods in here and um you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know we're	going	to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours but um	#telephone#	telephone_sw2708-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
they're in i think you're you're	going	to find that just because the United States you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh uh the money you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell you know we don't uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2708-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and it's kind it really is kind of scary because there's there's just oodles of them and you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals and it's kind it's kind of scares me not that i don't want them here and not that i don't appreciate the fact that you know that they have rights too but on the other hand you feel like almost they're they're invading us to the point where they're	going	to take over right actually my son once said that that perhaps um what we should do is is buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest and and that might be the solution	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and you know they're just extremely bright kids and also they value learning i was	going	to say i'm not sure i i would guess that it's not that they are any brighter but they just maybe work harder or well i i think things come easy for them too but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States i don't	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well and exactly that's exactly true plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them and and uh plus a lot of American dollars but in in the long run maybe that's	going	to make a better world too you know you just don't know right right exactly	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

uh-huh and that's you know that's the way they wanted to do it and he was surprised because he thought there was	going	to be a problem because he uh you know some people on the case were were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but i mean when it all came down they just	#telephone#	telephone_sw2717-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life that you know you never know when they're	going	to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not yeah yeah i agree	#telephone#	telephone_sw2717-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum and everybody's differences of opinion are probably good that's what makes our you know well yeah i'm you know i just you know i just couldn't understand what uh Sarah Sarah Brady just needs something to do i mean this doesn't seem to be you know what is she really	going	to accomplish if this goes through i mean it's really not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2721-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

i think people who own guns ought to be held responsible for things that happen with those weapons yeah i thought that was the case i mean if uh if my kid grabs my gun and goes and shoots somebody i would really have the feeling that they're	going	to come banging on my door well i saw a talk show just the other night where uh there was a mother on the show and her uh son had been killed in a neighbor's house by one of the neighbor's handguns	#telephone#	telephone_sw2731-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so i don't know i think the law should be tightened up on on gun ownership but i can't see a total ban on it at all uh because then you're still	going	to have criminals with guns and it's not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2731-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well i've heard it said that that's one of the reasons why we're not as much a threat to be attacked by other countries because everybody and his brother's got a gun at home and what are you	going	to do about that You got two hundred million guns here and it's uh it's more than just an army	#telephone#	telephone_sw2731-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

it seems to be yeah it seems to be um the interest rates just went down i don't know i would imagine that's	going	to encourage more people to uh to look to buy a house uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2746-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

it was kind of neat to see it finally all come together yeah that's nice i'd started to redo the basement in uh in our house in New Hampshire i was	going	to make it into like a family room and i'd started putting the flooring in and stuff but i never finished it the uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2746-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah the uh all the all the communities in Rhode Island eventually are	going	to go on this like the recycling that we have now it depends on on each individual municipality uh we went on it quite early because of the town fathers said yeah you know we think it's a good idea	#telephone#	telephone_sw2747-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh so i think this summer i'm	going	to take on the kitchen first and then try to do the others because i want to pull up the carpeting and put hardwood all through the house oh okay	#telephone#	telephone_sw2748-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right i figure by by doing it before i put in the carpeting you know the carpet is so bad whatever i spill it's too bad right well that's that's a good idea get get the pointing over with and then the carpet's	going	to go anyway right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2748-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh exterior that long that would be uh i i thought so you know i would say no less than definitely no less than five i think if your exterior paint is peeling after a year or two then there's probably something	going	on with the wood uh uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2748-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh i don't know uh that that's my impression people don't do the outsides as often i know in this neighborhood it seemed like last year everybody was	going	crazy to have their exterior painted and that was the the first time for most people but that's just trim right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2748-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so i'm not i'm not sure two years would be too often i don't want to do it that often i know i was	going	to say what a mess no no i don't want to it's a that's one of the things i don't enjoy painting that much i guess uh it's okay for a while but i find it gets it gets uh boring or tiring pretty quickly so yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2748-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
no no not at all i i i think that uh what uh the the work that i've done that's one reason i do it uh if if i really felt that it was	going	to be a sloppy job and i was sorry you afterward the way it looks i wouldn't attempt to take it on but uh there are a few tricks you know that you learn to use and i've found that uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2748-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh so i'm	going	to have to ask her what the trick is she'll probably say hire me to come down and do it yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2748-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah yeah well i don't yeah that's right i don't i don't know i guess maybe the trick with the pads on the ceiling is that you have to put a minimal amount of paint on there you probably aren't	going	to be able to cover as much of a surface as you would if you're doing it on a wall because if it drips you can just sort of smooth it all out uh right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2748-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and uh or they fool the the defense in thinking that they're you know because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want oh of course it's it's political maneuvering the the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will you know want to hang everyone and the other one is	going	to look for someone very sympathetic they're not looking for someone whose	#telephone#	telephone_sw2749-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah uh i think you need to plan on you need to be sure and plan uh at least a year ahead of time or you're	going	to lose people you know they have to plan their vacations that far ahead a little bit	#telephone#	telephone_sw2750-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

there was a history of his father and mother but there was no history on them so i spent the two years before that compiling and and writing the history and then we gave it out at that this year we're not we're we're combining it in the and the parents before and so we're	going	to do some um uh acting out of of these groups and try to help them get better acquainted and mostly it's a different kind of thing so we're we're just kind of playing it by ear and seeing how it goes i think	#telephone#	telephone_sw2750-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air i would hope that they would help some though that's for sure well i think uh it seems like there was something	going	on around around here that you know we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kinds of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that um	#telephone#	telephone_sw2752-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of uh pollutants in our food but water pollution uh i've worried uh especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like i know a lot more people are	going	to bottled water um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2752-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

i talked to one in California i never asked him the other day how he was connected i don't think he was TI employee um i um most people talk to Texas there's been a couple of other the people um most of whom are like me that work in in speech labs that are	going	to use data base eventually oh i see	#telephone#	telephone_sw2756-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh because i i'm i think i'm dead smack in the middle i think that if there is	going	to be a ban on gun control that it should be enforced like you said and i feel like if there if if there is a band put upon us it wouldn't be a forced enforced just like um there's suppose to be working on a drug problem suppose be working on our education problems	#telephone#	telephone_sw2757-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but uh the Brady Bill won't do anything but just make it harder for the people that are honest to buy one those those that are criminals which are the ones that are refusing guns in the first place uh they're not	going	to walk in and buy one anyway the reason i think i'm so cloudy on the issue is because i mean it it i want to protect myself but at the same time i don't want anyone to have a gun that could harm me	#telephone#	telephone_sw2757-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you know for you know a couple of hundred years right but everyone weren't they weren't	going	around killing each other that's true unless of course there was you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw2757-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right uh-huh i mean you you have to because i i mean i don't have a gun it just scares me to have one but i feel like that very soon i'm	going	to have to get one just because i would probably feel safer and	#telephone#	telephone_sw2757-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right now i have a knife under the seat in my car uh if i'm	going	anywhere at night anywhere i mean if i'm just stepping outside my door i carry something on me if i'm you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw2757-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh uh-huh now that's just you know that we're talking about somebody whose crazy having a gun law is not	going	to stop him because he's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2757-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and there are people yeah they're people doing that so i mean the the solution is not to pass more laws than you can't enforce because they're they're	going	to pass one now they're trying too either the Staggers Bill or the Brady Bill yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2757-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum either way they do it it's	going	to cost you and me more money right and not probably	#telephone#	telephone_sw2757-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

because and and and we're	going	to increase the bureaucracy that's supposed to handle it and what are they	#telephone#	telephone_sw2757-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

yeah i think it's really important to that that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that you know we're not just	going	on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them that that kind of gripes on me some but yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2770-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

as long as we 've got so many other crazy things	going	on in society yeah i i think that eventually the the family unit's just not	#telephone#	telephone_sw2790-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
it's it is that like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that i think there's	going	to be more single parent families than there are um	#telephone#	telephone_sw2790-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah it is i guess unless unless there's a a major swing in the change of what's important to people you know probably keep	going	downhill and i i don't know we we feel like that that we can make it on one income it it may be tough but we may have to give up some	#telephone#	telephone_sw2790-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and that is just a horrible waste of money i think and it's and it's done because some constituent you know i well it's done because they want to impress the the people that are	going	to vote for him next month um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2791-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i've i've really gotten cynical i guess as i've gotten older but i've i've been watching you know the the campaigns and stuff and it's it just it's just amazing how little anybody really says right or well duh i thought you were	going	to say what they do oh that too	#telephone#	telephone_sw2791-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

that's right when we're in a wor ld of hurt well i don't i'm not	going	to say that we ought to reduce	#telephone#	telephone_sw2794-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and then they scream about that that or the uh politicians scream about they're	going	to try and not raise taxes but they vote in a raise for themselves every year oh yes that that's the uh the type of thing that really irritates me where they can get significant increases when everyone else is facing layoffs or or cutbacks or	#telephone#	telephone_sw2795-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

you know and turn drastically but i i think uh if we're	going	to waste money i'd almost see rather see us waste it at home than overseas too and that there's some unusual	#telephone#	telephone_sw2795-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but as long as you've got career politicians that spend twenty five to forty five years in Washington playing power broker they're not	going	to do anything to tap tap out the well yeah well your your neighbor to the north Oklahoma just voted for state legislators uh one term	#telephone#	telephone_sw2795-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and i think the thing about the ones that are really up there doing what they were elected to do it doesn't matter if they're in that office or not if they have to sit out a term fine they're	going	to be able to do things behind the scenes either in the capacity of the lobbyist or in	#telephone#	telephone_sw2795-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

be a part of a yeah a world that's halfway decent and you know just in my lifetime i've seen such a change in the environment and it's scary because by the time my kids have kids and they're growing up it's	going	to be a completely different world you know and it's it's scary so yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you could easily say well we should go back to living in caves but no one's	going	to do that so i think you need to make compromises slowly enough people adjust to it and uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2802-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i don't know i guess it's just me but i don't know whether to trust that or not i mean there are so many scams and things	going	on you know i would love to help somebody i know	#telephone#	telephone_sw2803-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

right and it's much less than clear to me that as a military power um there's	going	to be anything left uh given that anything like that happens right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um and they so so i guess since the primary question is whether or not it's a military problem that's less than clear to me i mean if they're smart they're just	going	to let us head toward communism on our own very merry way that's right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i see i don't think they're	going	to you know somehow import communism to us i i agree with that i don't believe that will happen	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah oh well so that's uh what what's	going	to be real interesting is if when they have the next presidential elections um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum if Bush is	going	to run with Quayle again yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah or if he's	going	to run with someone else which i think would be uh i wonder if that's if there's precedent for that where uh there's uh same president but a different vice president uh i think so i can't think off hand who	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum uh and uh that's i you know i'd love to see that happen but i doubt it's	going	to happen in the next fifty years you don't think so	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
personally i i i really as i said i would really love to see it happen but i just i just i can't see them maintaining the missile bases in fact i think if the Soviet government starts retreating you know because of these civil wars and stuff the first thing they're	going	to do is close down the mi ssile bases in the republics um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh under the fear because they're not	going	to want them to fall into the Republic's hands i see under the fear that that uh Moscow Moscow gets bombed first that's a good point that's a very good point in fact	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
might be used against them that's right and so i think just from that there's	going	to be some limited amounts of disarmament they'll still be republics with the missiles the ones that are under the firmer control of the of the Soviets right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2809-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh really nevertheless it's not exactly the thing that's	going	to make you bucks right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
so you know so there's that end of it too and and i think it's	going	to really you know so i don't	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah it sure	going	to make a big difference in our school system yeah it is	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh in order to accommodate the extra teaching that's	going	to be needed because they're eliminating all aids	#telephone#	telephone_sw2810-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

well i was real happy with our contractor um actually i wasn't happy with the contractor i was happy with the job foreman so i think that made all the difference because he was pretty um you know concerned about how it looked and and you know how it should be done the right way and he gave us a lot of clues you just wish you knew all this stuff	going	in that um it was funny because we didn't understand a lot of things that we had to do in addition to this you know like the tape and bedding and and doing finishing off this wall and that wall that wasn't in the contract you know kind of thing	#telephone#	telephone_sw2814-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

or she maybe maybe it's just a preference that she's taking it on herself but she is taking a computer class yeah and uh but yeah it's that's something that's	going	to be uh a necessity for accountants because you you know it's you can do so much for more work with a computer then you can do you know doing it manually yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2822-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but you know and so we try not to even take that as part of our budget we just try to put that right away in savings it's very difficult sometimes to to not think and say well God we have a little bit in savings let's you know but you have to be quite um adamant and say you're not	going	to touch that so yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah and and there i don't think there's a lot of opportunity uh in the future for grants and loans and that kind of stuff because i don't i just don't think it's	going	to be there yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah so i think if parents don't provide it's it's not	going	to be there it's too hard	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and uh who knows how much that's	going	to take i mean what we're taking out now may be enough it may not be and uh just don't know or there may be far more there than is ever needed but if it's if it's extra yeah yeah exactly	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum but we've always managed you know to you know to get out of it fairly quickly we don't have a lot charged up on credit cards we don't have you know a lot of money	going	out right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i i project ahead i usually at the end of the month when i when i pay the bills i'll usually project what i'm	going	to need for next month but i don't really put it aside i just you know i just try to estimate what i think it's	#telephone#	telephone_sw2823-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and within about a month i would say i had ten fifteen calls from different brokers uh asking me questions all sorts of things about what i would be willing interested in investing in and how much i had to invest and and i was kind of curious and i guess i got my answer but it was uh a bit much and to this day it has continued considerably it's i guess it's	going	to be hard to get off of that little list now yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
credit references uh when you dial that in to find out well what's their latest rating uh that kind of information you don't always want everybody to know but uh it's	going	across uh computer lines and people can pick up what they want so right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right uh you know you name anything that's ever happened to you is	going	to be tied into either your social security number or your driver's license it's kind of sad that they choose that number to identify you with because there's very few you know some people use it just because it's easy and it's unique and then some people use it to yeah you can now identify that person it's not quite so private anymore	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and uh i don't know i very little of the information i give out really bothers me but as far as whether i care if anybody else had it but uh i guess the idea that if you ever let it become a an all right thing to do for the masses then you'll never be able to get that privilege back once gone it's	going	to be gone forever right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

that's right that's right and and when there's nobody there i always thought too that you know people worrying about	going	to work when their child when their children are little and i and i think that's sad if they have to because they miss so much	#telephone#	telephone_sw2826-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

and then if you paid them more you'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them i think that's absolutely right they the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board you're	going	to be uh rewarding people who've been doing a lousy job and instead of getting the uh improvement that we want so we'd have to have some way to	#telephone#	telephone_sw2828-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i don't know if i i'm in favor yeah in favor of yeah i think especially in the younger years you need to have more of the the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to to learn how to learn i don't think that's	going	to work yeah well another thing i think would be helpful would be to have some sort of uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2828-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
definitely is and i hope maybe we're	going	to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with uh Reagan's uh new education secretary and uh you know trying to do some uh trying to produce some new programs anyway	#telephone#	telephone_sw2828-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

the only problem that we have here are are you know just very minute sort of crime we have neighborhood crime watch programs and then the uh city police patrol the areas at least one a day and when you're not at home you're to notify your neighbors of course that you know you're	going	out of time et cetera et cetera and not do the things that are so obvious to uh potential right get someone to pick up your papers and your mail	#telephone#	telephone_sw2986-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

gone through that uh i remember my parents didn't do all those type things and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that and even now with my grandchildren i feel it's a very important thing to be done right because if uh kids don't look up to you or or can't can't feel they can spend time with you they're	going	to find someone else and uh yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2989-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

right they typeset they don't usually break words in a newspaper if the if one line is	going	to be a lot shorter than another line they just they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines right	#telephone#	telephone_sw2991-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but some of them are and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that it that just a a basic general user can understand them so i think um people think it's	going	to take them a lot longer to learn it properly than it really would and so they're really wasting time rather than saving themselves time because they think well it's quicker just to do it myself when it's really not right um-hum it's better to learn it directly from the manual	#telephone#	telephone_sw2991-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

absolutely yeah before it's really	going	very well because um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw3063-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
now the adults are more aware of it and the children are being taught in the schools more it'll be you know on down the road this is	going	to be passed on which is good absolutely yes uh of course uh we would like to see it accelerated because uh of the critical nature of it	#telephone#	telephone_sw3063-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

that circulates and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top and then that's the way it's kept in order and then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is	going	on and when you meet them at the reunion you don't feel like i don't know anything about this person you've you've read something about what is	#telephone#	telephone_sw3067-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and then that's the way it's kept in order and then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is	going	on and when you meet them at the reunion you don't feel like i don't know anything about this person you've you've read something about what is	#telephone#	telephone_sw3067-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right we tried to start that in my husband's family his mother's side decided they were	going	to have a reunion a couple of years ago and i said well let's start this letter and it just never my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got i sent it on to the next one and and but we are	#telephone#	telephone_sw3067-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
we tried to start that in my husband's family his mother's side decided they were	going	to have a reunion a couple of years ago and i said well let's start this letter and it just never my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got i sent it on to the next one and and but we are	#telephone#	telephone_sw3067-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
well Steve did you go to college yeah in fact i'm still	going	oh that's good so you probably could give some great advice	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum and the kid at that age especially if they're	going	into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want an and i mean choosing from my experience you know my i thought you know my i know what i want a lot more than my parents know what i want yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i hate to talk to the parents because um one of the reasons is because you know the kid doesn't know exactly what they want and i always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not	going	to be your career vocation because you'll get better grades i i think most employers would probably rather hire you know a a three six in um in history uh to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
that make sense yeah i always you know tell them that you should major in something you you're	going	to get good grades in because that that's always i think more important yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah yeah yeah i think uh i would agree with that in fact the thing that i'm	going	through the same thing where in graduate school i was trying to choose you know a particular institution might be better um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
but i don't yeah i think you're right you really have to think about that for the job i went to a very small state college when i got my bachelor's and when i now i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs i was	going	to be a teacher i was just a high school teacher so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of you know but then when i went um	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i i guess another thing that concerns me is uh so many people it seems like everybody today is still in that job market and uh um where was i at oh	going	in	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um where was i at oh	going	in	#telephone#	telephone_sw3068-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
oh i know sometimes i just i'm in it just takes a very long time so does it yeah i've been trying to you know do that and and sometimes i just can't wait that long so i just hang up because it keeps	going	through the thing over and over again yeah i know well	#telephone#	telephone_sw3069-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and um you know a lot of hanky-panky	going	on yeah yeah that kind of was um kind of a pop psychology time for when when a lot of books like that were coming out i think	#telephone#	telephone_sw3069-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah and now i i mean i think it's around here somewhere i'm just	going	to have to put it in the car sometimes and listen to it right i wouldn't be surprised yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3069-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
right i wouldn't be surprised yeah sure oh yeah well i read that and then i'm trying to think um usually i try to to find something long that i'm	going	to do but um	#telephone#	telephone_sw3069-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum when if if i have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or you know when i know i'm not	going	to be doing anything for a while um yeah oh that's what i do too	#telephone#	telephone_sw3069-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving

um-hum well it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it	going	along ours ours is still kind of loosely organized and the same people usually get stuck with doing it and yeah well	#telephone#	telephone_sw3082-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah i i i i think that the biggest problem is uh with the uh with the the home environment being part of it you know if i think too many parents expect uh the the school to teach uh the moral aspects of of things to the students to the kids and you know while we're not	going	to worry about uh teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then uh	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then uh expect them to to pick it up at school and you're not	going	to do that you know you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
the uh schools like that that where you got a lot of kids who are basically uh that might be more well to well off you know	going	to a private Catholic school or whatever uh and and they're not all that way but you know some that are um yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah that they're they're they're not quite the same as as the kids that are	going	to the inner city uh you know public schools yeah this is interesting because i in my mind i don't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment but uh this this was actually inner city	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
they didn't send him to a public school you know you have like you said you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance well you know in a lot of cases uh like that where you know if kids are	going	to a public parochial school like that it's it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving them uh uh an education it shows i think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know and that may be	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh i think that's a big part of it you know people you know if you don't care about property and people you know you're not	going	to care about uh about learning i think	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
yeah you know you're not	going	to really care about yourself yeah that's what i was	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
you know you're not	going	to really care about yourself yeah that's what i was	#telephone#	telephone_sw3083-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and it is true and uh i but i think that would but as far as looking for a place you know i i the criteria i mean i think it's very important to have very caring people you know to take care of the the in a school if you're	going	to have the structure and you're	#telephone#	telephone_sw3085-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
i recently stopped by McDonald's and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center and of course she was she had just gotten her degree and she was so enthusiastic and she was excited about it and she was	going	to accomplish all of these things yes yes	#telephone#	telephone_sw3085-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
and at that point i said look they have been given the custodial care that they need and the after hours care has been as good a quality as i can provide for them however they're	going	out into the school environment now they're under a lot of other influences i need to be here for them i need to be involved in their school because i want to be the one yes	#telephone#	telephone_sw3085-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
um-hum um-hum to develop the kinds of things that that they're	going	to need to interact with other people i felt like i needed some strong influence there yeah well that's different than most people do it i mean a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school you know	#telephone#	telephone_sw3085-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh and i was just really grateful i only had one bad child care experience it was in a home uh the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it she was from um uh uh Argentina and she was	going	back home and i couldn't just you know wait for eight three or four months and then bring them back to her so i had to find a new place um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw3085-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
uh-huh they learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they didn't learn but they're	going	to learn it sometime so but for the most part they did have good care yeah yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw3085-ms98-a-trans.txt	go	spoken	OANC_spoken	2	going	coming	driving	walking	arriving
