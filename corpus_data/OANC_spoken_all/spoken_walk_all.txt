you know in terms of verifying who they are and what they're saying and and uh you know people could uh use that you know<n>or the other option i guess is to i mean why do you even have to do it over the phone why couldn't you just walk up to the booth and and uh register right there and then they have with uh everything hooked up by the computer you could say okay you've already voted<n>where do you live yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw4467-ms98-a-trans.txt
