ave in finished, work-in-process, and material inventories. [SEP] They must know the lead-time requirements for procuring textile products and establish relationships with at least some textile suppliers that allow the apparel-maker to procure fabric in smaller quantities and with shorter lead times. [SEP] This supplier must draw on production lines and sourcing arrangements that provide it with a range of response times, from short-cycle production capacity for products with high demand variability to lines or sourcing arrangements that create larger production runs at lower costs for items with low demand variability. [SEP] But most important, it must have a managerial system capable of coordinating these elements on an ongoing basis. [SEP] Based on our observations of apparel suppliers,	coming	up with the money for new technologies and practices seems to be less of an impediment than altering basic management conceptions about using these technologies for planning and production. [SEP] Many of the business units in our sample have adopted specific practices without changing their approach to using them together to compete in an integrated channel. [SEP] They continue to draw on traditional conceptions of planning, production, and sourcing—in other words, they still think in terms of large orders of their products, placed months before delivery is expected. [SEP] Needless to say, these business units have not fully benefited from the investments they have made. [SEP] Suppliers in most consumer industries now face lean retailing pressures or its equivalent. [SEP] Many are taking st	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch14.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
the game with lean retailers. [SEP] But even if lean retailing has led to suppliers’ wide-scale adoption of bar codes and EDI-related capabilities, divergent production strategies among suppliers have emerged. [SEP] Conceivably, two business units could each meet the same lean retailing requirements yet have very different internal practices and performance. [SEP] One could raise finished goods inventories substantially (like the dress-shirt manufacturer described above); the other could make crucial operational changes to reduce manufacturing lead times. [SEP] However, in light of the growth of rapid replenishment, our research predicts that the performance of these two units will vary over time, with the supplier that has implemented flexible planning and short-cycle production processes	coming	out ahead. [SEP] By investing in these practices, apparel suppliers have the potential to satisfy lean retailing performance standards without bearing the costs of greatly expanded inventory in their own operations. [SEP] From our standpoint, holding high inventories to meet rapid replenishment demands is strictly a short-term strategy for manufacturers. [SEP] The increasing emphasis on rapid replenishment raises a related question: can offshore manufacturers meet retailers’ requirements for such short delivery lead times and so many services? [SEP] More specifically, what are the characteristics of products for which inexpensive, long lead-time production is preferable to more costly production with extremely short lead times?

[SEP] Hannah’s full-time waitressing soon became both an obstacle and an excuse for lack of progress in her studies. [SEP] “I was at sea,” Hannah recalled.

It didn’t matter what we were doing—birthday celebrations, dinner with friends, outings to movies and plays, shopping excursions, or leisurely breakfasts; Hannah hungered to be part of our family.

Patricia Preciado Martin, born and raised in Arizona, has written extensively about the folklore and traditional past of the Mexican people of Arizona. [SEP] She has collected oral histories and folktales from elderly Mexican Americans, many of them born in Arizona or Sonora, Mexico. [SEP] These oral histories nostalgically narrate the lives of men and women born at the turn of the century, describing the rural way of life on cattle ranches and the early city life of Tucson. [SEP] Thomas Sheridan has written a social history of the Mexican people of Tucson from 1854 to 1941, thoughtfully showing the social and cultural changes that occurred to the Tucsonenses after the	coming	of the Anglo Americans. [SEP] The religious and cultural life of the community is carefully researched and impartially presented. [SEP] A very good description of the foods prepared by Tucson’s Mexican restaurants is provided in the work of Suzanne Myal. [SEP] An early publication of Arizona folklore is a collection of songs published in 1946 titled Canciones de Mi Padre, by Luisa Espinel. [SEP] An exhibit at the University of Arizona Museum of Art reviewed by Amy Kitchener shows the continuity between home and community folk arts. [SEP] A recent article by Josiah Heyman presents a social history of Douglas, Arizona, presented through the oral histories of residents of that city during the first decades of the twentieth century.

Aztlán takes a prominent place in murals, folk art, and folklore, and it continues to appear in Chicano literature today, as it has for over thirty years, in poetry, short stories, novels, and essay anthologies. [SEP] The title of one of Rudolfo Anaya’s novels is Heart of Aztlán, published in 1979; Miguel Mendez wrote Pilgrims in Aztlán first in Spanish in 1974, later translated to English in 1992; and Alurista has a poetry collection titled Floricanto en Aztlán, published in 1971. [SEP] Aztlán is the Chicano homeland, especially for those	coming	of age during the 1960s and 1970s, who wanted to create a cultural space that they could call their own. [SEP] For Chicanos born in the United States, Mexico is not home, but neither is the United States, so Aztlán is looked upon as the mythical homeland. [SEP] The affiliation with Aztlán also reaffirms the Chicanos’ identity as mestizos (people of mixed ancestry), as members of the indigenous population of the New World. [SEP] Chicano writers explore the various meanings of Aztlán in an anthology edited by Rudolfo Anaya and Francisco Lomelí titled Aztlán: Essays on the Chicano Homeland.

[SEP] Limón and Herrera-Sobek discuss versions of the tale circulating in nightclubs and discotheques among urbanized young people. [SEP] Of course, not everyone believes such stories.

d Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). [SEP] Many Chicanos of the Southwest and Midwest are descendants of braceros who came to the United States and stayed, never returning to Mexico. [SEP] The bracero experience has been written about in novels and depicted in numerous movies, and although the image presented is often a negative one, like other Chicano folk heroes the bracero has become an archetype of the culture. [SEP] He is in the company of the historical mestizo character of Yo soy Joaquín, the revolutionary figure of Joaquín Murrieta, the mythical pachuco, the stately learned persona of Dr. Paredes, the gentle leadership of César Chávez; the bracero is the universally exploited farmworker, the campesino of the world. [SEP] Many corridos (ballads) describe the experience of	coming	to work in the agricultural fields of the Midwest and the Southwest. [SEP] Maria Herrera-Sobek -describes the prototype of the bracero, as represented in countless corridos, in her book The Bracero Experience. [SEP] In Mexico the experience was written about from the perspective of those who returned, as in such books as Aventuras de un Bracero, by Jesus Amaya Topete, published in 1949 and reprinted several times, and in the United States the novel Macho! by Edmund Villaseñor, published in 1973.

[SEP] Glimpses of customs, games, dances, theater, and other traditions can be found in the writings of early western travelers, although these were often depicted prejudicially and with a lack of historical context. [SEP] Spanish-language newspapers from the late nineteenth century exhibit folk customs and traditions. [SEP] The folklore collected from Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the twentieth century, even if it’s from a third- or fourth-generation Chicano, generally will be folklore from Mexico transplanted to California since the turn of the century by immigrants fleeing a revolutionary war, or those	coming	to work in the agriculture fields. [SEP] Of course it could also originate in New Mexico or Texas, since there has been much migration into California by Chicanos from those states. [SEP] Folktales, jests, folk songs, corridos (ballads), and customs related to religious and secular holidays, foods, and other folk traditions found in contemporary California will have a lot in common with those found in other southwestern states and with Mexico.

litos, luminarias are small bonfires, and the custom of lighting them dates back to the Roman history of Spain. [SEP] These small fires are built in New Mexico to celebrate La Noche Buena, Christmas Eve, and to light the way for the announcement of the birth of the Christ child. [SEP] One family may light three luminarias in front of their home, one each for Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, while another may light twelve, one for each of the twelve apostles. [SEP] It is believed luminarias originate from the huge bonfires built in pre-Christian times to celebrate rituals to the gods and goddesses. [SEP] Also in ancient times shepherds built fires to keep themselves warm and to scare off the wolves. [SEP] This tradition continued in New Mexico with the shepherds’ fires to illuminate the way for the	coming	of Jesus Christ. [SEP] They are not as well known as farolitos in contemporary American popular culture, and one often finds farolitos mistakenly called luminarias, and magazine articles describe how to make them, especially during the Christmas holidays.

A god, one of the major deities of the Aztecs. [SEP] Quetzal is a Nahuatl word referring to a bird found in Central America, and coatl means “snake,” so Quetzalcoatl means a “feathered serpent,” and this god is often called the Plumed Serpent. [SEP] Stories about him indicate that he was an earthly hero, a light-skinned man, who acted as the ruler of the Toltecs for some time. [SEP] In one legend Quetzalcoatl is sent to the underground to get the bones of the ancients. [SEP] After the end of the Fourth Sun (an Aztec era), when the ancient people have been drowned or changed into fish, the spirits decide he should go seek the bones in order to start a new race. [SEP] He must try three times, over	coming	many obstacles, before he succeeds in bringing the bones to the sky. [SEP] They are ground to a powder and placed in a bowl by the goddess Cihuacoatl. [SEP] The other gods shed blood into the bowl and humans are born. [SEP] Quetzalcoatl discovered corn, which he brought for the new humans to eat. [SEP] He saw an ant bringing a kernel of corn from inside a mountain, and he changed himself into an ant and followed it. [SEP] Lightning was used to split open the mountain to bring the corn to the people. [SEP] He left the Toltecs to return to his home.

 Today, men and women must avoid sexual harassment on the job, even though in this case the “third-party” effect arises not directly from the Constitution but from federal legislation. [SEP] An activist tripartite conception of government requires funding. [SEP] Fighting a major military campaign to suppress the Southern insurrection required a stronger financial base than the government had needed up to that time. [SEP] The war drove up spending from the customary 2 percent of the gross national product to 15 percent. [SEP] (By comparison, in the early 1990s, government spending represented 20 percent of the GNP.)5 With no place left to turn, a Republican Congress approved the first income tax in 1862. [SEP] By 1865, the income tax generated over 20 percent of federal revenue, the balance	coming	from tariffs and reintroduced excise taxes. [SEP] The Civil War income tax lapsed in 1872, and when the direct tax against income returned to the national agenda in the 1890s, the times were different. [SEP] The disputes took on the tones of class struggle. [SEP] This time, it was the Democrats who favored the tax as a measure of social justice. [SEP] Many of the wealthy who were affected by the modest 2 percent tax denounced the measure as socialist. [SEP] Almost immediately after the tax’s introduction, a challenge under the original Constitution made its way to the Supreme Court, where five of the nine justices were convinced that any form of income tax violated the prohibition against direct taxes not in proportion to the census.6 [SEP] Progressive politics as well as the government’s d	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
 toward exploitation. [SEP] The problem is particularly acute when the party seeking sexual favors—usually a man—is in a position of authority over his desired partner. [SEP] The most hotly debated cases are spun from skepticism about whether nominal consent actually generates the kind of voluntary relationship that should be regarded as an expression of freedom rather than of exploitation. [SEP] The same is true of regulation of sexual harassment on the job. [SEP] If the boss promises advancement or threatens disadvantaged treatment on the job, the appearance of complete and voluntary participation is readily undermined. [SEP] So far, in the name of equality, we are willing to tolerate rather intrusive regulation of dating practices in corporate or university settings, but one can sense a	coming	backlash favoring the principle that students old enough to vote should be old enough to make a responsible decision about their sexual lives.13 [SEP] Making it a crime or private action for damages for coworkers or costudents to have sexual relations would surely violate the right to sexual autonomy now recognized as an aspect of liberty protected by the due process clause.14 [SEP] The problem of exploitation in apparently voluntary sexual relations has long been with us. [SEP] In the late nineteenth century, the problem was whether the Mormon practice of polygamy should be regarded as protected as liberty and the free expression of religious conviction.

In 1869, four years after the war was over, the Louisiana legislature passed a statute that brought home the persistence of a dispute about economic freedom that reached back to the earliest stages of modern European and English legal history. [SEP] The great virtue of the case was to remind the legal community that many issues of freedom had nothing at all to do with the war of solidarity to preserve the nation and emancipate the slaves. [SEP] At the time, about one thousand people in New Orleans were engaged in the business of receiving shipments of livestock from boats	coming	down the Mississippi, slaughtering the animals and packing the meat for distribution. [SEP] The 1869 Act claimed to concentrate the management of the livestock and meat packing trade into selected areas. [SEP] It provided that animals could be unloaded and slaughtered exclusively on the properties owned by two of the many enterprises engaged in the trade. [SEP] All the butchers in the area had the right to use these facilities, but they had to pay a prescribed fee to the patented monopoly. [SEP] The ostensible reason for consolidating these activities was “to protect the health of the city of New Orleans.”8 The Act was entitled: “An act to protect the health of the city of New Orleans, to locate the stock-landings and slaughter-houses, and to incorporate the Crescent City Live-Stock Landing	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2

[SEP] Over the past three decades, a sustained eVort has included a wealth of experiments aiming at discovering the abiotic origins of the organic molecules that are the building blocks of known living systems. [SEP] In the summer of 1997, NASA was busy attempting to formulate what it came to call “astrobiology,” an attempt to understand the origin, evolution, and characteristics of life anywhere in the universe. [SEP] Astrobiology does not yet exist = it is a field in the birthing process. [SEP] Whatever the area comes to be called as it matures, it seems likely to be a field of spectacular success and deep importance in the	coming	century. [SEP] A hint of the potential impact of astrobiology came in August 1997 with the tentative but excited reports of a Martian meteorite found in Antarctica that, NASA scientists announced, might have evidence of early Martian microbial life.

[SEP] The vice president began the meeting with a rather unexpected question to the group: If it should prove true that the Martian rock actually harbored fossilized microbial life, what would be the least interesting result?

importance. [SEP] Phage display is now a central part of drug discovery in many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. [SEP] The discovery of “drug leads” is being transformed from a diYcult to a routine task. [SEP] Not only is work being pursued using peptides but also using RNA and DNA sequences. [SEP] Molecular diversity has now spread to the generation of high-diversity libraries of small organic molecules, an approach called “combinatorial chemistry.” [SEP] The promise is of high medical importance. [SEP] As we understand better the genetic diversity of the human population, we can hope to create well-crafted molecules with increased eYcacy as drugs, vaccines, enzymes, and novel molecular structures. [SEP] When the capacity to craft such molecules is married, as it will be in the	coming	decades, to increased understanding of the genetic and cellular signaling pathways by which ontogeny is controlled, we will enter an era of “postgenomic” medicine. [SEP] By learning to control gene regulation and cell signaling, we will begin to control cell proliferation, cell diVerentiation, and tissue regeneration to treat pathologies such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and degenerative diseases. [SEP] But George Smith’s experiments are also of immediate interest, and in surprising ways that will bear on our later discussion of autonomous agents.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
. [SEP] The chemical reaction network occurs under “chemostat” conditions. [SEP] This means that all molecular constituents of the system are treated mathematically as if they were in a real well-stirred container to which the trimers and photons are added at a constant rate. [SEP] In addition, the hexamer molecular components are removed from the system at an adjustable rate that holds their internal concentrations constant whatever the rate of reproduction of hexamer may be. [SEP] The autonomous agent system reproduces more eYciently with the couplings of the DNA trimer-hexamer system to the PP and electron cycles than in the purely exergonic case in which the DNA trimer-hexamer system operates alone. [SEP] We measured eYciency thermodynamically as the conversion of available free energy	coming	into the system from the photon source into the excess hexamer with respect to the undriven steady-state rate of reaction concentration of the hexamer. [SEP] Figure 3.5 shows the results of our simulations. [SEP] In these simulations of the chemical reaction network, there are, as noted, thirteen kinetic constants. [SEP] We carried out computer selection experiments not only comparing the autonomous agent to a nude exergonic DNA trimer-hexamer system, but also computationally mutating the kinetic constants by small amounts and computationally evolving autonomous agents to reproduce with higher thermodynamic eYciency.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
Figure 3.5 shows the results of our simulations. [SEP] In these simulations of the chemical reaction network, there are, as noted, thirteen kinetic constants. [SEP] We carried out computer selection experiments not only comparing the autonomous agent to a nude exergonic DNA trimer-hexamer system, but also computationally mutating the kinetic constants by small amounts and computationally evolving autonomous agents to reproduce with higher thermodynamic eYciency. [SEP] Our results demonstrate first and most important that autonomous agents operating displaced from equilibrium and utilizing a work cycle can be more eYcient at using the available free energy	coming	into the total system in reproducing hexamer DNA than in the absence of the coupling of the trimer-hexamer DNA system to the PP and electron-photon work cycle system. [SEP] Thus, the autonomous agent as a whole, including its work cycle, reproduces DNA hexamer more rapidly than would the trimer-hexamer exergonic system alone. [SEP] In short, and also important, being an autonomous agent coupling an autocatalytic system with a work cycle is of selective advantage compared to being a merely exergonic autocatalytic system. [SEP] Second, just as in the glycolytic positive-feedback case, our autonomous agent model, for appropriate values of the kinetic constants, can undergo sustained temporal oscillations of PP and other concentrations.

ll this come from, this measuring of useful displacements from equilibrium from which work can be extracted, the devices coupling to such measurements, and the extraction of work used to build up new kinds of devices that measure new kinds of displacements from equilibrium to extract work in new ways? [SEP] Yet a biosphere, actually constructing itself up from sunlight, water, and a small diversity of chemical compounds, does all this over evolutionary time. [SEP] The biosphere does achieve persistent measuring of displacements from equilibrium from which work can be extracted and does discover “devices” to couple to those energy sources such that work can be extracted. [SEP] And since the biosphere does this, and the biosphere is part of the universe, then the universe does it. [SEP] This	coming	into existence of self-constructing ecosystems must, somehow, be physics. [SEP] Thus, it is important that we have no theories for these issues in current physics. [SEP] The stark fact that a biosphere builds up this astounding complexity and diversity suggests that our current physics is missing something fundamental. [SEP] A biosphere becomes complex, the universe becomes complex. [SEP] I will argue that the very diversity and complexity of a biosphere begets its further diversification and complexification. [SEP] I strongly suspect that the same is true of the universe as a whole. [SEP] The universe’s very diversity and complexity begets its further diversification and complexification. [SEP] After exploring Maxwell’s demon, I will ask a physicist’s question, What is work? [SEP] Physicis	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
al volume of message space occupied by a given message is “p,” then the logarithm of this volume is “logp” and the probability of that volume is “p.” [SEP] Thus, the logarithm of a probability of a message multiplied by that probability itself is “plogp.” [SEP] The sum of these “plogp” terms for the total set of messages at the source is the entropy of the source. [SEP] Reception of a signal reduces the receiver’s uncertainty about what is being sent from the source, hence is a negative entropy. [SEP] Shannon’s information measure is, thus, just the negative of the normal entropy measure. [SEP] The link established by Szilard between information and Maxwell’s demon is, roughly, that the discrimination by the demon that a given gas molecule is faster or slower than average and whether it is	coming	from the left or right box (hence, whether he should open or close the flap valve) constitutes a measurement that extracts information about the gas system, hence, lowers the uncertainty about the gas system, hence, lowers the entropy of the gas system. [SEP] Importantly, there is an implied observer in discussions about entropy. [SEP] Thus, a physicist might typically say that the entropy of a system is due to “our coarse graining” of the system into (arbitrarily) chosen macrostates. [SEP] If “we” had more information about the microscopic states of the system, our more refined coarse graining would reduce the entropy of the system from our point of view. [SEP] Indeed, there has been some genuine confusion about the role of the observer and his more or less arbitrary choice of coarse grain	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
But this is an essential issue. [SEP] Only certain features of a nonequilibrium system will, upon measurement, reveal a displacement from equilibrium that can actually be used to extract work. [SEP] Other features, if measured, are useless with respect to revealing a displacement from equilibrium that can be used to extract work by any given specific system. [SEP] It is important to stress that we have here a sense of “useful” outside the context of autonomous agents. [SEP] Useful measurements detect features of displacements from equilibrium that reveal energy sources from which work can be extracted. [SEP] Only some measurements are actually useful in this sense in a biosphere, a geosphere, or a galaxy. [SEP] These useful measurements participate together with the	coming	into existence of devices that extract work used to build further measurement and work extraction structures, in the gradual buildup of the diversity of structures and processes of a biosphere, a geosphere, a galaxy, or a universe. [SEP] This buildup is part of why the universe is complex. [SEP] I believe that we can ultimately create a statistical theory of the probability of the generation of specific novel processes, structures, and energy sources; propagation of measurements; detection of useful sources of energy; and couplings of structures and processes to the energy sources to extract work and progressively build up still further new structures, energy sources, and processes  all as a function of the current diversity of structures, transformation processes, and measuring and couplin	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
Fine, but we built the tiny windmill. [SEP] How do such coupling structures that link identified sources of energy to the carrying out of work come to exist in the universe on their own? [SEP] There is not the slightest doubt, for example, that such entities have come into existence in our biosphere as autonomous agents have coevolved over the eons. [SEP] Thus, a host of new questions are raised. [SEP] In the beginning, presumably, the universe was simple, homogeneous, featureless, almost isotropic. [SEP] Now it is vastly complex. [SEP] In the beginning, the early Earth had a paucity of complex molecules, chemical reactions, linked structures and processes. [SEP] Now it is vastly complex. [SEP] The universe as a whole has witnessed the	coming	into existence of novel structures and processes; so too has the biosphere. [SEP] Where no dierence existed, dierences have come into existence. [SEP] In a general sense, the persistent emergence of dierent structures and processes is the persistent breaking of the symmetry of the universe. [SEP] What feeds this apparent propagating diversity? [SEP] One aspect may be the following. [SEP] Consider again the case of the box with the flap valve and something simpler than a fan, say a small mica flake suspended in the cooler of the left and right boxes. [SEP] If the flap valve “be opened,” a wind from the hotter to the cooler box is transiently present. [SEP] This is a simple displacement from equilibrium, and a simple device, the mica flake, will be made to quake, hence, extract mechanical wor	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
oupled web of chemical reactions among simple, complex, and very complex organic molecules, ranging from carbon dioxide to proteins comprised of thousands of amino acids. [SEP] The catalytic sites of enzymes possess high stereospecificity  that is, shape specificity  for the transition state of the substrate(s) of the reaction. [SEP] Such reactions may release energy or may couple the release of energy to the endergonic synthesis of other molecular species. [SEP] Cells are replete with equally stunning receptor complexes decorating their surfaces. [SEP] Binding a ligand to a receptor may trigger a complicated sequence of reactions leading to the synthesis of hundreds of dierent molecular species. [SEP] But the high specificity of molecular interactions in a cell are precise examples of the	coming	into existence of richly nuanced, structurally and procedurally complex molecular processes that measure and detect sources of energy, and couple those sources to the carrying out of further chemical, electrical, or mechanical work. [SEP] A coevolving biosphere achieves exactly the emergence of such self-constructing diversifying organization. [SEP] Whether galaxies, planetary, stellar, or other systems do as well is an open question. [SEP] Again, one senses the possibility of a statistical theory of the propagation and self-elaboration of such linked structure transformational systems.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
osition with such and such velocity. [SEP] Now, given Newton’s calculus, let us compute the forward trajectory of the balls on the table. [SEP] So the puzzle of where the initial and boundary conditions come from, and the specific coupling of cue to ball, are “hidden” in the initial and boundary conditions of “the problem” and in how Newton taught us to calculate. [SEP] In short, the problem of the organization of the process in any specific case of work is hidden from view in the initial and boundary conditions of the usual statement of the physical problem. [SEP] In eect, this choice is the choice of the “relevant” degrees of freedom, which is equivalent to the choice of the boundary conditions versus the dynamical variables of the system. [SEP] But an evolving biosphere is all about the	coming	into existence in the universe of the complex, diversifying ever-changing initial and boundary conditions that constitute coevolving autonomous agents, with their changing organization of capacities to measure and detect energy sources, and couple those detected energy sources to systems that sometimes extract work. [SEP] We will return in a subsequent chapter to ask if it makes sense to try to finitely prestate the initial and boundary conditions of a biosphere. [SEP] I will claim that it does not. [SEP] I will claim that we cannot finitely prespecify the configuration space of a biosphere, hence, we cannot finitely prespecify the initial and boundary conditions of a biosphere.

A Physics of Semantics? [SEP] ach of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory. [SEP] Each is tentative and incomplete, pointing but not fully adequate. [SEP] Yet, I persistently hope, it is better to light one candle against   .    [SEP] .   .   what? the darkness? the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before? There are grounds, reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries, to doubt a physics of semantics. We are on shaky ground. Yet when the first hard frost comes, when the birches have been swung, their crimson leaves scattered carelessly, when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the	coming	dawn, long-legged, knowing how winter is thin, when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams, small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where, perhaps, something new is to be found. We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent, able to manipulate the universe on its own behalf  the egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady, powerful flight. The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom, and perhaps more than the vaunted quark. But autonomous agents, we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf, we to whom “intentionality” and “purpose” are so inevitably attributed by our common languages, we are, by my definition of autonomous agents, also nothing but physi	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
I cannot buy Shannon’s view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent.

ented actions of agents in their worlds. [SEP] Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing. [SEP] I too know the risks, including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from “intentional talk” to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question. [SEP] But patience. [SEP] Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold, but we also cannot even translate  in the sense of necessary and sucient conditions  from legal talk to normal intentional talk, let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound-wave forms monitored and masses at space-time lines as a description. [SEP] Then let’s just be naive for the moment. [SEP] The semantics of the yuck or yum	coming	into a simple autonomous agent  say, an early bacterium  is somehow linked with the embodied know-how of that agent in making a living, or failing to make a living, in its world. [SEP] The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered, context-dependent set of causal implications of the event, or signal, in question. [SEP] “For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of the shoe, the horse was lost; and for want of the horse, the rider was lost,” more or less, said Benjamin Franklin. [SEP] The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
roadsides than wagon wheels. [SEP] The car has replaced the Conestoga. [SEP] I distrust a reductionism that sees causality as bottom up. [SEP] In what sense is Tomasina nothing but the atoms and their locations and motions in three-dimensional space of which she was comprised? [SEP] The concepts of atoms in motion in three-dimensional space do not appear to entail the concepts of an autonomous agent, self-consistent constraint construction, release of energy, propagating work tasks, and the closure of catalysis, tasks, and other features that constitutes the propagating organization that is an autonomous agent or a coevolving ecology of autonomous agents. [SEP] In one sense, of course, there is nothing but the atoms in motion in three-dimensional-space in Tomasina. [SEP] But the historical	coming	into existence of life in the universe, of autonomous agents, and of the propagating organization that is Tomasina and her bioworld is nowhere accounted for by Newton’s laws. [SEP] What, after all, do Newton’s laws of motion have to do with a suYcient account of Tomasina’s jump to the left rather than the right?

[SEP] Selection tunes communities of cells to the phase transition between order and chaos where a power law distribution of damage avalanches on all scales propagate across the system. [SEP] The claims	coming	next are not my own work, but derive from fine eorts by ecologists Stuart Pimm, Mack Post, and more recently, Bruce Sawhill and Tim Keitt, making use of work by physicist Scott Kirkpatrick and his colleagues. [SEP] First, the early work of Stuart Pimm and Mack Post, done in the late s: They were concerned with community assembly of organisms into a local ecosystem (Figure .). [SEP] They ignored long-term coevolution and made use of the Lotka-Volterra equations. [SEP] These equations basically say, for any species, what other species it eats, how readily it turns the eaten prey into an extra copy of itself, and how fast it reproduces on its own without eating. [SEP] Plants, herbivores, and carnivores are readily represented.	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
Moreover, general competitive equilibrium, seen as a culmination of one central strand of economic theory, is too limited. [SEP] Insofar as economics is concerned with understanding the establishment of prices at which markets clear, general competitive equilibrium was a masterpiece. [SEP] But insofar as economics is or should be concerned with how and why economies increase the diversity of goods and services, the reigning theory is a nonstarter. [SEP] And since the growth in wealth per capita over the past million years is deeply related to the growth in the diversity of technology and goods and services, contemporary economics is clearly inadequate. [SEP] We need a theory of the persistent	coming	into existence of new goods and services and extinction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. [SEP] In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. [SEP] We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. [SEP] We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. [SEP] And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera. [SEP] But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events.

[SEP] The economy, like the biosphere, is about persistent creativity in ways of making a living. [SEP] I find it intriguing to note certain parallels from our prior discussion of autonomous agents and propagating organization. [SEP] At the level of molecular autonomous agents, I made the point repeatedly that work is the constrained release of energy and that autonomous agents do carry out work to construct the constraints on the release of energy such that the energy is released along specific channels and such that specific coupli	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2

Olhão’s fishing port is worth a look. [SEP] The fishermen of the town have a reputation for hardiness — some used to earn a living in cod waters as far off as Newfoundland. [SEP] During the past two centuries, however, some of the sailors have turned away from fishing and instead, taken to the cargo trade between Portugal and North Africa. [SEP] This relatively recent link with the neighboring continent may have been the inspiration for the local North African style of architecture. [SEP] In any case, it developed long after the Moors had left the Algarve. [SEP] You’re unlikely to see a boat	coming	in from another continent, but you are guaranteed the hustle, bustle, sights, smells, and sounds of one of the Olhão fish market, one of the Algarve’s best (the town is especially famous for its mussels and other shellfish). [SEP] Adjacent to the voluminous market buildings are small, well-tended parks, one of which boasts several splendid benches decorated with blue-and-white azulejos. [SEP] Just beyond the park on the other side, ferryboats depart regularly in summer for the barrier-island beaches of Armona and Culatra just offshore. [SEP] These lovely, undeveloped beaches are the jewels of the coastline between Faro and Tavira. [SEP] A little farther along the coast, at Fuzeta, is another popular beach.

 perfectly enchanting little whitewashed village overlooking the sea. [SEP] Pretty Cacela Velha can’t have more than 100 inhabitants. [SEP] It has an 18th-century church, a telephone booth, a cemetery, an old well, and a handful of well-tended, blue-and-white houses festooned with flowers. [SEP] Below the town, along a spit of sand that’s part of the Ria (estuary), are a few moored fishing boats. [SEP] East of here lies the fledgling resort of Manta Rota, a former fishing village, and the high-rise canyons of Monte Gordo. [SEP] The reason behind all this development is a long sandy beach, which stretches undisturbed for some 10 km (6 miles) between the two resorts and is backed by pine trees and dunes. [SEP] Although the last in a long line of Algarve beach resorts (or the first, if you’re	coming	from Spain) is not, by a long shot, the coast’s most attractive, the beach and watersports facilities at Monte Gordo are enough to attract and entertain many serious sun-seekers. [SEP] By night the casino is the focus of attention. [SEP] The Guadiana River, which runs into the Atlantic 3 km (2 miles) east of Monte Gordo, served as a natural frontier for 2,000 years, forming the boundary between the Roman provinces of Lusitania (Portugal) and Baetica (southern Spain). [SEP] This explains the strategic importance of Castro Marim, a former fortress town rising from the flatlands to command the broad river.

[SEP] The pretty Byzantine church (c1080) has a stone-and-tile dome exterior but is famed throughout Greece for the fantastic mosaics that decorate the interior, particularly that of Christ Pantocrator in the main dome. [SEP] Through this same industrial area runs the Sacred Way that linked Athens with the city of Eleusis. [SEP] In ancient times the way was lined with shrines and tombs, which are now and again brought to light when redevelopment takes place. [SEP] Eleusis was home to the Sanctuary of Demeter and the Eleusian Mysteries — a series of complex and enigmatic rituals only performed by initiates of the order. [SEP] The order thrived from the Mycenaean era to the	coming	of Christianity. [SEP] Annual celebrations to Demeter took place in Athens each September, with a public festival and a secret religious rite that transformed chosen followers into initiates of the secrets. [SEP] A procession would leave Eleusis and walk along the Sacred Way entering Athens via the Sacred Gate at Kerameikos (see page 49) before proceeding to the Acropolis. [SEP] In Eleusis the sacred way led directly to the Sanctuary of Demeter and a large Temple of Artemis with a forecourt where the initiates would gather in preparation for the procession. [SEP] A great Propylaia marked the entrance to the town  — a copy of that at the Acropolis.

[SEP] Take a ride through the human body, or dash around the world in an afternoon as you step into re-creations of 11 countries.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
Goa Lawah Considered one of Bali’s oddities, the Bat Cave and its temple are hemmed in by souvenir stalls, hawkers, sash dispensers, donation collectors, ticket sellers, and, for most of the day, parked tour buses. [SEP] Once past this obstacle course, you’ll see the cave mouth and a seething mass of leathery bats clinging to the rock face, here and there dropping off, circling and then	coming	in to land again. [SEP] They can’t all find a place in the cave, so some hang outside in broad daylight. [SEP] If you are staying anywhere near, perhaps at Candi Dasa, you might time a visit here for dusk. [SEP] That’s when the bat colony pours out of the cave like a liquid black stream and wheels away into the distance to feed on the myriad insects of the tropical night. [SEP] On the foreshore near the Bat Cave, a few people scratch a living by harvesting salt. [SEP] Seawater is first concentrated by solar evaporation in shallow pans and then transferred to the hollowed-out halves of palm tree trunks to crystallize.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
Museums and Excursions After 1945, many works originally in the eastern half of the city or Potsdam were transferred to a new home in the west. [SEP] After reunification, Berlin’s museums were again in a state of flux, but this situation is now	coming	to an end as collections settle into their permanent homes. [SEP] Berlin has a huge number of museums, but luckily most of them are arranged in convenient groups. [SEP] Museums are superbly laid out, and most provide leaflets (usually in German, but often in English and French) with detailed information about the exhibits; you will find honesty boxes for payment freely dotted about. [SEP] For addresses and opening hours, see pages 66–67.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
ive around the Hollywood Hills for a superb view of the city. [SEP] The classic Los Angeles cruise is along Mulholland Drive. [SEP] On a clear day you can see Long Beach, 25-miles (40-km) away across the vast, sprawling metropolis. [SEP] Another great viewpoint is the Observatory in Griffith Park (off Highway 5). [SEP] Fans of James Dean will recognize the Observatory — it was the scene of the climax of Rebel Without a Cause. [SEP] The panorama from the terrace on a clear day is fantastic, from the spiky skyscrapers of downtown to the distant Pacific. [SEP] Griffith Park is the biggest city park in the United States. [SEP] It sprawls across the eastern Hollywood Hills and is criss-crossed with drives and hiking trails. [SEP] Toward sunset is the best time to go, just as the city lights are	coming	on.

way that founder John Simcoe thrust north from the fort to Lake Simcoe, starts out now as downtown Toronto’s main commercial artery. [SEP] Its intersection at the elegant shopping thoroughfare, Bloor Street, is the fashionable hub of the city. [SEP] Following John Simcoe’s military grid pattern, Toronto’s main arteries run from the lakefront north: Spadina and University Avenues, Bay, Yonge, and Church Streets; and east–west: Front, King, Queen, Dundas, College-Carlton, and Bloor Streets. [SEP] Our sightseeing itinerary starts down at the waterfront and works north through the business district to the chic shopping and museum area. [SEP] As an alternative, especially if you have children, you may prefer to start downtown, around Union Station, and visit the other sights to the north before	coming	back to relax among the recreational attractions of the waterfront. [SEP] Getting around the city is quite simple, but while downtown, park your car and walk or use the buses or subway.

The Central Area There are several approaches to Las Cañadas National Park and Mount Teide. [SEP] The park is well sign-posted from the road via La Orotava, but if you are	coming	from the north, then the most picturesque route is via La Esperanza. [SEP] The small town soon gives way to a lush forest of giant pines and eucalyptus trees. [SEP] Four km (21⁄2 miles) south at Las Raíces is where Franco met with his co-conspirators in 1936 (see page 20). [SEP] An obelisk in the forest commemorates the event. [SEP] As the road gains altitude and temperatures fall, the views become ever more spectacular. [SEP] The Mirador Pico de las Flores looks out over to the southeast and the Mirador de Ortuño offers a panorama of the northern coast. [SEP] Highest of all at over 2,000 m (6,562 ft), Mirador las Cumbres reveals Teide in all her glory. [SEP] The entrance to the National Park is El Portillo de las Cañadas, where there is a visitor center (open daily 9am–4pm).

ed their building practices. [SEP] The whole Yucatán peninsula witnessed the flowering of classic Mayan civilization and a society of great sophistication; with its magnificent pyramids, temples, and palaces decorated with wall paintings and carved low-reliefs, a written language of hieroglyphics, and complicated medical procedures to heal the injured or the sick. [SEP] Mayan astronomers tracked the movements of the heavenly bodies, predicting eclipses and marking the times for the planting of the new corn. [SEP] In fact, corn came to symbolize life for the Maya — in their myths of creation, mankind was formed from lumps of maize dough. [SEP] Elaborate rituals grew up around the preparation of the milpas (cornfields) and the planting and harvesting of the crop whose success depended on the	coming	of the annual rains. [SEP] These rituals were undertaken by a small number of initiates who controlled the knowledge of the Maya. [SEP] Because the region has no surface rivers, rain was a precious resource and the Maya saw any stock of water, such as the limestone water holes or cenotes, as holy places. [SEP] The rain god Chaac was a very important deity, whose image can be seen at every Mayan site. [SEP] But there was a dark side to this sophisticated society. [SEP] The Maya viewed their gods not as benevolent guides but as changeable spirits in need of constant appeasement. [SEP] To incur the wrath of the gods would result in drought, a loss of crops, and certain starvation. [SEP] To keep the gods happy, the people offered sacrifices at their great pyramid temples. [SEP] The ceremonies w	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
alism. [SEP] Changes came in quick succession in the 1970s. [SEP] The US president, Richard Nixon, visited China in 1972, thus normalizing relations between the two countries. [SEP] In early 1976 the widely admired prime minister, Zhou Enlai, died. [SEP] Eight months later, in September, death came to Chairman Mao himself. [SEP] Mao’s widow, the one-time film actress Jiangqing, and her close associates (the so-called Gang of Four) were arrested, tried, and imprisoned for encouraging the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. [SEP] Thousands who had suffered during the fervid 1960s and 1970s, including the forceful pragmatist Deng Xiaoping, were rehabilitated. [SEP] At the same time as Mao Zedong’s portraits and slogans were being removed from billboards and schoolrooms, a new flexibility was	coming	to the fore. [SEP] Top priority was now assigned to the modernization of China’s underdeveloped economy. [SEP] This opened the way for major scientific and commercial exchanges with the West. [SEP] And foreign tourists soon began flooding into the country to see the splendors that had been inaccessible for so long. [SEP] In 1992 “Supreme Leader” Deng Xiaoping set into motion a rapid Westernization of China’s economy. [SEP] Deng’s death and Hong Kong’s return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 together marked another new era in the creation of a New China, this time as an economic superpower designed to rival the US and Europe in the 21st century.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-History.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
ferry visitors from Leshan to the site of the Great Buddha (Dafo). [SEP] Whether seen from the river or, later, from the hillsides, the world’s largest seated Buddha is an impressive spectacle. [SEP] Carved from the cliffside by a monk starting in the year 713, its height is 71 m (233 ft). [SEP] The statue’s feet are so big that a hundred people can sit on each instep. [SEP] The boats tie up some distance from the Buddha and passengers climb from the shore to Dark Green Temple (Wuyousi), with its view of Mt. Emei, the gate to Western Paradise. [SEP] A pathway and suspension bridge lead back to the Great Buddha. [SEP] There, the Stairs of Nine Turnings wind steeply down one side of the statue to the feet. [SEP] Another honeycombed stairway carved from the cliff leads back up the other side,	coming	out level with Buddha’s massive crown, where you have a view of the Buddha’s serene and knowing countenance. [SEP] More temples and caves lie on the road back to the boat landing and the buses to the sacred peak. [SEP] Mt. Emei	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
arreos, might be your Caribbean paradise — if all you’re looking for is a dazzling white beach and clear blue seas. [SEP] Other than the miles of beaches, there’s not much else of consequence here except mangrove, scrub, and half a dozen comfortable hotels with a full program of entertainment and watersports. [SEP] Turtles nest in the sand at one end of the island. [SEP] At the other you can go sailing, diving, or deep-sea fishing or take a boat trip to Playa Sirena, an incomparable strip of sand a 10-minute boat ride away, where lobster lunches are available. [SEP] Cayo Largo, with its captive tourist audience, is considerably more expensive than the mainland. [SEP] Some package tourists spend the whole of their holiday on Cayo Largo. [SEP] Those with low boredom thresholds might consider	coming	for only a daytrip or for overnight trips on half-hour flights from Havana and Varadero. [SEP] The Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Youth) is Cuba’s largest offshore island, some 50 km (31 miles) in diameter, but not its prettiest. [SEP] It is said to have been the location for Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island; pirates once buried their booty here. [SEP] The island received its jaunty name in the 1970s, when as many as 22,000 foreign students (mainly from politically sympathetic African countries) studied here in no fewer than 60 schools.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
Boudhanath has attracted Tibetan monks and pilgrims for centuries, and over the years a Tibetan and Sherpa community has grown in this area. [SEP] Many of the people you will see circumambulating Boudhanath are Tibetans rather than Nepalis, and those with long braids and wild costumes are usually Tibetans who have only recently arrived in Kathmandu. [SEP] Also keep an eye out for pilgrims who prostrate themselves repeatedly as they circle the stupa. [SEP] Where Swayambhunath is cluttered with monuments in different styles, at Boudhanath there are no other temples to distract pilgrims. [SEP] There are, however, dozens of shops specializing in Tibetan antiques and other Tibetan souvenirs. [SEP] Pilgrims	coming	from Tibet, as well as local refugees, supply the shops that ring the stupa with the city’s best selection of Tibetan antiques. [SEP] There are also shops filled with bronze Buddhist statuary, silver ornaments, prayer wheels, and brass “singing bowls.” [SEP] Patan (Lalitpur)	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
Musée de l’Orangerie A pavilion in the corner of the Jardins des Tuileries is home to the outstanding Walther-Guillaume Collection and Monet’s renowned Nymphéas (Water Lilies). [SEP] Masterpieces by Cézanne, Renoir, Utrillo, Rousseau, Modigliani, Picasso, Derain, and Soutine hang in the upstairs rooms. [SEP] For his great Nymphéas murals, Monet himself chose the two ground-level oval rooms as those most likely to recapture the experience of	coming	across the water lily ponds at his home in Giverny (see page 76).

st south of the small town of Aguada, is a monument commemorating the landing of Cristóbal Colón on the island in 1493. [SEP] Though no one is really sure of the precise landing site (Columbus is renowned for having been less than accurate in documenting his landing sites), the small park with its column and naïve paintings depicting Spanish colonization serves its purpose well. [SEP] North of the town of Aguadilla, traveling out toward the airport and Rafael Hernandez air force base, are a series of fine bathing and surfing beaches. [SEP] The most famous is Crash Boat Beach, named after a shipwreck that happened just offshore. [SEP] The beach is always busy, but the most exciting stretch is the northern section, where the fishing boats rest. [SEP] Most hours of the morning there are ships	coming	ashore with their meager, but extremely fresh, catch. [SEP] The boats are brightly colored and carefully tended to ensure that they are always in peak condition — not one is splintered or sun-bleached. [SEP] Traveling back along the northern coast there is little to draw the eye. [SEP] Inland however, it’s a different story. [SEP] South of the busy town of Arecibo are a number of attractions that would make a fine day-trip from San Juan (none is more than a 90-minute drive from the capital).	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
Ixtapa also has its share of trendy shops and boutiques, plus lively nightlife, and refined dining. [SEP] A bicycle track begins at the marina, continues around the golf course, and heads on towards the northern beach of Playa Linda. [SEP] The first beach in Ixtapa,	coming	from Zihua is Playa Hermosa, which can only be accessed through the Westin Hotel. [SEP] This small beach is dramatically framed by rock formations. [SEP] The surf varies seasonally from minimal to quite rough, and has become somewhat of a private beach for Westin’s guests. [SEP] Playa Linda is located 12km (8 miles) north of Ixtapa. [SEP] This is a long beach with golden sands that seem to stretch endlessly to the north. [SEP] It is the primary out-of-town beach, with water sports equipment rentals, fishing charters, and horseback riding. [SEP] The ferry to Isla Ixtapa leaves from the jetty located on the southern end of Playa Linda.	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt	come	written	OANC_written	2
