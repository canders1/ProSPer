Nothing more.<n>Actually, I went back to see my doctor and when I, everything you know was fine.<n>Nothing, you know, nothing more to do.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdamsElissa.txt

That was the first time I saw them, the gue, the guerillas.<n>Then they went on, they didn't make it to the house.<n>At about, about three weeks later, then arrived a group of about four, at my brother's house, and told him, that they were coming to, to be, that is to take control of the place, where we lived.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
But if we didn't want to work with them, we shouldn't get them into anything with the mil, military, such as, informing on them, or something like that.<n>So, time went on.<n>Then when, well, since I lived alone, only with my son, they, would seek me out because, I always had, everything, because I had all kinds of animals, including doves from Castile, uh, turkeys, ducks, hens, pigs, cows, all kinds of animals.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
And that's how, I kept on, working and, with them.<n>They there, well, they'd come from time to time to buy things, until one day, well, they already had been there for several years, when, all of a sudden along came a young fellow who went around with them whose name was Jose, they call him "Chepon" because he was tall, white, and all.<n>So, he, he came looking for, yogurt, I don't know what he came looking for, for me to sell him.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
I said, "No, I'm not going to tell them."<n>So, the next day, I left early in the morning for San Miguel, to see my daughter, and when I was coming back, I went by my brother's, which was a place in, a town called Chapeltique, and I arrived at his place, and I said, his name is Salomon, and I said, "Brother, I am here to see if you'll give me posada (lodging)," we call it, like you give someone a place to live in your own house.<n>And he said, "What's going on?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
"Yes," I says.<n>That same while that I was there at my brother's, we went to look for, the people who owned land, to see if they would give me, pasture land for the animals.<n>And, yes, they gave me some, and I left.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
And, yes, they gave me some, and I left.<n>It was getting, I got there late, like at, six in the afternoon, I got home, and after I waited for it to get dark, I went to my neighbor's.<n>My neighbor had about four, five grown boys.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
So he said, "OK, that's fine."<n>And, the same way I went out to another, er, e, cousin, his name is Cristobal, and I said, "Cristobal, do you have to, what are you doing tomorrow?"<n>"Nothing," he said, "Why?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
And that's the way it as, how I kept working there.<n>After I worked there, then, that, I went to, San Miguel, because my daughter, also, had, she needed me.<n>And, I kept on, and finally when I saw that life was really expensive, and I didn't have, I couldn't work anymore since I'm not a professional, then I decided to come (to the US), because also, well, the, there in that area, since now there wasn't anywhere to work, I had left hidden from the guerrillas, and, well, that's what I continued.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
And, I kept on, and finally when I saw that life was really expensive, and I didn't have, I couldn't work anymore since I'm not a professional, then I decided to come (to the US), because also, well, the, there in that area, since now there wasn't anywhere to work, I had left hidden from the guerrillas, and, well, that's what I continued.<n>Well, and I forgot to tell you when the soldiers came, to my house, the guerrillas were there, the guerrillas went back.<n>They hid and, the soldiers came to the house.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt

she said, "so I'm going."<n>So, I came in, from where I was washing, I went in, and I didn't see what the guerrillas did with themselves, because I didn't see, they were in front, but since I went it, I didn't see.<n>Then, you know, that in order to keep yourself out of trouble, you go in and don't, then they come, or, that was another time, that I suffered a terrible threat when the soldiers come through.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
And he said, "Ma'am," he said, "what did the guerrillas that were there eating do with themselves?"<n>I said, "Sir, I've gone in, and I don't know, the house is big, and I went inside," I told him, "I haven't seen anyone."<n>He says, "Look, ma'am," he says, "you deserve to have your tongue cut out, because you are covering for the guerrillas."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
I said, "The fact, you, I, you can be there," I said, "or I can stay here and you go in," I said, "you don't see where I get off to."<n>Then they left, they left for the mountain, they went on up.<n>Then a huge throng of soldiers came, and they shot over the house, that, we have to, my dad always used to have a lot of, we call them cercos , of, of pure ijiote of, of, made of poles that are nice and fresh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt

She was kind of confused of what background she wanted to u-, what ethnic background she wanted to use, so she decided to use her black heritage, um background.<n>And so she moved to New York and she went to school there, she made it through school and she did become a attorney.<n>She later was going through problems because they found out that she was a black ethnic and not white, so they would, she could no longer work with the firm.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HicksDebra.txt

One time we lived down in Brooklyn and Miss Sara and she taking care and she did laundry for these millionaires out there on, uh, I can't call the place now, but anyway and she'd come then she'd get Aunt Winnie and several people to help her, you know, do the washing and ironing.<n>And one day then, I, I think we didn't have to go to school or something, but I went down and, Miss Wheeler was her name, she said, "Don't you want to iron a shirt?"<n>"Oh yeah, but you-," I said, "I can't iron."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MillsJanie.txt
The reason I said Louisiana is because that's where I lived all of my life.<n>Everyone went to Vicksburg, Mississippi to have their babies at the Mercy Hospital because we had no facilities in Lake Providence, the most beautiful place on Earth, surrounded by um, lakes, Cyprus trees, good people, right on the banks of the Mississippi.<n>And so when I was born my mom went over there and stayed 10 days in the hospital, with her tummy strapped afterwards because that's the way you did it back in the 30's to assure yourself of a flat tummy when you got home.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MottSara.txt

.<n>We went to Florida on a family vacation one summer.<n>The only vacation, by the way, that my daddy ended up taking us because all the way from Louisiana to<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MottSara.txt
Miami, Florida was almost too much for six people in a car to be together for a 10-day period.<n>But coming home we stopped in New Orleans and my dad had been on a roller coaster in San Francisco and he thought it was such fun and so we went to Pontchartrain Beach in New Orleans and that was nearing the end of the vacation and he said he wanted my brother Fred and me to go for the experience, he thought it was going to be so much fun.<n>So we were all excited about it and got on.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_MottSara.txt
I would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it, was a really big thing to go to the movie on Saturday mornings.<n>And one particular movie theater we went to, they would show serials every Saturday, which were a continued story.<n>So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you, um, wouldn't know what had taken place.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
And there was one other sucker that cost a nickel and we called that an all day sucker, just because you couldn't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long.<n>And one other form of refreshment that we got, which really embarrassed my mother because she didn't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday, there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre.<n>And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
No.<n>So we went out one night to the movie, but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza and then we went to, and I think the name of the place was The Open Kitchen, and we didn't have chain pizza places like we do now, like Pizza Hut and all that.<n>This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go.<n>And we went to Open Kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we didn't have money to leave tips.<n>We would also drink water.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt
Anyway, that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre, and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it's kind of a, pretty much of a spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time.<n>So we bought our tickets and we went into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat, file, all filed in.<n>And I just remember seeing, and I was sitting in a middle section, I was not on an end so I had girls I knew on both sides of me.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_NapierDianne.txt

And, uh, they, they were pretty happy.<n>I mean she went from being fairly wealthy, though, to being poor--<n>Hum.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt

If it doesn't happen I'll, I'll, you know, it can happen at another time I'm sure.<n>We'll be in the same place another time," because minutes went by and nothing happened.<n>So I said to Michaela, after about five or 10 more minutes, "You know, maybe this isn't the right time.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
And I fell in love with Ryan Speckman first, and I said, "Well sure!"<n>So he went and he got him and I walked in that direction, and Mr. Speckman came over and said, "Hi!<n>You must be Ms. Quinn."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
So I said, "Yeah I'll call him."<n>So I went home that night, called him, left him a message, he wasn't there.<n>So a couple of days later, I get home from work again in the evening and there was a message that said, "Call me back, whatever time."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
So, um, Michaela was going out and I had instructions to call her as soon as I got home, to beep her as soon as I got home so we could discuss the date.<n>So we went out to dinner at a place where, Mr. Speckman had asked one of his sons' friends where we should go and he said that's where we should go, and so we went there to eat.<n>And the whole evening was talk, the discussion the whole evening was how all the preparation, and all the discussion that was going on with me and the Quail Girls was also going on with John and with all Ryan's friends.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
But if he asked me out again I'd probably go out again."<n>So this was Friday night, early, so the next day I went out and I bought a Christmas tree and I had a lot of errands to do.<n>In the afternoon Mr. Speckman calls and said, "Really had a good time last night."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
And I said, "Yeah I would too."<n>So we're talking some more, and I said, "I went and got a Christmas tree."<n>He said, "What are you going to do this evening?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
You're going out with him again!"<n>So we went out again and we went out the next Friday and Saturday and the next Friday and Saturday and the next Friday and Saturday, and meanwhile, all the kids at school are in absolute shock that we liked each other and we were going out, I don't know what they expected.<n>And one friend of Ryan's, Brandon said to Michaela one day, "Wouldn't it be weird if your mom and Mr. Speckman got married?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
You never really catch him really laughing he's always really controlled.<n>But he tells a good story with a dry sense of humor, and, uh, golly, he spent his career in the Army still; he just went to Germany.<n>But, uh, those are the two best storytellers I know in our family.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt
That was probably, uh, golly, my dad was born in 1926.<n>So when he was 15 and 16ish, probably the early 40s, as best I can tell from those stories because they both went into the service very late; my dad went into the service at the very end of World War II and my uncle served in Korea.<n>So that would be about right.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt
By the time I was a child, they were well into middle age and were the most incredibly nosy people in this entire town.<n>They went to the same church we went to, First Methodist, and they sat on a certain pew and woe be unto the person who sat, that chose to sit on the Lann twins' pew.<n>They watched everybody's coming and going when we, we kids on the street became teenagers.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StoweCatherine.txt

( ) I hope it come out well.<n>Well, we will tell a story about the, my mother and her sister and my grandfather, grandmother and the other five children went down to Chattanooga, where they had been raised in a place called Sequatchie Valley and my grandfather worked for the railroad.<n>Uh so they had families and friends and they would go back and forth and visit and drive from Charlotte to Chattanooga, TN and back.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt
He had an uncle out in CA, and so he rode his motorcycle from Charlotte, NC up to CA, um, not sure but maybe in Los Angeles area.<n>And there he went in search of his uncle.<n>His uncle had been into some kind of mischief and had been put in jail.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt
Um.<n>He had some other brothers and sisters, and they went to other homes, but when his parents died.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt
they all worked on the farm<n>and he educated his, most of his children, my father went to the seventh grade and quit school.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt
Uh-huh.<n>But his other brothers and sisters went on through school and went to uh, uh college.<n>\\One\\<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt
Uh-huh.<n>He went to the seventh grade and quit, and yet when he, um was older, and in business--<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt
Uh-huh.<n>Where he went to school, although he never graduated<n>, and also the next two higher schools.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt

I'm sure they do ( ) much further back than our ancestors.<n>That's because the, the, you remember, uh, I don't know whether you went to that park or not.<n>That park very small but with a lot of, of handwriting Asian handwriting carved on, on slate too you, \\you didn't go\\ to the park.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ThomasLamar.txt
I heard that story a long time ago, and it is, uh, it has stuck with me.<n>Uh, also another one was uh, "The Raven," the poem "The Raven" uh, that we read in school and uh, we had to determine what it was about, and um, it wasn't easy at first for us to do that, and that, that story or poem went something like this, "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as if some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door, it is some visitor I said only this, and," uh, "nothing more."<n>Of course the story went on for several pages.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt

I can remember uh, some of those stories now, uh, my mother would tell the story of a my uh, great grandmother, my grandmother sitting in the door of living room, when uh, my daddy would go to see her, before they got married and, and of course she would sit there until they leave, and sometimes she would act as though she was sleeping and got rather quiet, she would ( ).<n>In other words, I went to the conclusion that there was strict supervision of, of teenagers uh, while they were under the influence of their parents.<n>Uh,<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt
So, immediately, as soon as possible, rather, I got on the phone and I called over to Justine Morrow School and I got a chance to talk with the director who knew about the uh workings of ( ) Foundations and grants.<n>I went in to conference with them, and I went over to uh, talk with them in person and explain to him what I wanted to do and showed me how I could incorporate the mandates of uh, scholarship that I was trying to get, the fellowship.<n>Uh, and to a study uh, an experience related event.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt
Uh, and to a study uh, an experience related event.<n>So it boiled down and I ended up working on uh the national design of uh, experiences that would help students from small areas make the transition from rural to uh, to larger cities, in eastern NC and of course I based that on the basis of high percentage of individuals who left the area after college and went to larger cities many of them succeeded more than we would like to.<n>I guess basic problems in the transition from uh, small towns and rural areas to uh, the large cities.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt
But I remember when I was in college at A&T State University, W.O. Kerrington speaking uh, and he used for a subject that for every soul open its own way ( ).<n>And he went on to say that high soul chooses the high way, the low soul chooses the low way.<n>And in the midst, is the misty flats which most people choose, and then he went on to talk about the middle road being crowded uh, the low road meeting destruction, and disappointment, tragedy.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt
And he went on to say that high soul chooses the high way, the low soul chooses the low way.<n>And in the midst, is the misty flats which most people choose, and then he went on to talk about the middle road being crowded uh, the low road meeting destruction, and disappointment, tragedy.<n>But, the high road leading to success and opportunities and even then, though we were quite young, he challenged us it seemed to get through that if we selected the high road that benefits had the possibilities of being numerous and sometimes when I'm out alone, when test and trials come, those words come to me,<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt
But, the high road leading to success and opportunities and even then, though we were quite young, he challenged us it seemed to get through that if we selected the high road that benefits had the possibilities of being numerous and sometimes when I'm out alone, when test and trials come, those words come to me,<n>a group of words were uttered by ( ) that we were expected to learn and we were expected and required in high school to learn poems, to read poems and try to interpret poems that we could think of, and one of them was by Kipling, which was "If" and I don't recall all of it now, but it went on to say that "if you can dream and not make your dreams your master, if you can think and not make your thoughts your aim, you can meet with triumph and disaster.<n>Treat those two imposters just the same" and it goes on the say that if you can do all these things, yours is the world and all that is in it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt
We were a loving family.<n>We did a lot of, most things together, worked together, we grew up in a rural area and we worked together, we ate together, we uh, went shopping together.<n>We went to church together and uh, that bonded us to the extent that we have remained relatively close though gone our separate ways to different parts of country uh, because of that early loving and care, and concern.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt

I don't know why I would do that by myself.<n>I went by myself, basically without one, in a tour group and my visit after I got there.<n>I didn't have any problems except uh, when I was getting ready to leave it was in the monsoon season.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt
The teachers lived in the community, primarily; they visited the churches.<n>And sometimes members of the churches that students went to.<n>So, they saw the students in non-academic settings as well as in academic settings.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt
Uh, one final thing that I must mention is religion was more of an important factor in the lives of young people when I was a teenager.<n>Growing up, almost everybody went to church and students went with them and it sure didn't make them perfect, but it seem to uh, place some fear in their minds, some people today I think have no fear, even fear of death.<n>They think they're going to come back, it's some temporary vacation and they don't realize when they use violence or they when they overdose how permanent it is.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WenlyRichard.txt
Yeah, well, and, uh, another interesting word was "picking".<n>I went right into the school system and I was teaching and, um, it was a little awkward at times and the kids were, they would tease, and instead of saying, you know, I'm teasing, they would say-- \\<n>\\ Hello baby!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt
My dad is a very, very special man.<n>He, um, he grew up in WV and he, um, played football when he was in high school and he went right into the service and he was in WWII, he was a medic in the army.<n>And he was over in Europe.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt
And he was over in Europe.<n>In fact, I was just talking to him this last Thanksgiving about some of the things that he went through when he was in the service and, and traveling across the sea on these boats that had flat bottoms and they would go way up in the, in the water and then smack down, you know, it was very rough.<n>They left out of NY and went to Scotland.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt

The ballerina part never came about, but I, I did go on to college and I, um, transferred a lot and ended up going to a lot of different colleges which was kind of fun.<n>I went to Marshall University, and I went to University of Pittsburgh, and I ended up graduating from West Virginia University with a major in printmaking and a minor in art history and English literature.<n>Did you ever visit the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WentzLinda.txt
So I was named after each grandmother and Mama liked "Tammy" and stuck it in the middle.<n>So I had a real long name when I went to school.<n>I was in the first grade before I found out what my whole name was.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt
I'd been writing "Tammy Watkins."<n>I could read and write before I went to school, because Mama had a lot of time to spend with me.<n>My next sister wasn't born until I was like five years old.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt
Rode bikes for a long time until I was a big old girl.<n>And we went into the woods and there was bunch of vines that covered like a blanket.<n>And I'd walk through those vines and it was real shady and cool.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt
I thought it was a whole lot easier to ride that bike than walking.<n>Fixed us a picnic lunch and she brought a book and we went out there.<n>And she still talks about that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt
No that was, um, that was in Huntersville.<n>When Mama left Daddy we went and moved out to Huntersville.<n>Oh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WhiteChristine.txt

So I would go out and see my second cousins, not my first cousins because they were all old people as far as I was concerned.<n>But when I was, I think one of my earliest recollections, was when I was three years old, Mama and Daddy and I went down to, to FL.<n>And I remember, going through the lobby of the hotel where we stayed at with my bathing suit on and with one of those God-awful swim caps that everybody that you see when you look in the 40s movies and it felt like I was in a vacuum when I was walking!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
So, you couldn't cross the street, you couldn't turn in or turn out or anything, it was just really, really crazy, because they were doing such incredible construction out there.<n>And I remember all the headlights on all the cars were painted black for the first half, the first, the top semi-circle was black so that when if you went out at night, the light would shine just down on the road and not straight ahead.<n>Everybody had window shades, you didn't have blinds back then, but everybody had window shades that were blackout shades and you had to pull them down at night before you turned on any of the lights, because everyone was deathly afraid that the Germans or the Japanese were going to come bomb us.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
So, for fifty cents and hour, I took piano lessons.<n>And I went around once a week, because I could walk.<n>She, Mother would cross the street with me and then I could walk to the piano teacher, whose name was, oh gosh, what was her name?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
I never will forget, she had this great big Chow dog, the one, the kind with the black tongue, and I was petrified of that dog!<n>She always kept him in the backyard, so I never went in the backyard.<n>I'd always go in the front door there instead of going around to the back.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt

And he was 50 at this point in time, or 51.<n>And we went down to Atlanta for him to talk to people down there and they told him that they couldn't do anything so if he really wanted to be in the army he needed to come back and go up to the Pentagon.<n>So we drove up to Washington, and he went to the Pentagon and tried really hard for them to take him back and they said that what he was doing with the post office was in the best interest of the government and the country and he could serve much better by getting the mail to the soldiers.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_WorthingtonFrances.txt
