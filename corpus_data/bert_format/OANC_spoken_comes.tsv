[SEP] And every stop we make, now you got to remember when those bus doors open what little heat that's in that bus goes out that door and the cold	comes	in.

[SEP] I don't think, I was just kind of, I was about four or four and a half and I remember stuffing those petals up her nose and I thought it was great and then Mom	comes	down and she was really disappointed in both of us. [SEP] I think she was most unhappy with me because, you know, ah, ah, Christy was only one or one and a half or two and I was the big brother so from there I guess I remembered mom being upset with me because ah Christy had all those petals up her nose and it took a long time to take them out there was a lot of them up there, but, ah, later on, as I grew older, we moved around a lot when I was a kid I remember the first day I woke up and there was a moving truck.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4

Yes, yes. [SEP] Um, my husband and I both tend to be very critical when it	comes	to story lines and stuff like that. [SEP] And while we're watching something, I'll say, "OK honey, what's going to happen next?"	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4
Very much so. [SEP] She's, um, and probably, liked poetry, love of poetry	comes	from her because she would quote poetry all the time.

He tells us his story, he says, you know, "You've got to watch out for your arm.

[SEP] Um, her story actually is what impacted me the most in my life, um, when I think of the things she went through growing up, and, um, how my mother was conceived and everything on that nature, which it gets a little personal, but it's, you don't think of your grandmother telling you that, but she did.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LuhrChantal.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4
OK, so I'm thinking 10 minutes from my house, what can happen? [SEP] Well she's gone, and no sooner than she	comes	back, what do she tell me? [SEP] "Oh I hit something."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LuhrChantal.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4

And, um, so anyways, were talking about it and I was telling him how he kept coming in about the blades and the fan belt and he said, "Yeah, they're out, they're going to do that tell them not to worry about anything." [SEP] So there	comes	the little man. [SEP] He says, "I need to talk to you out here."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4
No one here, no wait," you know? So he	comes	back in, he has this in his hand, he says, "Here put this in your pocketbook. [SEP] You take this to the dealership and you have then put it back on there.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4
They didn't rotate, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. [SEP] So the guy	comes	back in, and I'm like, "If he's coming for me I'm about to be really upset with these people. I'm about to call my dad."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4
And say, "I just can't handle this." [SEP] So the guy	comes	in, he takes the other guy out, and says, "I need to talk to you." [SEP] He takes him out there, he says, he asked, I could hear, I mean it's right outside the door.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4
So then he's getting his oil changed and he leaves. [SEP] And then this other lady	comes	in and I warn her. [SEP] I'm like, "You might just want to back out now because, you know, this is major problems at this place."	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4

But, so, it was about three or four o'clock, anyway, so we sat on the curb and waited for this guy. [SEP] He	comes	first and assesses the situation and said, "I think that your clutch cable snapped and it's not really a big deal, we can rig it up, so you guys can get to where you got to go, you just have to get it fixed." [SEP] So fine, so he leaves.	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4
So fine, so he leaves. [SEP] And we flag down an officer and he	comes	and he tries and tells us, he proceeds to tell us there was a black belt, wait the murder belt? [SEP] I don't know	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4

Actually, I think it is most girls in general. [SEP] It's just a natural thing if you, if you have certain guy friends that you become very possessive over and you see someone, whether it's their new girlfriend or their new best friend or whatever,	comes	in and takes up some of your time, I think it's just human nature to get jealous and to kind of put up a, you know, an offensive front to whoever the invader or the intruder is.

[SEP] And a car	comes	by and sees see a pocketbook they think, you know, we're going to pick this up and do one of two things.

it's inexcusable if you want to come and want my money come and convince me don't call me on the phone yeah that's true i i guess that's uh where the old answering machine	comes	into play just screen a hundred percent of your calls and you don't have that that problem yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw2824-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4

yeah right i think and it's a sad thing to say but i think it really depends on how much money it you know money it always	comes	back to money everything does but if uh Jerry Jones continues to pay these guys what you know they say they're paying them i don't know you know i think it depends on you end up you know the best players will come there if they're going to be paid the most so	#telephone#	telephone_sw2863-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4

yeah she's still she's still there but it looks like uh she may have some the opposition or they're they're trying to beat them she's been in for so long so we may hear some interesting things about her before election time	comes	up um-hum	#telephone#	telephone_sw2872-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4
well i don't know it seems like there there are a lot of a lot more men at least in the the college level so well and that	comes	once again you know is that you can teach in elementary school you can even substitute in elementary school in the state of Texas without a uh without a certificate	#telephone#	telephone_sw2872-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4

uh-huh they do try to say you you know you should have it certain way but um on the the slick newspaper print that	comes	in with like the Sunday papers and so on they haven't really protested magazines shouldn't be as a rule should not be put in but there are always a few of those pages and they must have a better way to do it now because they they haven't gotten too upset about that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2878-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4

right and that's difficult because i think in the long run uh part of the problem in society and maybe part of what happens to the bad the negative attitude of women working	comes	about because children remember the the traumas of their mothers trying to work and run the household and some of those things that that has not changed and i think that's a serious issue	#telephone#	telephone_sw2885-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4

well as a matter of fact uh it's it's funny that i chose this subject because uh uh the city of Raleigh about six weeks ago has just uh put in a city wide recycling uh regime in which uh bottles and newspapers are recycled and a truck	comes	around uh once every couple of weeks and they separate your bottles for you and your newspapers and uh and they give you little uh or actually fairly large green plastic uh containers to put out curbside and all that so i think this is a real sign of progress here in the city of Raleigh	#telephone#	telephone_sw2928-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4
and uh i'm sure it's costing the city of Raleigh money but of course i mean that	comes	out of the taxes and so the people are ultimately paying for it and i think that people ought to ultimately pay for the convenience of having newspapers and bottles and and plastics and all that	#telephone#	telephone_sw2928-ms98-a-trans.txt	come	spoken	OANC_spoken	4
