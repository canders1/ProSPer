And I, uh, too often, much too often, see people, um, feeling superior somehow because they don't read, they don't think, they don't experience other ideas.<n>And so, uh, those things come about through the work of reading rather than through listening to some person on the street corner or, uh, gazing on TV.<n>Well, thank you for being part of this study<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_AdinolfiDavidandGail.txt
Then when, well, since I lived alone, only with my son, they, would seek me out because, I always had, everything, because I had all kinds of animals, including doves from Castile, uh, turkeys, ducks, hens, pigs, cows, all kinds of animals.<n>So they would, they would always come to me, and they told me, "Ma'am, sell us milk, sell us yogurt, sell us cheese, or sell us a, a hog, a plump hog, well I had to sell them, and I am going to sell," he'd said, "if you sell them to everyone else, sell to us, too."<n>I say to him, "OK."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt
And that's how, I kept on, working and, with them.<n>They there, well, they'd come from time to time to buy things, until one day, well, they already had been there for several years, when, all of a sudden along came a young fellow who went around with them whose name was Jose, they call him "Chepon" because he was tall, white, and all.<n>So, he, he came looking for, yogurt, I don't know what he came looking for, for me to sell him.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt

After I worked there, then, that, I went to, San Miguel, because my daughter, also, had, she needed me.<n>And, I kept on, and finally when I saw that life was really expensive, and I didn't have, I couldn't work anymore since I'm not a professional, then I decided to come (to the US), because also, well, the, there in that area, since now there wasn't anywhere to work, I had left hidden from the guerrillas, and, well, that's what I continued.<n>Well, and I forgot to tell you when the soldiers came, to my house, the guerrillas were there, the guerrillas went back.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt

This as a young child kind of stunned me you know that we're going to go evacuate pews from a church and we're not going to bring any tools with us of course this was predating Makita battery tools looking back in retrospect we could have used Makita tools would have been far more productive but carrying the pews out of that church and loading them in that truck and by the time we got done the trailer wheels were covered with water and uh, we just kind of made it by the skin of our teeth that we got everything out of there.<n>Yeah, um, how about because I know weather always reeked uh, certainly during the wintertime and all of the snowstorms that would come uh.<n>\\<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
It was the closest seat, she was only on the bus a few minutes and then we were dumping the elementary kids and we had plenty of room again.<n>So she, we would always fuss about her sitting with us but anyway this one morning I putting siding dad and I are putting siding on her house and nobody come to the door.<n>The door was unlocked and I had to get the windows open, so I just kind of go cruising through the house upstairs try to find my way to the window.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
Now that was uh, man the most flavorful cigarette I'd ever smoked, course at 12 what did you ever smoke you know?<n>But uh, come mealtime boy this little apartment with central air conditioning running, the smoke hung about four and a half five feet down from the ceiling.<n>I mean literally you could just see it hang, it looked like a fire scene on the news it was awful.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
But fortunately they didn't.<n>One story does come to my mind though where you painted the foundation coating on the house and got tar all over you.<n>Do you remember that?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
Yeah.<n>And the afternoon would come around around two.<n>Oh yeah, I want to quit early today.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_BorelRaymondHydeII.txt
Specifically, I mean, if you want to work at, work at one of these places, they, they, uh, generally have a lot of free help, so, uh, you're not going to make a whole lot of money doing this and they expect you to put in a full time schedule so you really can't work another job.<n>But at any rate, I had this, this freedom and, um, the girl had come into my life to, to go and pursue this dream, so, um, I started working at place called D&D Studios, which was known for doing, um, a lot of hip hop music, kind of stuff similar to what I was interested in and I was hoping I'd be able to make some, some connections at least, maybe do a little bit of networking there, and, uh, I met some pretty cool people, did some really kind of really interesting projects, um, but--<n>What kinds of people?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CerdaAdam.txt

, I had some teachers that were really, um, influential about what I read and their love for literature.<n>I don't know rather, how much it directly affected the fact that I was an English major in college, but I know that, um, it didn't hurt to like to read when you have that major, um, there were some times, I remember, a fifth grade teacher and a seventh grade teacher who were especially, um, full of the love for reading and literature and they made that come alive for me as a student.<n>So, I hope somehow along the way that I've been able to pass that along to my kiddies.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CombsJane.txt
And all the adults were standing around, not really paying much attention to the children, because children, of course, were supposed seen and, uh, not heard, and not really much being seen, actually.<n>And Jesus, uh, actually made all the adults move aside, and let the little children come up.<n>And he said, "Suffer the little children."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CottonGloria.txt
And he said, "Suffer the little children."<n>In other words, you know, it might be painful for you, or inconvenient for you adult people, but, "Let the children come to me, and forbid them not," don't stop them from coming.<n>They have a place here too.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CottonGloria.txt
Found out later that the, uh, one of the old men got up every morning about 5:30 and, uh, walked the, uh, around the neighborhood and he saw us, uh, do it actually.<n>And, uh, he just followed our footprints back to the house and waited until earlier the next morning to uh, come to say anything.<n>So we thought we were being sneaky, but uh, found out the whole time we were being watched.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
And uh,<n>we ended up drinking more then going out in the water and, uh, we were out in the water and, uh, we come up and we were going to get another beer off the dock and, uh, he, uh, runs his jet ski up on land, and we had to pull it back and put it in water.<n>And we check it out and it is all right and by this time we are getting pretty, uh, inebriated, I guess you'd call it, and, uh, we were out there just acting stupid on the jet skis.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
So we take it back to my house and, uh, we are sitting there trying to bend it back and, uh, so his parents don't get mad at him that he messed up his jet ski or whatever.<n>So, uh, we are at the house trying to bend it back and my parents come down and they are like, "Are y'all all right?"<n>We're like, "Yeah, yeah we're fine," you know.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
So, uh, we get the handlebar bent back and, uh, we take off and, um, we are on the way to his house, and uh, I run off the road at one point.<n>And, uh, the trailer, the trailer doesn't hit anything but at one point it hits a mailbox, and my friend asked if I was all right and I said, "Sure I'm fine," you know, I had no idea what I was doing so we get to his house and, uh, I found out my parent's had, uh, called over there beforehand to tell his parents to come out there and meet me and take me home when I got there.<n>Well when I got there, uh, I just rolled in there we dropped the jet skis off, and I just jetted right out all of the sudden, you know his parents didn't even know we had got there, and, uh, my friend Eric and he asked me again, "Are you OK to drive?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_CoxJeremy.txt
And I also tend to, um, hear about authors from, you know, friends or, or hear of a famous book from a friend and I'll read one and if there happens to be a series on it then, you know, I'll start reading those.<n>I actually just started reading, uh, the first three books of the Harry Potter series and I think those are intended for a much younger audience, but I've actually read all, the first three that have come out and I've enjoyed them `cause that's basically, it's about a kid who's a magician, basically, finds out that he's a magician.<n>So that kind of, you know, peaked my interest when I started reading it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt
Um, and one of my friends was joking around on it and actually fell through the ice.<n>And, uh, a bystander had to come over and basically fish him out and the kid could've died.<n>So, I'll tell my kids to, to stay away from thin ice.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt
So I didn't really hear too many stories about, um, you know, where they came from.<n>But more of like the actual journey over and, and what it was like to first come here.<n>OK.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_DeLuciaBrian.txt
The other, because I would, and they kept giving me gifts of books because they knew, knew I liked to read.<n>And they were, it would, it would generally be series and like for example I remember, now I, now I recall uh, I'd gotten a series, uh, they'd come in box sets at Christmas and they'd be paperbox, paperbacks in a box with a eight or ten books in them.<n>And I remember reading, like, uh I remember reading Sherlock Holmes mysteries this way and I remember reading books by J.RR.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichDavid.txt
I wouldn't say I lived in dread, but I always a little afraid of that year--<n>That this was the year that these, these events would come true and that there would be a Third World War.<n>In fact, I remember, it was seventh grade<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichDavid.txt
You don't elaborate on it much?<n>No, no, but I remember it, like, um, most of my memories of, of, childhood memories, I guess were, were of that beach house and you know, my grandmother, and my mother and my sisters would stay there during the week and then on the weekend the men would come down, like the men meaning my grandfather, and my father and that kind of thing.<n>Um hum.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_EmrichDavid.txt
He came, he opened the door and I remember looking back and seeing the expression on his face, and I could tell that he was disappointed.<n>He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't, I wasn't really sure if what I had done was really, really wrong I just knew that he wasn't very happy about what was going on by the way he opened the door and by the way he told me I needed to come into the house, and I, I came over there and I stepped up and I didn't even say, "Bye," to my friend and was probably not into that kind of thing I didn't really notice at that time probably I just went into the house.<n>And Dad said he had noticed, he had seen me throwing tomatoes in Mrs. Faulk's yard, so he told me that I was in trouble and I was going to get a spanking, and, um, I was kind of uh, uh looking for an out so I was smart enough to say, "Hey Dad!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
This is just," you know, "Look you're in trouble.<n>You're not eating your lunch," come with him, so I went, he, I had to follow him and remember being really nervous and he sat me down a corner and he told me I had to sit there until I ate all my lunch, and I remember, um, crying for a long time and I think that basically what happened there was that was just an amazing mood swing because I went from being extremely<n>happy, and I was<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FarrowThomas.txt
I'm getting up.<n>I'm leaving," because when he had come in, it was like he was short with me and I'm asking him a question and he's not answering it and he's his final thing was, "Well I need it by such and such meeting," so, just telling me, "I don't give a damn that you're having trouble.<n>I don't care how you get it done," he just wants it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
So anyhow, I think I spoke to Ramona again.<n>No, it was just that one time in the morning, and she said that she was going to come back to the office.<n>Well, I wasn't even thinking about that, but I was so frustrated, and, I ended up talking to him again.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt
She was still in there.<n>I didn't ask him till after she left, but anyhow, um, um she told me that he had come in she basically, um, no that was after.<n>Anyhow the man comes in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt

Is it like that all the time?<n>Yep whenever he there, um, which he's not there he's there most of the time but he is gone a lot but whenever he is there, and especially if he gives you something to do it's like you don't even want it because you know it's going to be that way and it's like other people hesitate to come through because they don't want to have said something wrong and then you go back to him well like, you know, such and such helped me and it's not like you're ratting anybody out you're just saying you know such and such helped me and that's how I got to this number but it's like people are hesitating basically and it's really frustrating.<n>So what is it that they wanted you to do?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FeberAngelina.txt

They would go, you know, just go out of the fence.<n>A lot of times they would get their horns and stuff caught into the, um, fences because there were square fences that my father himself put up all around the property but they would get their horns and stuff, and they would jump over the fence very easily so they would be on the side of the highway and at least 4 or 5 times that I can remember the police would have to come and say, you know, "You have to get your animals."<n>And our father always told us not to say they are animals.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FosterDimitra.txt
, and I thought this was really crazy because who else in the neighborhood had goats and chickens and stuff and so but he was convinced that they could not prove that those were our goats so but it was very embarrassing as a child living in Mallard Creek because people, everybody knew when you rode a school bus, um, we didn't have the yard with the flowers and stuff.<n>We had the goats out there and often our animals would get loose and we had to go out and follow our cow home or something like that, or the, um, animal control would come out to like subdue a cow if it would get too far away so that's really the story I have today, um<n>it was just really a awkward experience with him and his animals.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FosterDimitra.txt
it was just really a awkward experience with him and his animals.<n>Other thing that he did with animals was in Greece in his culture a goat is really an important meat; kind of a delicacy, and he even ended up selling goats from this suburb area and the Greek people would come out, pick out their goat, which was really sad for my brother and I because we as children, you know, goats were our friends and pets stuff, and they would come out and pick out their goat and then they would proceed to kill it on property<n>and it was really horrible for us as children it was traumatizing.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FosterDimitra.txt
But all of a sudden, we was called out to look at what was flying.<n>Well they looked like two big gliders flying over the base and they made a circle and come in and landed and I didn't know whether it was a glider or what it was I hadn't heard the name U2 when I first arrived.<n>Come to find out it was a U2 aircraft but we couldn't, we could not say one word about what it was; nothing to our wives, kids or anybody.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Michael Santo of, of Firewell and Company, of Buffalo, NY, they was the one that uh, manufactured, uh, invented the high O2 regulator before that they built fire control on the stove well.<n>Anyway, they come up with this invention of the high O2 regulator.<n>Say it was a tremendous breakthrough for Firewell and Company.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Each pilot has a different breathing capacity and we would have to, uh, uh, bend then individual over in the pressure suit uh, uh, I'd have to have to set it for, uh, a second, or which was going through school.<n>Then he'd dress me, and, uh, he'd set the injection on me and you, uh, uh, we'd have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then we'd come up breathing as hard as we could, and you better if uh, the, the, the top portion of your helmet surged, which you had rubber around the neck and the visor closed.<n>And, uh, if it surged and just kept surging it would go 'whish,' and, like it was going to pull your head off.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Also, oh, let me go through this.<n>About, uh, less than two months after uh, uh, we finished the school and was set the injections on pilots for about two months, Firewell and Company come up with an automatic, fool-proof uh, uh, that uh, the regulator adjusted itself with a little valve that moved back and forth.<n>It would not burst the lungs, it would not over inflate it, it was so perfect that you needn't even have to open the kit to set the injection.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Just give me a minute if you want to cut it off, I'd, uh, go.<n>Uh, well, of course, you know, () was shot down over Russia in 19 and 60, and then we come with the Cuban Crisis.<n>It was, uh, which we, uh, had Rudolph Anderson in a, a formulation of three U2's.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Well if, uh, I think this is official history.<n>If they would have kept moving with that ship towards Cuba, it's my understanding that, uh, we come within six minutes of nuclear war because President Kennedy would have launched the missiles uh, on Russia.<n>But anyway, Nikita Khrushchev backed down, turned all of his ships around, and headed back to Russia.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
I told them my sister's.<n>They asked a few questions and I answered them and they said, "Get your baggage and leave there immediately, and come to the address you were supposed to when you arrived in Washington."<n>I go ahead and picked the baggage and went to the address I was supposed to.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
They told me that, uh, that I would be called in a guy at the end for me to meet.<n>It was another GI and said I would go with him on Monday morning to a certain location, and we never was for many, many years, we could not even mention the location, but now I have the declassification of it, Roadrunner's International right there in it's authorized, and it tells all about the A-12 Blackbird crew that I was going to in early 1963 and I guess it was the most classified thing that there was at that time in the United States but when I got out and gone out found out what was going into and I looked at one of those birds, there was actually bile come into my mouth.<n>Now that's how, uh, I stay buckled in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
Different, totally different types parachutes and in an bird that flies, uh, three times the speed of sound, over 22,000 miles an hour.<n>You can't even imagine that and I really can't get over, as, as many pilots that I put in that aircraft, and know, and seen them come in ( ) and go walk up the plank to, to get him out of the aircraft and he waits for me to get him out.<n>And then he looks.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt

Once I climbed a tree, a pine tree, and I got to the top and it started swaying.<n>And I was afraid, and I couldn't come down, and so my daddy had to get this really high ladder and come up it and get me down.<n>You know about that don't you?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt

We, this was at the beach, and we'd go to the beach during the day and the movies or stuff at night.<n>The family would come up here.<n>The most traumatic thing, my daddy decided to build a house when I was in the 10th grade so, and he literally built the house, and when we moved into it there was no sheet rock on the inside and the plumbing wasn't hooked up yet.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt
and piles of dirt and then the porch wasn't finished and we had boards going up to the porch so you had to walk up the boards to get in.<n>So I had my dates pick me up at somebody else's house because I was embarrassed for them to come my house.<n>But I know how to put sheet rock up and do shingles and all of that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GillardSylvia.txt
It made a huge impression on me and was a big thing.<n>Columbus, GA is the home of Fort Benning, GA, where the largest infantry school in the world at that time was there, and as a kid walking to school, and believe it or not, I did walk four or five miles to school and I would go up Brown Avenue, which was at that time the only road that would allow the convoys to come through.<n>And I would walk along the road to school and convoys of young men would, uh, ride by in the backs of trucks and I would wave at them and it was not a sexual thing in those days.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
Said, "It's drafty and in the winter you would be cold," and I think it was the fall of the year.<n>And they looked so forlorn that my dad said, "Well, come in and we'll talk about it."<n>So I moved in at that juncture with my brother.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
And we just became very, very close friends and loved them dearly.<n>And, uh, he did go off to war and did come back and many years after that nearly every year they would come down to see us in Columbus from Erie.<n>In fact, when he came back, one time he gave me a beautiful large pearl, perfect pearl and years and years later, when my father died in 1978, I had, took some of the money that I got from his inheritance and, uh, bought a heart and placed that pearl in the center of the heart and now wear it; one of my treasured possessions.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt
We had a nice sized one that sat on the floor and listening to President Roosevelt, uh, give his famous speech of a day that will live in infamy and us sitting in total silence, uh, as the four members of our family listening to it.<n>I also remember one time, uh, Warm Springs, GA was not very far from where I lived and that's where President Roosevelt would come as uh, uh, when he had polio when he was a young man I think.<n>At any rate he would come to Warm Springs and he'd come through Columbus.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GoodroeBarbara.txt

Like, I write for myself in my journal and I don't hide things in that, but I haven't gotten to the point of sharing my journals with the world!<n>Did your journaling come from a teacher's, uh, uh, expectation of you?<n>I know that some teachers, they require a student to write in a journal everyday.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
Umm, I know I have written it down, but I am trying to think, where is my book?<n>It will come to me, and I'll, I'll maybe be able to find it, and I don't mind sharing it with you.<n>But, my, my focus was in, in solitude.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt
It's, you know, somebody's drawing.<n>Well, Harold was a draw, was one who, who drew, and he would draw things with his pen that would come alive<n>.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt

And I don't believe in throwing books away.<n>I come from a family where you just don't throw a book away!<n>It's a treasure.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GregoryAvis.txt

Because I know my Granny grew up in Cabarrus County on a farm and was one of three or four kids, and she inherited her father's mother for a season out of every year.<n>Poor old woman would come all wrapped up in layers of clothes, and my mother told me this not long before she died, but she said when she was little she remembered her granny showing up and her mother saying, "The first thing I'm going to do is unwrap this cocoon."<n>She wouldn't have changed her clothes since the last time Granny had seen her probably--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
Maryann Joyner, uh, her father went off to fight in the war, on the Confederate side, from Cabarrus County.<n>And he didn't come back, which left her mother kind of in limbo.<n>They presumed dead, the war ended, he never came back, they never learned what happened to him, and so she took up with this, I guess he was a traveling salesman, with a wagon and a mule.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_GubbinsPat.txt
.<n>Uh, so then we, then you go through all these passage ways and you come into this, um, this long stretch where all of a sudden it's this like this big long cave and it's all, there's stuff all around the walls and there are, uh, and there are all these little tiny action figures little dolls and so on jumping up and making faces and all that kind of stuff, and singing and the music is, uh<n>.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HebardCliff.txt
And it was so miserable and the house was so crowded and the kids were so wild that by Sunday by that Christmas afternoon they had taken everything down and boxed everything back up again just to get it out of the way just because they, uh, were so miserable that Christmas because my brother had been so sick.<n>Um, another time, this was for the, um, other brother, um, the one that had been sick as a baby, they bought him, one year, all this um cowboy and Indian stuff, and again all this assembly was required, and, um, the same friends that had helped put together all the boxes a few years earlier for my other brother, um, had come over and they had to put all these decals and stickers on everything and then had to individually dress all the different Indians, and, um cowboys and you know the tiny guns and the little itty-bitty tiny holsters that they had to put around the waist of all the different cowboys, and, uh, then, you know, all the little, um, suits and headdresses and everything that had to go on all the little Indians and the horses and the saddles and all this kind of stuff.<n>And Dad said they were up till like four o'clock in the morning getting all this stuff put together and were just exhausted and about dead.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt
And so that was my big Christmas present well when I put makeup on her, um, it just wouldn't even rub off, I mean it was just like this, you know, permanent stuff that you couldn't even smudge off or wash off even with soap and water.<n>It just absolutely would not come off, and so it was like one time and you were done and that was it.<n>And I remember being so disappointed and my dad was just furious.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt
But that was, you know, a very traumatic event.<n>Um, I remember another time, uh, being told, uh, about a storm that had come up that my dad had taken, um, my two brothers, and, um, I can't remember if I was with them or not.<n>I think I was.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt
Well a stock person or a worker or somebody found me and took me up to the, um, to the desk, and, uh, they were asking what my dad's name was or what he looked like and I remember saying, "He's just a bald-headed man named Ray."<n>And so they, over the intercom they had to just say, "Would the bald headed man named Ray who owns a little red- headed girl please come to the service desk?"<n>And so he had to come get me and was just absolutely mortified.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt
And so they, over the intercom they had to just say, "Would the bald headed man named Ray who owns a little red- headed girl please come to the service desk?"<n>And so he had to come get me and was just absolutely mortified.<n>Here, you know, he had just gotten back in from, you know, out of the country and, you know, takes his daughter somewhere, and then loses her, and I mean I wouldn't get near him.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_HouseJennifer.txt
So it was quite, you needed a scorecard to keep track of who was who.<n>And it got even more confusing when my cousins got older and would bring girlfriends or boyfriends or spouses who I never met before to, oh, the reunions and it all just, ah, so, it's still, uh, these days, I was at one about two years ago a reunion and there are still about 75 to 80 people who show up consistently every year although it's, it's a different group of people they'll be, you know, there's a group of maybe 20 or 25 who don't come to every reunion like me but there'll be a different 20 or 25 in there.<n>So the number of people who show up is pretty consistent it's just that the group changes somewhat from year to year as the people are, are available to make the weekend or aren't.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt
I've got an aunt who's a widow and a cousin.<n>I, I'm running out of fingers here but, ah, and then an aunt or ah, a, a cousin and his wife and their three kids, and, let's see, that's about a dozen people right there that I can think of off the top of my head and then quite a few cousins and their and their families and kids are in the Toronto area some of, some of them have moved away and come back, ah, but everybody, most of them have sort of settled in and around the Toronto area in the suburbs in one direction or another.<n>Oh there's, in fact, there's a cousin and her husband and their, ah, their six kids who just moved back to Guelph after having been ah, ah his business had taken him away for a couple of years but now they're back in Guelph so that's number six.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt
So it's, um, almost like you'll, you'll meet, ah, if you go to Guelph you'll meet someone will probably know a Jamieson there.<n>Yeah, yeah because some of, like my aunt who just died was a bookkeeper who worked at a lot of local businesses and was extremely gregarious, so I think she was probably on a first name basis with a awful lot of the people who shopped downtown or whoever went downtown she was she lived there all her life and just knew a lot of people and they sort of come out of that kind of, that Irish tradition like everybody's your friend, everybody's your neighbor and even people that, ah should be fairly casually, she'd greet those people by name and know a little bit about them, ah, and so yeah she's, ah, and my cousin, one of my cousins, has a couple of businesses in town and I think is relatively well-known is on some sort of city board, or something like that.<n>Yeah the family is big enough and the city is small enough I think that you would run into a decent number of people who would know a Jamieson or two.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JamiesonSean.txt
And, um, we pass, um, we pass, uh, uh, the car dealerships on our left hand side.<n>We're running 70 as we come past probably the, probably at Harris Blvd.<n>And so I went ahead and let my units know up ahead as soon as we got into Matthews, he's getting blue lighted.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt
Uh,<n>Brian's still behind me and, um, so I'm getting on with the Highway Patrol, trying to have the Highway Patrol come and, and meet with me because we're heading towards Union County.<n>Not that I can't chase into Union county, but I'd much rather have the Highway Patrolman out there myself, because they'll ram somebody off the road in a heart beat!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_JenkinsJoe.txt
The meager looking pieces.<n>So my mother use to sit back in her chair in the den and talk about how one Saturday Granny, uh, had decided she was going to go to town and you know back then, you're talking, oh probably 1930s, early 1930s, uh, my mother would've been 10 or 12, somewhere around there, and Granny, uh, went to the train track to get on the little trolley train, whatever they had at that time to come downtown.<n>Uh-huh.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LeakJeffrey.txt
Everybody knows where the health department is there.<n>Well, standard procedure back then, I don't know what it is now, is that you come in, someone comes in and they give you, now I don't if it's like this now, but back then they would give you a bag of prophylactics, condoms, all right.<n>So they gave me a bag, and I didn't really, you know, pay any attention to it.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LeakJeffrey.txt
And he never told or anything.<n>Well the thing about it was in, I'm sort of telling this story out of order, but my grand, after my grandfather died and my great grandmother was sort of alone, um, it must have been right around Thanksgiving and she was feeling real depressed or whatever and this lady came and invited her to come to dinner, and when she, and so my grandmother didn't think she really wanted to go and everything, but she thought, "Well, OK," she'd go ahead and go.<n>And so she went in.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LidingtonLinda.txt
Um, and I remember the day that um, I was five years old and I was getting ready to go to kindergarten when my mom told me that my dad wasn't coming home, and um, it was the summer before I went in kindergarten.<n>And I was sitting in my dad's chair waiting on him to come home and, uh, my uh, momma told me daddy wasn't coming home, but uh, that's really the only two things I remember about my daddy being young, uh, I remember one other night, with uh, when he took my brother and sister to a, um, a race car, um, a race or something, but I stayed at home with my mom, and that's really the only three times that I remember my dad, before they split up.<n>And as for my dad, you know he's a great guy, I love him, but he's set in his ways, and he's always right, he's never wrong, and you know I'm too much like my mom so we're not the best of friends, but that's my dad.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LloydTabatha.txt

Well with their tails tied together coming down the hill along came a tree and they straddled the tree, one went to the right one went to the left.<n>Course the tails were tied together, they got hung up, the knot wouldn't come undone but one of the tails did.<n>I don't know if it's true or not but that was one of the stories she told us.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LowranceSally.txt
My grandfather was Italian, full-blooded Italian, and he was, um, a prisoner of war for a while.<n>Um, he did escape and get out, and so him and my grandmother were like, he would travel, get missing, and come back, you know, but he would always be back with my grandmother and everything.<n>And there was one particular incident where they were, um, there were bombs going off, because again, this was like in the war with the Germans and so forth.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_LuhrChantal.txt

The lady's name was Ira Lee, and she was a black lady.<n>And she would come to our house once a week, and she would help my mother clean.<n>She would do all kinds of household, um, activities, because my mother had four children, very close in age and I'm sure she was a big help.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_O_ConnorChris.txt
And so that's how we found out about Ira Lee.<n>And Ira Lee come to our house once a week, and then she would help my mother, and then at dinner time, I can remember we all sit at our dinner table uh, four McDonough children and my two parents and Ira Lee always sat at the table with us.<n>I remember it very well and she was just part of our family.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_O_ConnorChris.txt
So, I just um, would like to share that story.<n>I think we, I think we've come, hopefully, we've come a long way from, from that um, mode of thinking.<n>So that maybe that kind of thinking has changed.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_O_ConnorChris.txt
And it's really I see it more with the black people than I do with the white people.<n>Um so, um yes, we've come a long, long way since when I was a little girl.<n>But we still have a long way to go too.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_O_ConnorChris.txt
So we were just like, "There goes the man with black hat."<n>Then come to find out that during that same summer, this guy that played on our football team had, supposedly was walking through the park, Briarwood Park on, um, Plaza.<n>The same, uh, elementary school that we went to.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt
He used to talk about how he's almost still scared of the Butt Hole Bandit cause nobody really knows, you know what I'm saying, what happened to the little kid who supposedly got raped.<n>Well, you know, ain't nobody still seen him to this day but most likely probably, if that did happen to him, he's probably so embarrassed to come back around or whatever they probably moved away.<n>But, I mean, you know, the Butt Hole Bandit story was, was one of the biggest ones and it was the man in the black hat.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PetersDamien.txt
They ain't mess with the his bulls or nothing.<n>They use to come on, he use to charge people to come on his property and hunt deer, and they use to sneak on and stuff and he catch them out there but he couldn't shoot them because he know he'd get lynched if he did that.<n>And then one day, um, somebody got jealous, came down, and burnt down the trailer, he had a trailer on the property, then came and burned down the trailer and burnt up the chicken coop, but eventually he got all that back.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt
They're all over the property, and they still sell the, um, you know, they rent the land out during I guess deer season to, you know, people.<n>They got to pay though, you know, to come on the property because there're deer stand all throughout.<n>And I think they should make them pay to fish because big ass lake, a big old lake out there, and they, you know, I want to go fishing there, but I'm driving from out of town and it ain't like I'm carrying some fishing rods or nothing.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PhillipsJason.txt
You know, for my own eyes?"<n>He said, "Sure come on out here."<n>I did not see one crack.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
It does not even say that, you know?<n>I said, "I saw the sign, I was excited, I got, had a Saturday off, I come in," you know?<n>OK, so anyways, so, comes back in he's all mad as hell and I was like, "What now?"<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
Oh God.<n>Yeah, he goes, "I am very upset I have been trying and trying to get this lug out of your tire and it will not come out and I am very upset.<n>It's almost to break, and my manager said, `do not do it, do not do it, do not do it,' so I put your tires back on<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
I'm like, "You might just want to back out now because, you know, this is major problems at this place."<n>And so she's watching them and they come about two or three times.<n>"You're low on transmission fluid and something squeaking here and"--<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
I said, "Well, they didn't."<n>So he puts it back on there and he goes, oh, he said, um, "Come, come back and talk to your dad and visit us and we'll do your fan belt."<n>I said, "Uh-huh, that's OK, thank you."<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PrevatteStephanie.txt
And Mary, uh, read in the paper one day about the bond referendums.<n>It was 22, 23 million dollars, an incredible amount of money, and she asked me to come down.<n>She wanted to talk to me about this bond referendum.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt
I said, "Yes ma'am."<n>But the kids didn't come prepared like they did then.<n>They didn't come disciplined, uh, now as they did then.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt
But the kids didn't come prepared like they did then.<n>They didn't come disciplined, uh, now as they did then.<n>And, um, and I believe that.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt
Uh-huh.<n>I recall her talking about how she cared for him once he did come back from the war and he had a smallpox scar that he always had problems with, which I understand there was a lot of that.<n>But, especially through the war years, he would write her and talk about, you know, his arm and she knew exactly what it was.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt
So these are some of the dearest letters.<n>And in reading her letters to him, wherever he might be, a lot of the letters come from, obviously in and around Fredericksburg, VA in 1862, 1863.<n>And, uh, she would ask, "What do we do now about the wheat?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt
"But you, and I will support you.<n>Here I am not knowing if I'll ever come home."<n>Right.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PropstKenny.txt
Um, and you look at other kinds of things and I think Charlotte, and maybe it's typical of the South, but I think that, uh, maybe there hasn't been as much growth here before and when you have growth and you have people coming in, who, looking for services.<n>And you, and you also have a, a government, um, who are, are really ready to take that challenge as opposed to just deciding that, "Hey, listen we're gonna do things the way we've done it for the last, you know, 100 years, whether new people come or need services or ask for amenities or not, we're going to keep things the way they are."<n>In fact, the town of Matthews, I think, um, at least my understanding is, is that when Providence Plantation, uh, reached a certain point in population they, they wanted to be annexed to the town of Matthews because they thought maybe that the city of Charlotte would annex them and so they wanted to, that they petitioned the town of Matthews to annex.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt
In fact, the town of Matthews, I think, um, at least my understanding is, is that when Providence Plantation, uh, reached a certain point in population they, they wanted to be annexed to the town of Matthews because they thought maybe that the city of Charlotte would annex them and so they wanted to, that they petitioned the town of Matthews to annex.<n>But the town of Matthews at that point said, "No," because they were afraid that all these people from other places would come in and be a part of the town government and change things.<n>And so they decided to, you know, basically vote the outsiders out and it will keep the town, uh, small.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt
I enjoy listening, uh, to people who have grown up in the area and who speak with that accent.<n>It used to be when you could come here that uh,<n>that still the people who were native to Charlotte or to the South were the greatest number of the population.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_PutnamScott.txt
Um, so, I don't know, um.<n>When did your, um, father's family come to the United States?<n>Well, he, he, I believe he is, I guess it would be, you'd refer to third generation.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt
Uh-huh.<n>Uh, an opportunity to come over here, I would, I would say, to practice medicine.<n>It seems like everyone in my family is, uh, a doctor.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt
And, um, the, just the same on my mother's side.<n>Just for that opportunity to come to America.<n>So, but, um, for myself, I love NC.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt
It's a lot different from the North that's for sure.<n>Can't say that I've come to love grits<n>, but, um, I've met my future wife.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt
I would, I definitely would.<n>And I would probably encourage them to come down in the NC area to play baseball.<n>It's been a great experience for me.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_QuelerAdam.txt
I was looking for a city down south and I kind of wanted an idea as to something new, something upcoming, and from what I understand, Charlotte is a quite growing city.<n>So, it seemed like a really good place to come to, and so far I really like it.<n>Um, I'm going to tell you a story about a trip I took with my sisters.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_RagoneseLaura.txt
Um<n>, like when he, one time we were at my mom's house and she had just made pies and he saw them come out of the oven, and he knew they were hot but it had been sitting on the stove for a little bit.<n>And he went up to grab it and he burned his fingers and so we told him, you know, times that we burned ourselves and that it hurts and that it will stop.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt
.<n>And so, the kids would come over and go, "Phil can we go hooker hunting?"<n>We'd do that and, um, that's my dad, Jesus!<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReeseJennifer.txt
Just anything to get out of doing my job.<n>So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow, do what she tell told me to do, she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family.<n>So she began to tell this story.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
Once upon a time there was this little girl and her family.<n>And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up, wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table.<n>And her little girl just complained, "I don't want to wash the dishes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
The first school I worked at was Enderly Park and then it was closed down.<n>So I was in those situations where I first, come first, transfer last, come first to transfer out.<n>So I had to, I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
So I had to, I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill.<n>I didn't particularly want to come here and when I came here everybody noticed that I was really, really sad because I loved being at Enderly Park.<n>But then, after awhile, I fell in love with Berryhill.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ReidSandra.txt
And then when I did go over to Japan, I did see what she was talking about and really felt guilty that we didn't believe her, totally believe her, that, that she had all this, but um, according to Japanese standards, uh, they are just very wealthy.<n>And then they come here and they look at my house<n>and they, no really, land over there is so very expensive so they are very wealthy, and then they come here, and I live in a very basic house, and they think I'm rich, so uh, that's kind of comical<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
And then they come here and they look at my house<n>and they, no really, land over there is so very expensive so they are very wealthy, and then they come here, and I live in a very basic house, and they think I'm rich, so uh, that's kind of comical<n>which we're not, we're very middle class<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
He, uh, learned a lot in the Army, and then I think I'm the only one that kind of pursued an interest in telephones and communications and such--<n>That is interesting that it would come back around that way.<n>Um, was there anything else your family used to do or talked about that you wanted to include?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ShamblinGladys.txt
It was just the kind of thing where, um, in kindergarten or even before kindergarten, it just, it just came to me that I wanted to play tee ball and from there it started.<n>And after that, I asked to put up a hoop in our backyard and luckily I had plenty of, of children my age to play with and that used to be the ritual: have the neighborhood kids come over to my hoop and we'd play basketball and it ended up I was playing with a lot of older kids and so I developed an athletic ability through playing with the neighborhood kids in basketball and just starting so early and continuing on in baseball.<n>So it's kind of just evolved.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
My dad would always play too, um, he was always just one of the kids.<n>Um, because we had, you know, when I was 10 or 12, we'd play against kids who were 14, 16 and my brother was about seven years older and he would come out and play, and so it was just kind of natural for my dad to fit in and play along.<n>And, uh, he was always good too, and he was one of the reasons, he made me good in what I was doing because he would challenge me.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
Especially when we first started dating and you didn't necessarily have the most reliable car of the people in NC.<n>Your little wrecked `84 Honda Accord wasn't necessarily the thing you were going to drive two hours away, especially two hours to come and see me.<n>But, um, one of the things I remember was you putting it, putting yourself getting in trouble, and really probably wasn't one of the wisest things we have ever done.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SheltonMichael.txt
My sister when she was like four, she went into the walk-in closet in my parent's bedroom and she put baby powder all over herself and all over the clothes.<n>And also in that same walk-in closet my sister and I, we would go in there and hide from my dad and when he got home from work and we would wait for him to come in and turn on the light and then when he walked in we'd scare him.<n>Because we'd be hiding on the shoes and behind the clothes.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SilvaIvonne.txt
Um, they sneaked out of their bedroom windows and they all met and went into the woods.<n>Um, as they thought this was really cool, and they were sitting under a big tree in the woods, the branches started moving, the kids thinking, uh, that the wind was doing it, but when the branches started to slowly come down and start touching them, they got scared, and the branches were trying to wrap around them, then the trunk of the tree started bending also.<n>And they all started screaming, running away.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SmithPatricia.txt
I'll meet Mr. Speckman."<n>So then I would forget about it and the girls would come over and they would say, "Ms. Quinn you need to meet Mr. Speckman."<n>And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
I'll meet Mr. Speckman."<n>So, um, a soccer game would come up because the boys played soccer, the Speckman boys played soccer.<n>Michaela would say, "How about it?<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
And, uh, that was when it was decided since I was going to be there, because Michaela played tennis in the fall, and Mr. Speckman was going to be there, since Ryan and Eric played soccer in the fall that was when this meeting would take place.<n>So in order to make sure that I would be there one of the Quail Girls, who lived right around the corner from the Speckmans, said she would come and she would pick me up.<n>Michaela couldn't drive me because she had to be there early to be in this program.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_SpeckmanNancy.txt
She'll tell you like it is and if you don't like it then that's just too bad.<n>But we've come to realize that's her and that's just the way it's going to have to be.<n>But, um, um, so my next story, I guess I want to talk about, uh, I guess I'll move on to kind of high school era.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt
And, uh, he had, he had a gun.<n>And well, come to find out he was a police officer but he was off-duty and he was in an unmarked car.<n>And, uh-<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StackCarmen.txt
I can remember four and earlier.<n>They come once in a while, but I don't really have anything real strong.<n>But, uh, I loved the colors and all the illustrations too, and just the zaniness.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt
I loved baseball, still do, but, uh, you know, just to read about these famous people and dream about playing sports and being some kind of hero.<n>And, uh, every once in a while, I think my dad caught onto that, but, uh, he'd come down and tell me to shut the, shut the lamp off every once in a while.<n>But, uh, I'd usually, I just read and read and read.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt
But, uh, those are the two best storytellers I know in our family.<n>I remember my dad, my dad told us he would tell us stories about his childhood but usually, usually from him that, that doesn't really come until later.<n>But, uh, when he would start telling about when he was a teenager some of the, some of the teenaged stuff he and his teenaged brothers did when they worked for their dad's business, my grandfather.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_StJohnEric.txt

yeah yeah it gets to be kind of expensive and i think you know some of the woman do uh weigh that um<n>we've had some that have had their children and not come back so it just depends i think uh well we have one now who um is is part time she works half days well actually we have two one paralegal and one secretary<n>and one attorney each have very young children and now they are part timing it is kind of like a test to see how this will work to have these people work part time<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2633-ms98-a-trans.txt
you know maybe we've um got a turn around here maybe in the beginning we thought it wasn't such a good idea but perhaps if we instrumented it here in the US<n>rather than taking all that manpower out of the US and providing a service for people to join here and do some good we could come up with some of those things<n>we have we have a lot of people that are in college and we have a lot of people that  for one reason or another that that can't get into college either they can't afford it or or perhaps they don't have the abilities<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2635-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah<n>and the judge might know or at least it it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better if it didn't we can come back for something else or or or what we've got so well we definitely need a change in the system and uh<n>that's true that's very true yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2640-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah<n>i think we should try it like you say if it doesn't work we can always come back but i think it would be a good idea to try it<n>i do too<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2640-ms98-a-trans.txt
that's uh yeah  really true but like the friends other friends of mine have cats they have four of them<n>and if they go away they have they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their cats you know their so use to the attention that if they don't get it they get really upset<n>and you know they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2641-ms98-a-trans.txt
and uh you know used to drop mice in it's like this is not these aren't pets  you know this is gross<n>yeah no that would be what did they do everyone come around and watch them i mean i guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house and you just destroyed the mice<n>yep<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2641-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah yeah and it gives you a sense um a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say oh well i don't have to pay for it now but you're going to have to pay for it and it seems like<n>yeah you think well i don't have it now but payday will come and then i'll have the money but that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time  yes<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt
um<n>you know and i'm i'm thinking woman  wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you but<n>right besides the fact that how much interest you pay and then this<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and um it's just unreal i mean i don't like credit cards i wish that they would come up with some other way to you know the only way you could use them is if you were<n>like on vacation they would let you use it maybe once a year you know i mean of course i guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2642-ms98-a-trans.txt
front porches are they're not very big but they're kind of coming back<n>right i i think the old ways in a lot of uh ways should come back uh<n>uh-huh uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2643-ms98-a-trans.txt
dining out seems to be a uh uh something we do off and on<n>through our lives i guess as economics and as kids come and go and uh situations change uh we used to do<n>right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>you don't want to just uh necessarily run out for you know a one hour and come back i noticed with us it's more when we do go out then we do try to make it something nice maybe a dinner theater or nice restaurant with friends<n>um sometimes lunches when we can do that that's okay too but<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2646-ms98-a-trans.txt
just being exposed to more<n>it just seems like in a larger college you i don't know you're exposed to so many more people from all over the world and i'm sure a lot of people come to you know small colleges also but just that they're more<n>of of the different cultures there not that it not that it's better but i'm just saying that i think that big<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt
because you like you said you know<n>you know everybody knows everybody and so you probably come out of it knowing and by friends i mean like contacts for when you get out of school<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2647-ms98-a-trans.txt

they can keep their eyes open yeah that will help well<n>so i think that if somebody else picks him up i think that uh if he gets out he'll come back you know i really do because he knows exactly where he lives so<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2650-ms98-a-trans.txt
yeah i know sometimes our cat will will stay out all night and<n>when he's not right at the door in the morning i really worry that something's happened to him that somebody he's got in a fight or you know somebody's hit him and and uh and if he doesn't come by mid morning then i really get scared but he's always come back eventually so<n>well that's good that's one thing about cats though they're so small and you know they can get hurt a lot easier you know and then so that would make you really tend to worry about them you know if they're not right there<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2650-ms98-a-trans.txt
huh<n>yeah that's true i i like the way they come up and they'll<n>they'll put their head underneath your hand you know it's that uh and most dogs do that i mean i don't know any that really don't i mean you know they know exactly how to get that attention you know they just<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2650-ms98-a-trans.txt

somehow i think if the punishment doesn't fit the crime the crime's more likely to happen<n>right i think in a way it's unfortunate they've come up with with nice ways to<n>um execute people i guess to me if if i was a uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2674-ms98-a-trans.txt
there's no reason i should pay for this person to spend the rest of his life in in prison<n>so you think our our uh values have to come down to dollars and cents<n>no but i don't think uh i don't think it's right for somebody to uh for me to to uh pay for something i mean the way the way it is right now the prisons are overcrowded<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2674-ms98-a-trans.txt

well i'll tell you why i feel so i feel strongly about this topic i don't know a whole lot about the immigration laws but i do know that in the where i live and i teach school<n>there are so many Orientals that have come here and there's a lot of Mexican people too which is not neither here nor there but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent<n>uh very wise in money matters and have taken have taken over a lot of businesses and have really<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum no i don't i don't know i lived in the Middle East for sometime and i i do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because uh i know a lot of people that<n>were in a sense not qualified is the wrong word but certainly were deserving to come and it seemed to take them a long time or or there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here and the kids in this area are very bright and come from you know parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and and uh very interested in their education but<n>uh i think in the last year i'm not if i'm not mistaken in four of the six high schools<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt
i was going to say i'm not sure i i would guess that it's not that they are any brighter but they just maybe work harder or<n>well i i think things come easy for them too but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States i don't<n>they uh don't want to work for anything they want it to come to them but and be there but they don't want to work hard and these kids work really hard and and they have<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt

um-hum<n>you know um welcoming welcoming everyone that wants to come here and even when i was younger when when i was in college i was a member of the NAACP because i lived up north and i was very into that the human rights part of everything<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum um-hum<n>well and exactly that's exactly true plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back<n>and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them and and uh plus a lot of American dollars but in in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too you know you just don't know<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2709-ms98-a-trans.txt

right and it's year it's years away but it it will be<n>it probably will be implemented on the East Coast first because the FBI headquarters is here in in Virginia and the this will probably be the places that will start to come in faster so yeah it will take a while before um<n>it comes in but that's one reason why i guess the the plan is here in Maryland um because i actually just received uh information from my um uh the um Brady Organization that um they want this seven day bill passed until<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2721-ms98-a-trans.txt
and this you know this is another reason though i think that ah<n>makes me real aware and encouraging because i know there's always a a a tidbit of information that's going to come across some<n>i'm either gonna read it or i'm gonna hear it that they can turn right around and use in a report<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2722-ms98-a-trans.txt

one of the reasons i guess is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working<n>they get bombarded with junk and they don't have to do anything around the house they never learned to be responsible when the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while and they come back and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2790-ms98-a-trans.txt

i mean i was shocked i mean the dish was dirty um<n>it's one of those ones you have a bad experience and say i don't think i'll come back here<n>yeah where you felt like you were<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2821-ms98-a-trans.txt

oh and also they're very heavy and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier<n>right there's one big one that has come off and short of putting nails through it we can't get it back on<n>um<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2832-ms98-a-trans.txt

well<n>i think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens we're going to have to bite the bullet and we're all going to have to do it i it just isn't fair though that when this happens in some places it needs to all come off everywhere<n>yeah yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2839-ms98-a-trans.txt

and i think that's why i i liked him so well but uh i don't know you know when i i watch it and then i start sort of seeing myself enjoying it i'm like you're just you're just doing this for the players you know don't think about Jerry Jones or Jimmy Johnson either one but<n>you know it'd just be so aggravating when they did win and then uh Jerry Jones would come out of the uh you know the press box i mean i would just go uh you know wild it's like it ruined the whole game for me because i had to look at him you know<n>is he the owner<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2863-ms98-a-trans.txt

uh-huh<n>i've seen like all the movies that come to the dollar theatre there's a dollar theatre in town we don't really pay um five bucks to go to see a movie because they have pretty good movies you know<n>not too long after they've been out at the dollar theatre so we go there we used to go there quite a bit we haven't been there lately very much but i think the last movie i saw was Awakenings<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2864-ms98-a-trans.txt

oh<n>the the inspector would come by and say or the rifle range uh owner would come by and look at everyone's gun before he would step in front of you and so you need some sort of common sense as well as expertise with a gun before you put a bunch of dummies out there in front with guns now<n>that's true<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2867-ms98-a-trans.txt
and<n>which i guess if you got turmoil in your personal life you're going to let it come into work but<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2870-ms98-a-trans.txt

and uh but i think the adults are the ones that have to lead the way and they have required the the students in the cafeterias to recycle but of course you know that<n>it doesn't go all the way they they make the effort they try but i think as the younger children come on maybe they'll be a little more conscious of it and eventually<n>that that was sort of my point too in addition to being a a good focal or central collection point it does raise the awareness if you do it through the school system and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2878-ms98-a-trans.txt
they put up a front to me you know they're not showing you the real person anyway they're just show showing what the public wants to see<n>uh that's true unless you unless you come from i come i come from a fairly small town so i i live in Rhode Island but i work in Massachusetts um<n>uh-huh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2882-ms98-a-trans.txt

um-hum sure is<n>i've done that once but it didn't come out that well<n>did you use a did you use a Zar stain<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2889-ms98-a-trans.txt

suing uh let's see who was he suing the parents of this girl he had murdered because he said if they had been stricter parents<n>she wouldn't have been out and he wouldn't have murdered raped and murdered her and so he was suing them and i thought that shouldn't have even come to court you know<n>that should have been laughed out of court isn't that pitiful i<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw2892-ms98-a-trans.txt

but uh at the same time i think there are a lot of there is a lot of good that the United States and other countries can do as far as example and and um<n>i think some different things could come from what's happened than what we expect<n>well yeah well yeah um i i guess we could be a catalyst for their change i um the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there and i don't think we'd be talking about this<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3012-ms98-a-trans.txt
all right what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over<n>well i have a really great one that i make in the summertime because it's cool and it's uh it's just really pretty easy it's pretty much dumping things in and stirring and i like that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3013-ms98-a-trans.txt

yeah well we had it for awhile and it just seemed like we never watched any it we didn't have the movie channels we just had all the<n>normal ones that come and we just never watched any of them we kept a log for a month of every time we watched it and it seemed like we didn't watch even half an hour so we decided to just cancel it it does improve the reception a little bit though that's the only thing<n>yeah<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3018-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>part of it is that uh i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis and i think that if we're doing other things and these programs come in<n>sometimes they influence us and we don't know where that influence came from<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3019-ms98-a-trans.txt
and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company so i'd go out with them now see there's the problem parents don't do that they say you go outside and play<n>that's true or you go rent a video up at the store and come home and sit down and watch it you know<n>yeah i said but but we went on field trips and we did other things and i think that was<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3019-ms98-a-trans.txt

you know this type of a moral stance<n>that people come down on you it's like you know hey everybody has to be free to do their own thing and i disagree and i think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime<n>yes yes well i mean i i guess so what i wanted to say and i stopped uh i do not know i got diverted was uh that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3023-ms98-a-trans.txt

and the budget is just i don't we've got a new governor democratic democratic governor female and uh<n>she's trying to cutback but she has to be so careful and that's the problem is that you if you come in too fast<n>you can't get reelected<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3032-ms98-a-trans.txt
right<n>and uh you know that's just a problem that who knows how that's gonna that's gonna come out or anything<n>but uh<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3035-ms98-a-trans.txt

that they wouldn't have much of a choice um<n>in picking somebody uh sometimes drugs don't uh the results of taking drugs don't come out until after something tragic has happened<n>and in order to uh resolve it before it happens that they feel that this is most the most direct way and<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3037-ms98-a-trans.txt

provide you with any any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your your home to a business for instance you know<n>well this this is a thing i think it's like uh back east you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities you can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it<n>if we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3040-ms98-a-trans.txt

right and the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars which is probably about what their equity is that they got out of selling their house those things are selling like hot cakes<n>must be a dream come true yeah<n>but one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill per month last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month and i thought<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3051-ms98-a-trans.txt

right right<n>and that i think is what is scary and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images um of nursing homes come from is when people have to put people in a nursing homes and they really can not afford the best<n>right and that's right i well i took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation and uh they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3052-ms98-a-trans.txt

and there is no chance of uh good companionship or doing anything<n>well that is not really true either uh i think that is a stigma and an i and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences you see those who had bad experiences talk about them<n>um right right<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3057-ms98-a-trans.txt
um-hum<n>and uh she works for one here in Dallas which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home and these these i love watching these elderly people come they will come and tell her well i am going for my tennis lessons<n>um um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3057-ms98-a-trans.txt
