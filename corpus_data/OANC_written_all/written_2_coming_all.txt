A contemporary apparel-maker, handling on average 15,000 SKUs in its collection, faces the challenge of replenishing weekly numerous retail customers at high satisfaction levels with a constantly shifting subset of its goods. Managers of such a firm must do so by drawing on information from the past weeks’ sales as well as explicitly factoring in the impact of uncertainty. They need real-time information regarding what goods their plants have in finished, work-in-process, and material inventories. They must know the lead-time requirements for procuring textile products and establish relationships with at least some textile suppliers that allow the apparel-maker to procure fabric in smaller quantities and with shorter lead times. This supplier must draw on production lines and sourcing arrangements that provide it with a range of response times, from short-cycle production capacity for products with high demand variability to lines or sourcing arrangements that create larger production runs at lower costs for items with low demand variability. But most important, it must have a managerial system capable of coordinating these elements on an ongoing basis.<n>Based on our observations of apparel suppliers, coming up with the money for new technologies and practices seems to be less of an impediment than altering basic management conceptions about using these technologies for planning and production. Many of the business units in our sample have adopted specific practices without changing their approach to using them together to compete in an integrated channel. They continue to draw on traditional conceptions of planning, production, and sourcing—in other words, they still think in terms of large orders of their products, placed months before delivery is expected. Needless to say, these business units have not fully benefited from the investments they have made.<n>Suppliers in most consumer industries now face lean retailing pressures or its equivalent. Many are taking steps to adapt to the changed requirements placed on them. One example is the restructuring beginning to appear in automobile distribution. Traditional auto retailing focuses on selling product lines in production quantities that were largely determined in advance of distribution. The system therefore placed tremendous pressure on auto dealers to sell the enormous finished goods inventory found in a car lot. In contrast to this traditional retailing model, BMW announced in 1997 an effort to restructure its U.S. dealers by allowing consumer customization of car purchases through the use of multimedia computer systems. By allowing customers to design their own cars, BMW dealers hope to reduce their finished goods inventories.23<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch14.txt
As long as only one or two retailers required rapid replenishment, manufacturers could get away with this type of solution. But it didn’t take long before most retailers wanted orders for basic apparel items replenished this way and they became very demanding. As an increasing number of suppliers are dancing to the demands of rapid replenishment, they are finding it a complex tune. Manufacturers suddenly have much more to do than just make clothing—they are being asked to do work previously done by the retailer, such as picking and packing the order for each store from the retailer’s warehouse. Each store’s order has to be put in a separate carton, labeled with its own bar code, and accompanied by an advance shipping notice. Moreover, retailers want an order to arrive at their distribution center at an exact time. If the truck is late, the driver often has to wait until the end of the day to unload, if allowed to do so at all. Deliveries made a day late are sometimes refused and sent back.<n>Such retail requirements have certainly put substantial pressure on apparel manufacturers to change their own practices. Chapter 5 described some of the basic changes many manufacturers are making to stay in the game with lean retailers. But even if lean retailing has led to suppliers’ wide-scale adoption of bar codes and EDI-related capabilities, divergent production strategies among suppliers have emerged. Conceivably, two business units could each meet the same lean retailing requirements yet have very different internal practices and performance. One could raise finished goods inventories substantially (like the dress-shirt manufacturer described above); the other could make crucial operational changes to reduce manufacturing lead times. However, in light of the growth of rapid replenishment, our research predicts that the performance of these two units will vary over time, with the supplier that has implemented flexible planning and short-cycle production processes coming out ahead. By investing in these practices, apparel suppliers have the potential to satisfy lean retailing performance standards without bearing the costs of greatly expanded inventory in their own operations. From our standpoint, holding high inventories to meet rapid replenishment demands is strictly a short-term strategy for manufacturers.<n>The increasing emphasis on rapid replenishment raises a related question: can offshore manufacturers meet retailers’ requirements for such short delivery lead times and so many services? More specifically, what are the characteristics of products for which inexpensive, long lead-time production is preferable to more costly production with extremely short lead times? The models and analyses presented in this chapter help shed light on this critical question.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt
On ﬁnishing high school, Sarah chose a religiously aliated college of the same denomination as that of her “alternative” family. The year after her college graduation, Sarah married a devout classmate, entering into a culture in which family life was pivotal. Six years later, Hannah started college, but for her the road to maturity was rough. She had diculty concentrating, earned uneven grades, and accumulated so many incompletes in courses that the university prohibited her from reenrolling until she wrapped up her “unﬁnished business.” Frustrated with Hannah’s undirectedness, her mother withdrew ﬁnancial support and insisted that she get a job. Hannah’s full-time waitressing soon became both an obstacle and an excuse for lack of progress in her studies. “I was at sea,” Hannah recalled. “I didn’t have any conﬁdence in myself, and I didn’t think I could do anything. So I started visiting Aunt Eva and Uncle Charlie, who lived three hours away.”<n>“We hadn’t known Hannah well while she was growing up,” Eva continued, “so we were surprised but delighted when she started coming on weekends. It didn’t matter what we were doing—birthday celebrations, dinner with friends, outings to movies and plays, shopping excursions, or leisurely breakfasts; Hannah hungered to be part of our family. During those times, she asked lots of questions about our work and home lives, and also about her parents, especially their early history: ‘Was my mom close to her mom?’ ‘Did you know my mom and dad when they were in college?’ ‘What was my parents’ wedding like?’ I described these and many other earlier events. We also did our best to convince Hannah that believing in herself grows out of trying hard, taking risks, and following through. We talked about how important it was for her to return to school, helped her think through a change of major, and advised on time management and study skills.”<n>Hannah completed her degree the following year. In a letter she wrote to Eva and Charlie shortly after her graduation, she attributed her turnabout in motivation and self-conﬁdence to the connection, forged through dialogue, with her aunt and uncle:<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
Patricia Preciado Martin, born and raised in Arizona, has written extensively about the folklore and traditional past of the Mexican people of Arizona. She has collected oral histories and folktales from elderly Mexican Americans, many of them born in Arizona or Sonora, Mexico. These oral histories nostalgically narrate the lives of men and women born at the turn of the century, describing the rural way of life on cattle ranches and the early city life of Tucson.<n>Thomas Sheridan has written a social history of the Mexican people of Tucson from 1854 to 1941, thoughtfully showing the social and cultural changes that occurred to the Tucsonenses after the coming of the Anglo Americans. The religious and cultural life of the community is carefully researched and impartially presented. A very good description of the foods prepared by Tucson’s Mexican restaurants is provided in the work of Suzanne Myal. An early publication of Arizona folklore is a collection of songs published in 1946 titled Canciones de Mi Padre, by Luisa Espinel. An exhibit at the University of Arizona Museum of Art reviewed by Amy Kitchener shows the continuity between home and community folk arts. A recent article by Josiah Heyman presents a social history of Douglas, Arizona, presented through the oral histories of residents of that city during the first decades of the twentieth century.<n>References Campa 1979; Espinel 1946; Griffith 1985, 1988, 1993, 1995; Heyman 1993; Kitchener 1997; Martin 1983, 1988, 1992, 1996; Medina 1975; Myal 1997; Sheridan 1986; Sheridan and Noriega 1987; Tales Told in Our Barrio 1984<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt

Aztlán takes a prominent place in murals, folk art, and folklore, and it continues to appear in Chicano literature today, as it has for over thirty years, in poetry, short stories, novels, and essay anthologies. The title of one of Rudolfo Anaya’s novels is Heart of Aztlán, published in 1979; Miguel Mendez wrote Pilgrims in Aztlán first in Spanish in 1974, later translated to English in 1992; and Alurista has a poetry collection titled Floricanto en Aztlán, published in 1971.<n>Aztlán is the Chicano homeland, especially for those coming of age during the 1960s and 1970s, who wanted to create a cultural space that they could call their own. For Chicanos born in the United States, Mexico is not home, but neither is the United States, so Aztlán is looked upon as the mythical homeland. The affiliation with Aztlán also reaffirms the Chicanos’ identity as mestizos (people of mixed ancestry), as members of the indigenous population of the New World. Chicano writers explore the various meanings of Aztlán in an anthology edited by Rudolfo Anaya and Francisco Lomelí titled Aztlán: Essays on the Chicano Homeland.<n>References Anaya and Lomelí 1989; Barrera 1988; Bierhorst 1990; Chavez 1984; Leal 1995; Valdez and Steiner 1972<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt
Robe’s collection of New Mexico legends contains thirty-four variants of the devil-at-the-dance tale. Although the legends in this collection are from rural northern New Mexico, collected in the 1950s and 1960s, we find contemporary versions of the devil-at-the-dance tales in south Texas and in Baja California from the 1980s. Limón and Herrera-Sobek discuss versions of the tale circulating in nightclubs and discotheques among urbanized young people.<n>Of course, not everyone believes such stories. Martin’s book contains a story by a man born in 1904, who says his friend played a trick on his community in Tucson by coming to a dance dressed in black, with a fake rooster foot. Eventually someone noticed his foot and yelled, “The Devil! The Devil!” The narrator says he was there when his friend played the trick, so he doesn’t believe in the legend (50).<n>References De Leon 1982; Glazer 1984,1994; Herrera-Sobek 1988; Limón 1994; Martin 1983; Robe 1951; Robe ed. 1980; West 1988<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
Mexican workers recruited from Mexico under the Emergency Farm Labor Program known as the Bracero Program, which was in effect from 1942 to 1964. The word bracero comes from the Spanish word brazo (arm), which is used, as English uses “hand,” to mean “laborer.” In the same way bracero commonly means a man who works with his hands, a laborer, and is used when speaking of all farm and agricultural workers. There was a shortage of farm laborers during World War II, and this program offered an answer to that problem, although some braceros also worked on the railroad. Until only recently bracero was applied to any Mexican farmworker, and is often used interchangeably with words like “wetback” or “greaser.” The number of workers brought from Mexico ranged from a low of 4,180 in 1942 to a high of 62,091 in 1944. It is estimated that by 1947 nearly 220,000 braceros had worked in the United States under this program. It continued even after the war, and between 1955 and 1959 over 480,000 braceros were still working in the United States. Some have compared the Bracero Program with legalized slavery, and the impact on the perception of the Mexican farmworker by American agribusiness has been to foster contempt and disdain. Many braceros chose not to return to Mexico when their contracts ended and -instead stayed and hid from la migra, the feared Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).<n>Many Chicanos of the Southwest and Midwest are descendants of braceros who came to the United States and stayed, never returning to Mexico. The bracero experience has been written about in novels and depicted in numerous movies, and although the image presented is often a negative one, like other Chicano folk heroes the bracero has become an archetype of the culture. He is in the company of the historical mestizo character of Yo soy Joaquín, the revolutionary figure of Joaquín Murrieta, the mythical pachuco, the stately learned persona of Dr. Paredes, the gentle leadership of César Chávez; the bracero is the universally exploited farmworker, the campesino of the world. Many corridos (ballads) describe the experience of coming to work in the agricultural fields of the Midwest and the Southwest. Maria Herrera-Sobek -describes the prototype of the bracero, as represented in countless corridos, in her book The Bracero Experience. In Mexico the experience was written about from the perspective of those who returned, as in such books as Aventuras de un Bracero, by Jesus Amaya Topete, published in 1949 and reprinted several times, and in the United States the novel Macho! by Edmund Villaseñor, published in 1973.<n>References Acuña 1988; Galarza 1964; Gutiérrez 1995; Herrera-Sobek 1979, 1993b, 1998; Madrid-Barela 1975; Nelson 1971; Paredes 1993<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
Although not a trained folklorist, Arnold Rojas writes of the vaquero (cowboy) culture of California, especially in the San Joaquin Valley at the turn of the century and into the first third of the 1900s. He describes the life of the Mexican vaqueros, how their lives were spent working on large ranches like the Tejon Ranch and the Kern County Land Co. Their lives were very narrowly focused on cattle and ranch life and they all spoke mostly Spanish. In his reminiscences of vaquero culture and of the impact Mexican Sonorans had on California, Rojas shows a side of Chicano culture not commonly known. Born in California, where his mother and grandmother were also born, it is clear he loved the life he lived. He writes of La Llorona and Joaquín Murrieta, and of Tiburcio Vásquez, who once gave food to his grandmother and mother when they were fleeing from the gringos in Los Angeles.<n>There are no overall written accounts or collections of the oral traditions and folklore of the early Californios as we have of the Hispanos of New Mexico. In Angustias de la Guerra, Ord’s Occurrences in Hispanic California, she describes some customs, but her work was not intended to preserve for history the way of life of the Californios. Glimpses of customs, games, dances, theater, and other traditions can be found in the writings of early western travelers, although these were often depicted prejudicially and with a lack of historical context. Spanish-language newspapers from the late nineteenth century exhibit folk customs and traditions. The folklore collected from Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the twentieth century, even if it’s from a third- or fourth-generation Chicano, generally will be folklore from Mexico transplanted to California since the turn of the century by immigrants fleeing a revolutionary war, or those coming to work in the agriculture fields. Of course it could also originate in New Mexico or Texas, since there has been much migration into California by Chicanos from those states. Folktales, jests, folk songs, corridos (ballads), and customs related to religious and secular holidays, foods, and other folk traditions found in contemporary California will have a lot in common with those found in other southwestern states and with Mexico. Chicano students have taken an active interest in folklore in the last twenty years, and archives established at the University of California at Berkeley and Los Angeles hold growing collections of many genres of Mexican American folklore. There are published collections from the 1970s and 1980s of folk medicine rituals and folk narratives collected primarily from Mexican immigrants in the Los Angeles area, but there is still much fieldwork to be done in this area.<n>See also Espinosa, Aurelio Macedonio<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chC.txt
Luminarias (Bonfires)<n>Not to be confused with farolitos, luminarias are small bonfires, and the custom of lighting them dates back to the Roman history of Spain. These small fires are built in New Mexico to celebrate La Noche Buena, Christmas Eve, and to light the way for the announcement of the birth of the Christ child. One family may light three luminarias in front of their home, one each for Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, while another may light twelve, one for each of the twelve apostles. It is believed luminarias originate from the huge bonfires built in pre-Christian times to celebrate rituals to the gods and goddesses. Also in ancient times shepherds built fires to keep themselves warm and to scare off the wolves. This tradition continued in New Mexico with the shepherds’ fires to illuminate the way for the coming of Jesus Christ. They are not as well known as farolitos in contemporary American popular culture, and one often finds farolitos mistakenly called luminarias, and magazine articles describe how to make them, especially during the Christmas holidays.<n>References Anaya 1995a; Brown 1978; Ortega 1973<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
A god, one of the major deities of the Aztecs. Quetzal is a Nahuatl word referring to a bird found in Central America, and coatl means “snake,” so Quetzalcoatl means a “feathered serpent,” and this god is often called the Plumed Serpent. Stories about him indicate that he was an earthly hero, a light-skinned man, who acted as the ruler of the Toltecs for some time. In one legend Quetzalcoatl is sent to the underground to get the bones of the ancients. After the end of the Fourth Sun (an Aztec era), when the ancient people have been drowned or changed into fish, the spirits decide he should go seek the bones in order to start a new race. He must try three times, overcoming many obstacles, before he succeeds in bringing the bones to the sky. They are ground to a powder and placed in a bowl by the goddess Cihuacoatl. The other gods shed blood into the bowl and humans are born. Quetzalcoatl discovered corn, which he brought for the new humans to eat. He saw an ant bringing a kernel of corn from inside a mountain, and he changed himself into an ant and followed it. Lightning was used to split open the mountain to bring the corn to the people. He left the Toltecs to return to his home. It just happened that Quetzalcoatl promised to return in the same year that Hernán Cortés landed in Veracruz. It was to the Spaniards’ advantage to use the Indians’ belief in Quetzalcoatl’s return. Cortés was well received because he was thought to be Quetzalcoatl and the conquest of the Aztecs by the Spaniards was legitimized.<n>Quetzalcoatl is one of the better-known Aztec gods and has been greatly idealized by the moderns, including Chicanos. His image has influenced artists, writers, philosophers, and painters for hundreds of years. As the celestial dragon, he is patterned after the rattlesnake, a common mythical creature in Mesoamerica. This dragon has come to symbolize the Chicanos’ early heritage and has been embraced by Chicanos, especially those coming of age in the 1970s. Quetzalcoatl can be found in the literature, murals, and graphic art reflecting Chicano culture and the Chicano movement of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1970 an American Indian and Chicano college was started in northern California with the name Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl College. This college was still in existence in the year 2000 and has struggled to maintain a curriculum that meets the needs of both Indian and Chicano students. Deganawidah was the name of the chief of the Iroquois Federation, and after the college was given his name, it was learned there was a common belief that the name could not be mentioned publicly. Since that time the college has become known as D-Q University.<n>References Bierhorst 1990; Brundage 1979; Carrasco 1992; Lafaye 1983<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chQ.txt
This is the European conception of constitutional freedom. When the German Basic Law of 1949 declares human dignity to be the foundational value of the constitution, the implications run through all relationships that may come into being. This “third-party effect” means that private individuals are bound to respect the human dignity in each other, precisely as they are bound not to subject each other to relationships of involuntary servitude or, during Prohibition, not to sell each other alcoholic beverages. Today, men and women must avoid sexual harassment on the job, even though in this case the “third-party” effect arises not directly from the Constitution but from federal legislation.<n>An activist tripartite conception of government requires funding. Fighting a major military campaign to suppress the Southern insurrection required a stronger financial base than the government had needed up to that time. The war drove up spending from the customary 2 percent of the gross national product to 15 percent. (By comparison, in the early 1990s, government spending represented 20 percent of the GNP.)5 With no place left to turn, a Republican Congress approved the first income tax in 1862. By 1865, the income tax generated over 20 percent of federal revenue, the balance coming from tariffs and reintroduced excise taxes.<n>The Civil War income tax lapsed in 1872, and when the direct tax against income returned to the national agenda in the 1890s, the times were different. The disputes took on the tones of class struggle. This time, it was the Democrats who favored the tax as a measure of social justice. Many of the wealthy who were affected by the modest 2 percent tax denounced the measure as socialist. Almost immediately after the tax’s introduction, a challenge under the original Constitution made its way to the Supreme Court, where five of the nine justices were convinced that any form of income tax violated the prohibition against direct taxes not in proportion to the census.6 Progressive politics as well as the government’s demand for revenue generated a coalition that supported a constitutional amendment to reverse the decision of the Supreme Court. By 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment found the necessary three-fourths vote for ratification, and the income tax became a basic tool of modern state finance.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt
The question of exploitation and manipulation of consent has shifted from the economic to the sexual arena. That is why the peep show case so beautifully captures our concerns about equality and human dignity. The right to enter the romantic and sexual relationship of one’s choosing is surely an important dimension of freedom. It includes the right to marry the person of one’s choice, to choose and act upon a sexual orientation, gay or straight, to enjoy (within appropriate limits) reproductive freedom, and to say “no” to sex if one is so inclined.<n>The law of rape has become a major battleground of American law. The central question has become whether nominal consent to sexual relations constitutes actual consent, deep agreement in the heart. As in the economic context, power tends toward exploitation. The problem is particularly acute when the party seeking sexual favors—usually a man—is in a position of authority over his desired partner. The most hotly debated cases are spun from skepticism about whether nominal consent actually generates the kind of voluntary relationship that should be regarded as an expression of freedom rather than of exploitation. The same is true of regulation of sexual harassment on the job. If the boss promises advancement or threatens disadvantaged treatment on the job, the appearance of complete and voluntary participation is readily undermined. So far, in the name of equality, we are willing to tolerate rather intrusive regulation of dating practices in corporate or university settings, but one can sense a coming backlash favoring the principle that students old enough to vote should be old enough to make a responsible decision about their sexual lives.13 Making it a crime or private action for damages for coworkers or costudents to have sexual relations would surely violate the right to sexual autonomy now recognized as an aspect of liberty protected by the due process clause.14<n>The problem of exploitation in apparently voluntary sexual relations has long been with us. In the late nineteenth century, the problem was whether the Mormon practice of polygamy should be regarded as protected as liberty and the free expression of religious conviction. Those who defended the institution, as provided in the accepted Mormon religious doctrines of the time, cited its social benefit of caring for all the women and children in a society in which the available men had fallen victim to the hardships of settlement and warfare. The critics, by contrast, claimed that the choice of the women in these cases is not really free and voluntary. John Stuart Mill, a great advocate of liberty, sided with the critics of polygamy.15 Western governments have had no qualms about prohibiting the practice, sometimes for parochial religious reasons, sometimes out of solicitude for women who are subjected to an institution that arguably diminishes their status. The Mormons sued, thinking they had the kind of argument that eventually prevailed in the Lochner case. In 1878, the Supreme Court upheld the conventional view that the prohibition represents permissible intervention by the state to protect the weak against entering into exploitative relationships.16 Many voices today argue that this decision was wrong. The freedom to choose any form of domestic arrangement one wants should prevail against the state’s concern to protect people against their own potentially bad choices.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt
In 1869, four years after the war was over, the Louisiana legislature passed a statute that brought home the persistence of a dispute about economic freedom that reached back to the earliest stages of modern European and English legal history. The great virtue of the case was to remind the legal community that many issues of freedom had nothing at all to do with the war of solidarity to preserve the nation and emancipate the slaves.<n>At the time, about one thousand people in New Orleans were engaged in the business of receiving shipments of livestock from boats coming down the Mississippi, slaughtering the animals and packing the meat for distribution. The 1869 Act claimed to concentrate the management of the livestock and meat packing trade into selected areas. It provided that animals could be unloaded and slaughtered exclusively on the properties owned by two of the many enterprises engaged in the trade. All the butchers in the area had the right to use these facilities, but they had to pay a prescribed fee to the patented monopoly. The ostensible reason for consolidating these activities was “to protect the health of the city of New Orleans.”8 The Act was entitled: “An act to protect the health of the city of New Orleans, to locate the stock-landings and slaughter-houses, and to incorporate the Crescent City Live-Stock Landing and Slaughter-House Company.” The Act named seventeen people who were entitled to exercise the privileges of the incorporated company, and, further, it imposed fines for every violation of the patent. The excluded local butchers were enraged. They thought as landowners they were entitled to use their land to house and slaughter animals as the market required. They wanted nothing more complicated than to pursue their trade as they saw fit on their own land.<n>On the assumption that the legislature had acted in good faith, that there was no graft involved in vesting this authority in the Crescent City Slaughter-House Company, the controversy seemed to be an easy one—at least by contemporary standards of public regulation. This was a reasonable exercise of the state’s “police power,” its general authority to promote the common good. The single slaughterhouse was in the nature of a public utility—much like a telephone or electric company that has received a franchise from the government to provide service to a particular area. In describing the case, Charles Black dismissed the controversy as trivial.9 The complaint by the butchers should not even have generated a serious constitutional question.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
The telltale beginnings of that larger story are beginning to be formulated. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Agency has had a long program in “exobiology,” the search for life elsewhere in the universe. Among its well-known interests are SETI, a search for extraterrestrial life, and the Mars probes. Over the past three decades, a sustained eVort has included a wealth of experiments aiming at discovering the abiotic origins of the organic molecules that are the building blocks of known living systems.<n>In the summer of 1997, NASA was busy attempting to formulate what it came to call “astrobiology,” an attempt to understand the origin, evolution, and characteristics of life anywhere in the universe. Astrobiology does not yet exist = it is a field in the birthing process. Whatever the area comes to be called as it matures, it seems likely to be a field of spectacular success and deep importance in the coming century. A hint of the potential impact of astrobiology came in August 1997 with the tentative but excited reports of a Martian meteorite found in Antarctica that, NASA scientists announced, might have evidence of early Martian microbial life. The White House organized the single-day “Space Conference,” to which I was pleased to be invited. Perhaps thirty-five scientists and scholars gathered in the Old Executive OYce Building for a meeting led by Vice President Gore. The vice president began the meeting with a rather unexpected question to the group: If it should prove true that the Martian rock actually harbored fossilized microbial life, what would be the least interesting result?<n>The room was silent, for a moment. Then Stephen Jay Gould gave the answer many of us must have been considering: “Martian life turns out to be essentially identical to Earth life, same DNA, RNA, proteins, code.” Were it so, then we would all envision life flitting from planet to planet in our solar system. It turns out that a minimum transit time for a fleck of Martian soil kicked into space to make it to earth is about fifteen thousand years. Spores can survive that long under desiccating conditions.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
Rather than using the estrogen receptor and seeking a peptide estrogen mimic that binds the estrogen receptor, George Smith used a monoclonal antibody molecule as the analogue of the receptor and sought a hexamer peptide that could bind the monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibody technology allows the generation of a large number of identical antibody molecules, hence George could use these as identical mock receptors. George found that, among the twenty million diVerent phage, about one in a million would stick to his specific monoclonal antibody molecules. In fact, George found nineteen diVerent hexamers binding to his monoclonal antibody. Moreover, the nineteen diVerent hexamers diVered from one another, on average, in three of the six amino acid positions. All had high aYnity for his monoclonal antibody target.<n>These results have been of very deep importance. Phage display is now a central part of drug discovery in many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The discovery of “drug leads” is being transformed from a diYcult to a routine task. Not only is work being pursued using peptides but also using RNA and DNA sequences. Molecular diversity has now spread to the generation of high-diversity libraries of small organic molecules, an approach called “combinatorial chemistry.” The promise is of high medical importance. As we understand better the genetic diversity of the human population, we can hope to create well-crafted molecules with increased eYcacy as drugs, vaccines, enzymes, and novel molecular structures. When the capacity to craft such molecules is married, as it will be in the coming decades, to increased understanding of the genetic and cellular signaling pathways by which ontogeny is controlled, we will enter an era of “postgenomic” medicine. By learning to control gene regulation and cell signaling, we will begin to control cell proliferation, cell diVerentiation, and tissue regeneration to treat pathologies such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and degenerative diseases.<n>But George Smith’s experiments are also of immediate interest, and in surprising ways that will bear on our later discussion of autonomous agents.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
The model autonomous agent system is displaced from equilibrium by the persistent addition of the two DNA trimers, 5’GGG3’ and 5’CCC3’, the removal of the DNA hexamer, and the persistent shining of photons, hv, from the outside. The chemical reaction network occurs under “chemostat” conditions. This means that all molecular constituents of the system are treated mathematically as if they were in a real well-stirred container to which the trimers and photons are added at a constant rate. In addition, the hexamer molecular components are removed from the system at an adjustable rate that holds their internal concentrations constant whatever the rate of reproduction of hexamer may be.<n>The autonomous agent system reproduces more eYciently with the couplings of the DNA trimer-hexamer system to the PP and electron cycles than in the purely exergonic case in which the DNA trimer-hexamer system operates alone. We measured eYciency thermodynamically as the conversion of available free energy coming into the system from the photon source into the excess hexamer with respect to the undriven steady-state rate of reaction concentration of the hexamer.<n>Figure 3.5 shows the results of our simulations. In these simulations of the chemical reaction network, there are, as noted, thirteen kinetic constants. We carried out computer selection experiments not only comparing the autonomous agent to a nude exergonic DNA trimer-hexamer system, but also computationally mutating the kinetic constants by small amounts and computationally evolving autonomous agents to reproduce with higher thermodynamic eYciency.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Figure 3.5 shows the results of our simulations. In these simulations of the chemical reaction network, there are, as noted, thirteen kinetic constants. We carried out computer selection experiments not only comparing the autonomous agent to a nude exergonic DNA trimer-hexamer system, but also computationally mutating the kinetic constants by small amounts and computationally evolving autonomous agents to reproduce with higher thermodynamic eYciency.<n>Our results demonstrate first and most important that autonomous agents operating displaced from equilibrium and utilizing a work cycle can be more eYcient at using the available free energy coming into the total system in reproducing hexamer DNA than in the absence of the coupling of the trimer-hexamer DNA system to the PP and electron-photon work cycle system. Thus, the autonomous agent as a whole, including its work cycle, reproduces DNA hexamer more rapidly than would the trimer-hexamer exergonic system alone. In short, and also important, being an autonomous agent coupling an autocatalytic system with a work cycle is of selective advantage compared to being a merely exergonic autocatalytic system.<n>Second, just as in the glycolytic positive-feedback case, our autonomous agent model, for appropriate values of the kinetic constants, can undergo sustained temporal oscillations of PP and other concentrations. The oscillation of PP from high concentration to low concentration then back to high concentration during the work cycle is analogous to the expansion and recompression oscillation of the working gas in the Carnot engine’s work cycle.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Where did all this come from, this measuring of useful displacements from equilibrium from which work can be extracted, the devices coupling to such measurements, and the extraction of work used to build up new kinds of devices that measure new kinds of displacements from equilibrium to extract work in new ways? Yet a biosphere, actually constructing itself up from sunlight, water, and a small diversity of chemical compounds, does all this over evolutionary time. The biosphere does achieve persistent measuring of displacements from equilibrium from which work can be extracted and does discover “devices” to couple to those energy sources such that work can be extracted.<n>And since the biosphere does this, and the biosphere is part of the universe, then the universe does it. This coming into existence of self-constructing ecosystems must, somehow, be physics. Thus, it is important that we have no theories for these issues in current physics. The stark fact that a biosphere builds up this astounding complexity and diversity suggests that our current physics is missing something fundamental. A biosphere becomes complex, the universe becomes complex. I will argue that the very diversity and complexity of a biosphere begets its further diversification and complexification. I strongly suspect that the same is true of the universe as a whole. The universe’s very diversity and complexity begets its further diversification and complexification.<n>After exploring Maxwell’s demon, I will ask a physicist’s question, What is work? Physicists have an answer  work is force acting through distance  given by a single number, or scalar, representing the sum of the force acting through the distance. But it will turn out that in any specific case of work, the specific process is organized in some specific way. Work is more than force acting through distance; it is, in fact, the constrained release of energy, the release of energy into a small number of degrees of freedom. It is the constraints themselves  with, as Phil Anderson points out, a kind of rigidity  that largely constitute the organization of the process. But  and here will be the hook  in many cases it takes work to construct the constraints themselves. So we will come to a terribly important circle, work is the constrained release of energy, but it often takes work to construct the constraints.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
The link to information due to Shannon comes next. Shannon was concerned with transmitting signals down wires. He brilliantly thought of the minimal signal as a yes or no answer, hence representable as the binary or , now called a “bit.” Shannon considered the entropy of a source sending a prospective signal as the set of possible messages that might be sent, where each message was to be weighted by the probability of actually being sent. He thought of receiving a message as reducing the entropy, or uncertainty, about which message was actually sent, given the initial set of possible messages. Thus, Shannon wound up reinventing the same mathematics that covers entropy. Here there is an ensemble of messages, and each can be thought of as occupying a volume in a space of possible messages. Each message is sent with some probability from the source. So Shannon took the logarithm of the volume in message space occupied by a message and multiplied it by the probability that that message was sent from the source. If the fraction of the total volume of message space occupied by a given message is “p,” then the logarithm of this volume is “logp” and the probability of that volume is “p.” Thus, the logarithm of a probability of a message multiplied by that probability itself is “plogp.” The sum of these “plogp” terms for the total set of messages at the source is the entropy of the source. Reception of a signal reduces the receiver’s uncertainty about what is being sent from the source, hence is a negative entropy. Shannon’s information measure is, thus, just the negative of the normal entropy measure.<n>The link established by Szilard between information and Maxwell’s demon is, roughly, that the discrimination by the demon that a given gas molecule is faster or slower than average and whether it is coming from the left or right box (hence, whether he should open or close the flap valve) constitutes a measurement that extracts information about the gas system, hence, lowers the uncertainty about the gas system, hence, lowers the entropy of the gas system.<n>Importantly, there is an implied observer in discussions about entropy. Thus, a physicist might typically say that the entropy of a system is due to “our coarse graining” of the system into (arbitrarily) chosen macrostates. If “we” had more information about the microscopic states of the system, our more refined coarse graining would reduce the entropy of the system from our point of view. Indeed, there has been some genuine confusion about the role of the observer and his more or less arbitrary choice of coarse graining in the concept of entropy.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
But this is an essential issue. Only certain features of a nonequilibrium system will, upon measurement, reveal a displacement from equilibrium that can actually be used to extract work. Other features, if measured, are useless with respect to revealing a displacement from equilibrium that can be used to extract work by any given specific system.<n>It is important to stress that we have here a sense of “useful” outside the context of autonomous agents. Useful measurements detect features of displacements from equilibrium that reveal energy sources from which work can be extracted. Only some measurements are actually useful in this sense in a biosphere, a geosphere, or a galaxy. These useful measurements participate together with the coming into existence of devices that extract work used to build further measurement and work extraction structures, in the gradual buildup of the diversity of structures and processes of a biosphere, a geosphere, a galaxy, or a universe. This buildup is part of why the universe is complex.<n>I believe that we can ultimately create a statistical theory of the probability of the generation of specific novel processes, structures, and energy sources; propagation of measurements; detection of useful sources of energy; and couplings of structures and processes to the energy sources to extract work and progressively build up still further new structures, energy sources, and processes  all as a function of the current diversity of structures, transformation processes, and measuring and coupling entities. Such statistical theories should be constructable, for example, for a giant cold molecular galactic cloud or early prebiotic planet or, most fundamentally, the expanding universe as a whole. We need a theory in which symmetry breaking begets further symmetry breaking in a progressive construction of diversifying structures and processes. Chapter , with its discussion of the origin of self-reproducing molecular systems as a phase transition to supracritical behavior in catalyzed chemical reaction graphs as a function of molecular diversity and the ratio of reactions to molecular species, is a partial prototype for such a statistical theory. A further partial prototype is present in chapter , with its discussion of autonomous agents as self-reproducing physical systems that do successfully measure displacements from equilibrium and do successfully evolve to couple exergonic and endergonic reactions to achieve completed work cycles. The vast and richly coupled network of coupled exergonic and endergonic reactions in the global ecosystem is proof positive of such propagating construction in the physical universe. In chapter I will discuss a quantum analogue to such a theory, in which complex quantum systems that couple tend to “decohere” irreversibly to classical behavior and thereby progressively build up complex classical structures.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
Fine, but we built the tiny windmill. How do such coupling structures that link identified sources of energy to the carrying out of work come to exist in the universe on their own? There is not the slightest doubt, for example, that such entities have come into existence in our biosphere as autonomous agents have coevolved over the eons. Thus, a host of new questions are raised. In the beginning, presumably, the universe was simple, homogeneous, featureless, almost isotropic. Now it is vastly complex. In the beginning, the early Earth had a paucity of complex molecules, chemical reactions, linked structures and processes. Now it is vastly complex.<n>The universe as a whole has witnessed the coming into existence of novel structures and processes; so too has the biosphere. Where no dierence existed, dierences have come into existence. In a general sense, the persistent emergence of dierent structures and processes is the persistent breaking of the symmetry of the universe. What feeds this apparent propagating diversity? One aspect may be the following. Consider again the case of the box with the flap valve and something simpler than a fan, say a small mica flake suspended in the cooler of the left and right boxes. If the flap valve “be opened,” a wind from the hotter to the cooler box is transiently present. This is a simple displacement from equilibrium, and a simple device, the mica flake, will be made to quake, hence, extract mechanical work.<n>Now consider an antiferromagnetic material. Such material has magnetic dipoles that, when adjacent, prefer to point in opposite directions. The north pole of one prefers to be adjacent to the south poles of its neighbors. If arranged along a straight line, an antiferromagnetic material has two equivalent lowest-energy “ground” states, NSNSNSNSN versus SNSNSNSNS. Now consider a subtle displacement from one of these lowest-energy states, say NNNSNSSSN. Here, rather than alternating N and S poles being next to one another, runs of NNN and SSS occur. The energy of the total system would be lowered if the dipoles flipped orientation to come closer to one or the other of the ground energy states. Therefore, at a suciently low temperature such that the system can flow to and remain at a ground state, the NNNSNSSSN antiferromagnet is displaced from its lowest-energy equilibrium state, and in principle, work could be extracted from this system as it relaxes to one of the two lowest-energy states. But notice now that, compared to detecting the direction of the wind by the mica flake, a rather complex and subtle measurement must be made by any measuring device that is to detect the subtle displacement from equilibrium and that any device that is to use that displacement to extract work must be correspondingly subtle. Roughly speaking, a measuring device must be of similar complexity to the antiferromagnet. Indeed, a second antiferromagnet could serve as a measuring device if it were near its own ground state and brought into proximity to the first antiferromagnet. The runs of SSS and NNN in the first antiferromagnet, brought close to a second one with ground state runs of SNS and NSN could cause the first antiferromagnet to flip closer to its ground states. Hence, the measuring-detecting-extracting device must be more structurally and functionally complex than a mere mica flake considered as a thin planar crystal.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
In short, there appears to be some positive relationship between the diversity and complexity of structures or processes and the diversity and complexity of the features of a nonequilibrium system, which can be detected and measured by the detecting structure to identify a source of energy, then couple to the source of energy and actually extract work. If there is a relation such that diverse and complex features of nonequilibrium systems useful as sources of energy can best be detected by equally diverse and complex structures, then there appears to be some generalized “autocatalytic” set of processes in the universe since the big bang, and in a biosphere, by which nonequilibrium systems of increasing complexity and diversity arise, provide sources of energy of increasing subtlety and complexity, and in turn are detected and extracted by the increasingly complex structures that arise.<n>Of course, to hint the above is to hint an initial answer. At least in our bio-sphere, the cumulative coevolution of autonomous agents has, in the past four billion years, achieved precisely such a diversification. Cells and organisms have achieved astonishingly ramified and subtle detectors that measure sources of energy, plus coupling devices, that extract work and use it to build rough copies of themselves. Thus, metabolism in cells is a coupled web of chemical reactions among simple, complex, and very complex organic molecules, ranging from carbon dioxide to proteins comprised of thousands of amino acids. The catalytic sites of enzymes possess high stereospecificity  that is, shape specificity  for the transition state of the substrate(s) of the reaction. Such reactions may release energy or may couple the release of energy to the endergonic synthesis of other molecular species. Cells are replete with equally stunning receptor complexes decorating their surfaces. Binding a ligand to a receptor may trigger a complicated sequence of reactions leading to the synthesis of hundreds of dierent molecular species. But the high specificity of molecular interactions in a cell are precise examples of the coming into existence of richly nuanced, structurally and procedurally complex molecular processes that measure and detect sources of energy, and couple those sources to the carrying out of further chemical, electrical, or mechanical work.<n>A coevolving biosphere achieves exactly the emergence of such self-constructing diversifying organization. Whether galaxies, planetary, stellar, or other systems do as well is an open question. Again, one senses the possibility of a statistical theory of the propagation and self-elaboration of such linked structure transformational systems.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
Now in normal physics, say, college-level physics, all these specifications occur at the beginning of the problem, in the statement of the initial and boundary conditions. The billiard balls are in such and such positions on the billiard table, the cue is moved with such and such velocity and strikes a given ball in such and such a position with such and such velocity. Now, given Newton’s calculus, let us compute the forward trajectory of the balls on the table. So the puzzle of where the initial and boundary conditions come from, and the specific coupling of cue to ball, are “hidden” in the initial and boundary conditions of “the problem” and in how Newton taught us to calculate. In short, the problem of the organization of the process in any specific case of work is hidden from view in the initial and boundary conditions of the usual statement of the physical problem. In eect, this choice is the choice of the “relevant” degrees of freedom, which is equivalent to the choice of the boundary conditions versus the dynamical variables of the system.<n>But an evolving biosphere is all about the coming into existence in the universe of the complex, diversifying ever-changing initial and boundary conditions that constitute coevolving autonomous agents, with their changing organization of capacities to measure and detect energy sources, and couple those detected energy sources to systems that sometimes extract work. We will return in a subsequent chapter to ask if it makes sense to try to finitely prestate the initial and boundary conditions of a biosphere. I will claim that it does not. I will claim that we cannot finitely prespecify the configuration space of a biosphere, hence, we cannot finitely prespecify the initial and boundary conditions of a biosphere.<n>If so, then we cannot hide the issue of the organization of work processes in a statement of the initial and boundary conditions of the biosphere. We must grapple with the emergence and propagation of organization itself on its own terms. If so, perhaps there is something amiss with the way Newton taught us to do science in his spectacular career.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
A Physics of Semantics?<n>ach of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory. Each is tentative and incomplete, pointing but not fully adequate. Yet, I persistently hope, it is better to light one candle against   .   .   .   what? the darkness? the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before? There are grounds, reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries, to doubt a physics of semantics. We are on shaky ground. Yet when the first hard frost comes, when the birches have been swung, their crimson leaves scattered carelessly, when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn, long-legged, knowing how winter is thin, when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams, small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where, perhaps, something new is to be found.<n>We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent, able to manipulate the universe on its own behalf  the egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady, powerful flight. The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom, and perhaps more than the vaunted quark. But autonomous agents, we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf, we to whom “intentionality” and “purpose” are so inevitably attributed by our common languages, we are, by my definition of autonomous agents, also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties. If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a useful  or more, a proper  definition of life itself, then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where “purpose” is ascribed by all of us to one another.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt
I cannot buy Shannon’s view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent. If not, then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamics  perhaps a set of water-filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways. The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding.<n>But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner, that sequence of events seems laden with semantics. If only the bacterium could tell us: “Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me? I’ve run into that one before! I ducked under a boulder, and he never sensed me. I made it home. Pass me some more glucose please, Martha.”<n>I will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories, for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and, therefore, cannot deduce that which will unfold. Thus, among other things, we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds. Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing. I too know the risks, including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from “intentional talk” to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question. But patience. Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold, but we also cannot even translate  in the sense of necessary and sucient conditions  from legal talk to normal intentional talk, let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound-wave forms monitored and masses at space-time lines as a description.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt

The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agent  say, an early bacterium  is somehow linked with the embodied know-how of that agent in making a living, or failing to make a living, in its world. The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered, context-dependent set of causal implications of the event, or signal, in question.<n>“For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of the shoe, the horse was lost; and for want of the horse, the rider was lost,” more or less, said Benjamin Franklin. The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt
Downward causation is real and nonmystical. There are now more old tires along roadsides than wagon wheels. The car has replaced the Conestoga.<n>I distrust a reductionism that sees causality as bottom up. In what sense is Tomasina nothing but the atoms and their locations and motions in three-dimensional space of which she was comprised? The concepts of atoms in motion in three-dimensional space do not appear to entail the concepts of an autonomous agent, self-consistent constraint construction, release of energy, propagating work tasks, and the closure of catalysis, tasks, and other features that constitutes the propagating organization that is an autonomous agent or a coevolving ecology of autonomous agents. In one sense, of course, there is nothing but the atoms in motion in three-dimensional-space in Tomasina. But the historical coming into existence of life in the universe, of autonomous agents, and of the propagating organization that is Tomasina and her bioworld is nowhere accounted for by Newton’s laws. What, after all, do Newton’s laws of motion have to do with a suYcient account of Tomasina’s jump to the left rather than the right? Is Tomasina as a whole organism part of the furniture of the universe? Yes.<n>Adaptations, Exaptations, and the Impossibility to Finitely Prestate the Configuration Space of a Biosphere<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
The remaining three of the four candidate laws apply versions of this idea. Even law above is a version. Selection tunes communities of cells to the phase transition between order and chaos where a power law distribution of damage avalanches on all scales propagate across the system.<n>The claims coming next are not my own work, but derive from fine eorts by ecologists Stuart Pimm, Mack Post, and more recently, Bruce Sawhill and Tim Keitt, making use of work by physicist Scott Kirkpatrick and his colleagues.<n>First, the early work of Stuart Pimm and Mack Post, done in the late s: They were concerned with community assembly of organisms into a local ecosystem (Figure .). They ignored long-term coevolution and made use of the Lotka-Volterra equations. These equations basically say, for any species, what other species it eats, how readily it turns the eaten prey into an extra copy of itself, and how fast it reproduces on its own without eating. Plants, herbivores, and carnivores are readily represented.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
Moreover, general competitive equilibrium, seen as a culmination of one central strand of economic theory, is too limited. Insofar as economics is concerned with understanding the establishment of prices at which markets clear, general competitive equilibrium was a masterpiece. But insofar as economics is or should be concerned with how and why economies increase the diversity of goods and services, the reigning theory is a nonstarter. And since the growth in wealth per capita over the past million years is deeply related to the growth in the diversity of technology and goods and services, contemporary economics is clearly inadequate.<n>We need a theory of the persistent coming into existence of new goods and services and extinction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera.<n>But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. With the horse went the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. With the car came paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. Most firms die young, some last a long time. We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
And to my economist colleagues: Consider the economy as forever becoming, burgeoning with new ways of making a living, new ways of creating value and advantages of trade, while old ways go extinct. This too is the proper subject for your study, not just allocation of scarce resources and achievement of market-clearing prices. The economy, like the biosphere, is about persistent creativity in ways of making a living.<n>I find it intriguing to note certain parallels from our prior discussion of autonomous agents and propagating organization. At the level of molecular autonomous agents, I made the point repeatedly that work is the constrained release of energy and that autonomous agents do carry out work to construct the constraints on the release of energy such that the energy is released along specific channels and such that specific couplings of nonequilibrium energy sources to propagating organization arise. Think then of the role of laws and contracts, whose constraints enable the linked flow of economic activities down particular corridors of activities. The web of economic activities flows down channels whose constraints are largely legal in nature. The coming into existence of the enabling constraints of law is as central to economic development and growth as any other aspect of the bubbling activity.<n>Robust Constructibility<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt

About this time, Card, the lead Secret Service agent, the President's military aide, and the pilot were conferring on a possible destination for Air Force One. The Secret Service agent felt strongly that the situation in Washington was too unstable for the President to return there, and Card agreed. The President strongly wanted to return to Washington and only grudgingly agreed to go elsewhere. The issue was still undecided when the President conferred with the Vice President at about the time Air Force One was taking off. The Vice President recalled urging the President not to return to Washington. Air Force One departed at about 9:54 without any fixed destination. The objective was to get up in the air-as fast and as high as possible-and then decide where to go.<n>At 9:33, the tower supervisor at Reagan National Airport picked up a hotline to the Secret Service and told the Service's operations center that "an aircraft [is] coming at you and not talking with us." This was the first specific report to the Secret Service of a direct threat to the White House. No move was made to evacuate the Vice President at this time. As the officer who took the call explained, "[I was] about to push the alert button when the tower advised that the aircraft was turning south and approaching Reagan National Airport."<n>American 77 began turning south, away from the White House, at 9:34. It continued heading south for roughly a minute, before turning west and beginning to circle back. This news prompted the Secret Service to order the immediate evacuation of the Vice President just before 9:36. Agents propelled him out of his chair and told him he had to get to the bunker.

The Vice President entered the underground tunnel leading to the shelter at 9:37.<n>Once inside, Vice President Cheney and the agents paused in an area of the tunnel that had a secure phone, a bench, and television. The Vice President asked to speak to the President, but it took time for the call to be connected. He learned in the tunnel that the Pentagon had been hit, and he saw television coverage of smoke coming from the building.<n>The Secret Service logged Mrs. Cheney's arrival at the White House at 9:52, and she joined her husband in the tunnel. According to contemporaneous notes, at 9:55 the Vice President was still on the phone with the President advising that three planes were missing and one had hit the Pentagon. We believe this is the same call in which the Vice President urged the President not to return to Washington.

If you prefer the antiques of tomorrow there are also many stores full of “collectibles,” — most popular at present are turn-of-the-century light fittings, taps, and door furniture.

Before WWII, Amsterdam was a major center for the buying and polishing of diamonds. The industry was decimated by the loss of many Jewish families who ran the major diamond houses, but a slow recovery ensured its survival. Today the industry is known for the quality of its polishing and of the expertise of many independent traders. Five main diamond houses are responsible for buying and polishing stones. They sell to smaller dealers but also sell to the public. You’ll be able to see diamond polishers at work before you buy. You can choose from loose stones or finished pieces of jewelry. There are five main diamond houses in the city: Amsterdam Diamond Centre on Rokin (corner Dam), Coster Diamonds on Paulus Potterstraat facing Museumplein, Gassan Diamonds on Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat, Van Moppes on Albert Cuyperstraat, and Stoeltie Diamonds on Wagenstraat.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhatToDo.txt
Olhão’s fishing port is worth a look. The fishermen of the town have a reputation for hardiness — some used to earn a living in cod waters as far off as Newfoundland. During the past two centuries, however, some of the sailors have turned away from fishing and instead, taken to the cargo trade between Portugal and North Africa. This relatively recent link with the neighboring continent may have been the inspiration for the local North African style of architecture. In any case, it developed long after the Moors had left the Algarve.<n>You’re unlikely to see a boat coming in from another continent, but you are guaranteed the hustle, bustle, sights, smells, and sounds of one of the Olhão fish market, one of the Algarve’s best (the town is especially famous for its mussels and other shellfish). Adjacent to the voluminous market buildings are small, well-tended parks, one of which boasts several splendid benches decorated with blue-and-white azulejos. Just beyond the park on the other side, ferryboats depart regularly in summer for the barrier-island beaches of Armona and Culatra just offshore. These lovely, undeveloped beaches are the jewels of the coastline between Faro and Tavira.<n>A little farther along the coast, at Fuzeta, is another popular beach. There is some holiday development here, but as yet only on a small scale. Fuseta itself is little more than a creek of gaily-painted boats bobbing at anchor, while in the background local workers rake salt crystals into small white mountains punctuating the saline delta.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
Back on the mainland, a turn-off of the main road east (EN-125, still!) of Tavira leads a small number of visitors to a perfectly enchanting little whitewashed village overlooking the sea. Pretty Cacela Velha can’t have more than 100 inhabitants. It has an 18th-century church, a telephone booth, a cemetery, an old well, and a handful of well-tended, blue-and-white houses festooned with flowers. Below the town, along a spit of sand that’s part of the Ria (estuary), are a few moored fishing boats.<n>East of here lies the fledgling resort of Manta Rota, a former fishing village, and the high-rise canyons of Monte Gordo. The reason behind all this development is a long sandy beach, which stretches undisturbed for some 10 km (6 miles) between the two resorts and is backed by pine trees and dunes. Although the last in a long line of Algarve beach resorts (or the first, if you’re coming from Spain) is not, by a long shot, the coast’s most attractive, the beach and watersports facilities at Monte Gordo are enough to attract and entertain many serious sun-seekers. By night the casino is the focus of attention.<n>The Guadiana River, which runs into the Atlantic 3 km (2 miles) east of Monte Gordo, served as a natural frontier for 2,000 years, forming the boundary between the Roman provinces of Lusitania (Portugal) and Baetica (southern Spain). This explains the strategic importance of Castro Marim, a former fortress town rising from the flatlands to command the broad river. For five centuries its primitive castle-fortress was occupied by the Moors. After the Reconquest it became the home of the new Military Order of Christ (succeeding the disbanded Knights Templars). Look for the inscription inside the main entrance proclaiming that Prince Henry the Navigator, who was a governor of the order, once lived here. These days the castle itself is in need of defense and restoration, and although it may no longer be of any military value, its broad, unpolluted marshlands do attract large numbers of wading birds. The area is protected by the National Parks service and is very popular with birdwatchers.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt

Athens has a beautiful downtown area but it is one of the largest cities in Europe, and it also has an industrial element mostly based around the southern and eastern suburbs. Incongruous among the landscapes of oil refineries and factories you’ll find historical gems to explore. Ten kilometers (6 miles) west of Athens is the Monastery of Daphni (soon to be linked with the downtown area by Metro extension) built on the site of an earlier Temple of Apollo. Founded in the fifth or sixth century a.d., the site was refurbished and extended in the 11th century but sacked and abandoned before being occupied by Orthodox monks in the 16th century. Restoration took place after WWII and again in the 1960s. The pretty Byzantine church (c1080) has a stone-and-tile dome exterior but is famed throughout Greece for the fantastic mosaics that decorate the interior, particularly that of Christ Pantocrator in the main dome.<n>Through this same industrial area runs the Sacred Way that linked Athens with the city of Eleusis. In ancient times the way was lined with shrines and tombs, which are now and again brought to light when redevelopment takes place. Eleusis was home to the Sanctuary of Demeter and the Eleusian Mysteries — a series of complex and enigmatic rituals only performed by initiates of the order. The order thrived from the Mycenaean era to the coming of Christianity. Annual celebrations to Demeter took place in Athens each September, with a public festival and a secret religious rite that transformed chosen followers into initiates of the secrets. A procession would leave Eleusis and walk along the Sacred Way entering Athens via the Sacred Gate at Kerameikos (see page 49) before proceeding to the Acropolis.<n>In Eleusis the sacred way led directly to the Sanctuary of Demeter and a large Temple of Artemis with a forecourt where the initiates would gather in preparation for the procession. A great Propylaia marked the entrance to the town  — a copy of that at the Acropolis. The Precinct of Demeter lay in a walled complex, and its inner sanctum, the Periklean Telesterion, where only initiates were allowed to enter, sat within the temple. You will also find the remains of more mundane structures such as the Bouleuterion and gymnasium. A museum on site displays extremely good artifacts found among the ruins.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
They call it the “happiest place on earth,” which may be why more visitors now come here than to any other single attraction anywhere. Surprisingly, four of every five are adults. Disney World is styled as the most complete vacation destination in existence, offering sports, nightlife, sightseeing, shopping, camping, hotels, and restaurants all connected by an extensive, easy-to-use transportation network.<n>The heart of the complex is the 100-acre (40-hectare) Magic Kingdom, where it’s easy to confuse who’s real and who’s artificial. This is where the park began and where you can meet all your favorite Disney characters — you’ll be able to shake hands with Mickey and get a hug from Goofy. The park has seven sections, including Main Street, USA, with its re-creation of turn-of-the-century America facing the much photographed Cinderella Castle. For a gentle overview of the entire Magic Kingdom, try the aerial tramway at dusk as the lights are coming on.<n>Out of Walt Disney’s last dream of an Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow grew EPCOT Center, just south of the Magic Kingdom. This multimedia extravaganza’s projection of our planet’s past and future has all the high-tech displays and virtual-reality of your dreams. Take a ride through the human body, or dash around the world in an afternoon as you step into re-creations of 11 countries.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
Goa Lawah<n>Considered one of Bali’s oddities, the Bat Cave and its temple are hemmed in by souvenir stalls, hawkers, sash dispensers, donation collectors, ticket sellers, and, for most of the day, parked tour buses. Once past this obstacle course, you’ll see the cave mouth and a seething mass of leathery bats clinging to the rock face, here and there dropping off, circling and then coming in to land again. They can’t all find a place in the cave, so some hang outside in broad daylight. If you are staying anywhere near, perhaps at Candi Dasa, you might time a visit here for dusk. That’s when the bat colony pours out of the cave like a liquid black stream and wheels away into the distance to feed on the myriad insects of the tropical night.<n>On the foreshore near the Bat Cave, a few people scratch a living by harvesting salt. Seawater is first concentrated by solar evaporation in shallow pans and then transferred to the hollowed-out halves of palm tree trunks to crystallize.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Museums and Excursions<n>After 1945, many works originally in the eastern half of the city or Potsdam were transferred to a new home in the west. After reunification, Berlin’s museums were again in a state of flux, but this situation is now coming to an end as collections settle into their permanent homes.<n>Berlin has a huge number of museums, but luckily most of them are arranged in convenient groups. Museums are superbly laid out, and most provide leaflets (usually in German, but often in English and French) with detailed information about the exhibits; you will find honesty boxes for payment freely dotted about. For addresses and opening hours, see pages 66–67.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
While you’re on the north side of town, take a drive around the Hollywood Hills for a superb view of the city. The classic Los Angeles cruise is along Mulholland Drive. On a clear day you can see Long Beach, 25-miles (40-km) away across the vast, sprawling metropolis.<n>Another great viewpoint is the Observatory in Griffith Park (off Highway 5). Fans of James Dean will recognize the Observatory — it was the scene of the climax of Rebel Without a Cause. The panorama from the terrace on a clear day is fantastic, from the spiky skyscrapers of downtown to the distant Pacific. Griffith Park is the biggest city park in the United States. It sprawls across the eastern Hollywood Hills and is criss-crossed with drives and hiking trails. Toward sunset is the best time to go, just as the city lights are coming on.<n>Westside<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
Ethnically diverse, Toronto is Canada’s largest city, home to 4.3 million people. Hard to believe that this gleaming citadel of big business and the good urban life was a malarial swamp in the 1790s. Muddy York once could be recommended only by its commanding position on Lake Ontario, from which Fort York guarded the troublesome American border. Today, the mud is neatly paved over, the mosquitoes have flown elsewhere, and the Americans are less trouble than they used to be. Yonge Street, the military highway that founder John Simcoe thrust north from the fort to Lake Simcoe, starts out now as downtown Toronto’s main commercial artery. Its intersection at the elegant shopping thoroughfare, Bloor Street, is the fashionable hub of the city.<n>Following John Simcoe’s military grid pattern, Toronto’s main arteries run from the lakefront north: Spadina and University Avenues, Bay, Yonge, and Church Streets; and east–west: Front, King, Queen, Dundas, College-Carlton, and Bloor Streets. Our sightseeing itinerary starts down at the waterfront and works north through the business district to the chic shopping and museum area. As an alternative, especially if you have children, you may prefer to start downtown, around Union Station, and visit the other sights to the north before coming back to relax among the recreational attractions of the waterfront. Getting around the city is quite simple, but while downtown, park your car and walk or use the buses or subway.<n>Waterfront Area<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The Central Area<n>There are several approaches to Las Cañadas National Park and Mount Teide. The park is well sign-posted from the road via La Orotava, but if you are coming from the north, then the most picturesque route is via La Esperanza. The small town soon gives way to a lush forest of giant pines and eucalyptus trees. Four km (21⁄2 miles) south at Las Raíces is where Franco met with his co-conspirators in 1936 (see page 20). An obelisk in the forest commemorates the event. As the road gains altitude and temperatures fall, the views become ever more spectacular. The Mirador Pico de las Flores looks out over to the southeast and the Mirador de Ortuño offers a panorama of the northern coast. Highest of all at over 2,000 m (6,562 ft), Mirador las Cumbres reveals Teide in all her glory.<n>The entrance to the National Park is El Portillo de las Cañadas, where there is a visitor center (open daily 9am–4pm). If you wish to walk in the park, pick up a leaflet or ask for information about the daily guided walks. Note that during winter the environment can become quite harsh, and you should never undertake walks without consulting staff at the visitor center first. At this point it is quite likely that you will be in the clouds; temperatures are very low, and in winter there may well be snow on the ground. The landscape becomes very lunar-like; it was around here that some of the filming for Planet of the Apes took place. The ascent to the top of Mount Teide can be made by climbing, or by the new cable car (teleférico), an eight-minute ride (open daily 9am–4pm, admission: 2,500 ptas, r15.03). Most visitors choose the cable car, but it’s worth noting that even after leaving the cable car it is still a good climb to the summit at 3,717 m (12,195 ft). However, if you really want to venture that far you have to go in person and with a photocopy of your passport, to the Office of the Parque Nacional del Teide (Calle Emilio Calzadilla, 5, 38002 Santa Cruz de Tenerife). Even then, there is a daily limit of just 50 people, for conservation sake, allowed up the last 200 m (219 yards) to the summit. Once there, you should be able to count off all the other Canary Islands and, on a good day, see North Africa. Impressive as Teide is, it is basically no more than a peak on the edge of a giant volcano which long ago erupted or imploded. Left behind is the vast Caldera (volcanic crater) which is most apparent from the area known as Los Roques. Los Roques are a group of giant, flamboyantly shaped lumps of volcanic rock rising out of the crater; often visited and photographed.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
By 1500 b.c. the group that came to be known as the Maya settled in an area which stretched from the Pacific coast to the southern Yucatán, taking in modern-day Guatemala, Belize, the western parts of El Salvador and Honduras, and the Mexican state of Campeche. In the succeeding centuries they migrated into the northern Yucatán — what are now the modern Mexican states of Yucatán, Quintana Roo, and part of Tabasco.<n>Though their antecedents are still shadowy, they were much influenced by the Olmec. They developed and refined the Olmec calendar and counting system, and improved their building practices. The whole Yucatán peninsula witnessed the flowering of classic Mayan civilization and a society of great sophistication; with its magnificent pyramids, temples, and palaces decorated with wall paintings and carved low-reliefs, a written language of hieroglyphics, and complicated medical procedures to heal the injured or the sick. Mayan astronomers tracked the movements of the heavenly bodies, predicting eclipses and marking the times for the planting of the new corn. In fact, corn came to symbolize life for the Maya — in their myths of creation, mankind was formed from lumps of maize dough. Elaborate rituals grew up around the preparation of the milpas (cornfields) and the planting and harvesting of the crop whose success depended on the coming of the annual rains. These rituals were undertaken by a small number of initiates who controlled the knowledge of the Maya. Because the region has no surface rivers, rain was a precious resource and the Maya saw any stock of water, such as the limestone water holes or cenotes, as holy places. The rain god Chaac was a very important deity, whose image can be seen at every Mayan site.<n>But there was a dark side to this sophisticated society. The Maya viewed their gods not as benevolent guides but as changeable spirits in need of constant appeasement. To incur the wrath of the gods would result in drought, a loss of crops, and certain starvation. To keep the gods happy, the people offered sacrifices at their great pyramid temples. The ceremonies were overseen by a powerful caste of high priests. Grain and animals were used, but the gods came to demand more, and a cult of human sacrifice grew. The Maya went out on raiding parties, taking hostages from the surrounding lands to use in their bloody ceremonies. The murals and reliefs at Mayan cities tell gory tales of beheading and the tearing out of human hearts to appease the lords of the underworld. Archaeologists dredging the Sacred Cenote of Chichén Itzá have recovered dozens of human skeletons, thought to be the remains of victims sacrificed to the rain god.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt
From 1966 to 1976, China was convulsed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Millions of young Red Guards went on the rampage, and the whole country set about memorizing the maxims in Mao’s Little Red Book. Thousands perished and much of China’s cultural heritage was destroyed as a vestige of feudalism. Changes came in quick succession in the 1970s. The US president, Richard Nixon, visited China in 1972, thus normalizing relations between the two countries. In early 1976 the widely admired prime minister, Zhou Enlai, died. Eight months later, in September, death came to Chairman Mao himself.<n>Mao’s widow, the one-time film actress Jiangqing, and her close associates (the so-called Gang of Four) were arrested, tried, and imprisoned for encouraging the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. Thousands who had suffered during the fervid 1960s and 1970s, including the forceful pragmatist Deng Xiaoping, were rehabilitated. At the same time as Mao Zedong’s portraits and slogans were being removed from billboards and schoolrooms, a new flexibility was coming to the fore. Top priority was now assigned to the modernization of China’s underdeveloped economy. This opened the way for major scientific and commercial exchanges with the West. And foreign tourists soon began flooding into the country to see the splendors that had been inaccessible for so long.<n>In 1992 “Supreme Leader” Deng Xiaoping set into motion a rapid Westernization of China’s economy. Deng’s death and Hong Kong’s return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 together marked another new era in the creation of a New China, this time as an economic superpower designed to rival the US and Europe in the 21st century.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-History.txt
Open boats ferry visitors from Leshan to the site of the Great Buddha (Dafo). Whether seen from the river or, later, from the hillsides, the world’s largest seated Buddha is an impressive spectacle. Carved from the cliffside by a monk starting in the year 713, its height is 71 m (233 ft). The statue’s feet are so big that a hundred people can sit on each instep.<n>The boats tie up some distance from the Buddha and passengers climb from the shore to Dark Green Temple (Wuyousi), with its view of Mt. Emei, the gate to Western Paradise. A pathway and suspension bridge lead back to the Great Buddha. There, the Stairs of Nine Turnings wind steeply down one side of the statue to the feet. Another honeycombed stairway carved from the cliff leads back up the other side, coming out level with Buddha’s massive crown, where you have a view of the Buddha’s serene and knowing countenance. More temples and caves lie on the road back to the boat landing and the buses to the sacred peak.<n>Mt. Emei<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Cayo Largo, an island 25 km (15.5 miles) long and the most easterly of the Archipiélago de los Canarreos, might be your Caribbean paradise — if all you’re looking for is a dazzling white beach and clear blue seas. Other than the miles of beaches, there’s not much else of consequence here except mangrove, scrub, and half a dozen comfortable hotels with a full program of entertainment and watersports. Turtles nest in the sand at one end of the island. At the other you can go sailing, diving, or deep-sea fishing or take a boat trip to Playa Sirena, an incomparable strip of sand a 10-minute boat ride away, where lobster lunches are available. Cayo Largo, with its captive tourist audience, is considerably more expensive than the mainland.<n>Some package tourists spend the whole of their holiday on Cayo Largo. Those with low boredom thresholds might consider coming for only a daytrip or for overnight trips on half-hour flights from Havana and Varadero.<n>The Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Youth) is Cuba’s largest offshore island, some 50 km (31 miles) in diameter, but not its prettiest. It is said to have been the location for Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island; pirates once buried their booty here. The island received its jaunty name in the 1970s, when as many as 22,000 foreign students (mainly from politically sympathetic African countries) studied here in no fewer than 60 schools.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
Boudhanath has attracted Tibetan monks and pilgrims for centuries, and over the years a Tibetan and Sherpa community has grown in this area. Many of the people you will see circumambulating Boudhanath are Tibetans rather than Nepalis, and those with long braids and wild costumes are usually Tibetans who have only recently arrived in Kathmandu. Also keep an eye out for pilgrims who prostrate themselves repeatedly as they circle the stupa.<n>Where Swayambhunath is cluttered with monuments in different styles, at Boudhanath there are no other temples to distract pilgrims. There are, however, dozens of shops specializing in Tibetan antiques and other Tibetan souvenirs. Pilgrims coming from Tibet, as well as local refugees, supply the shops that ring the stupa with the city’s best selection of Tibetan antiques. There are also shops filled with bronze Buddhist statuary, silver ornaments, prayer wheels, and brass “singing bowls.”<n>Patan (Lalitpur)<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
Musée de l’Orangerie<n>A pavilion in the corner of the Jardins des Tuileries is home to the outstanding Walther-Guillaume Collection and Monet’s renowned Nymphéas (Water Lilies). Masterpieces by Cézanne, Renoir, Utrillo, Rousseau, Modigliani, Picasso, Derain, and Soutine hang in the upstairs rooms. For his great Nymphéas murals, Monet himself chose the two ground-level oval rooms as those most likely to recapture the experience of coming across the water lily ponds at his home in Giverny (see page 76).<n>Musée Picasso<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
Farther north along the coast, just south of the small town of Aguada, is a monument commemorating the landing of Cristóbal Colón on the island in 1493. Though no one is really sure of the precise landing site (Columbus is renowned for having been less than accurate in documenting his landing sites), the small park with its column and naïve paintings depicting Spanish colonization serves its purpose well.<n>North of the town of Aguadilla, traveling out toward the airport and Rafael Hernandez air force base, are a series of fine bathing and surfing beaches. The most famous is Crash Boat Beach, named after a shipwreck that happened just offshore. The beach is always busy, but the most exciting stretch is the northern section, where the fishing boats rest. Most hours of the morning there are ships coming ashore with their meager, but extremely fresh, catch. The boats are brightly colored and carefully tended to ensure that they are always in peak condition — not one is splintered or sun-bleached.<n>Traveling back along the northern coast there is little to draw the eye. Inland however, it’s a different story. South of the busy town of Arecibo are a number of attractions that would make a fine day-trip from San Juan (none is more than a 90-minute drive from the capital).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Ixtapa also has its share of trendy shops and boutiques, plus lively nightlife, and refined dining. A bicycle track begins at the marina, continues around the golf course, and heads on towards the northern beach of Playa Linda.<n>The first beach in Ixtapa, coming from Zihua is Playa Hermosa, which can only be accessed through the Westin Hotel. This small beach is dramatically framed by rock formations. The surf varies seasonally from minimal to quite rough, and has become somewhat of a private beach for Westin’s guests.<n>Playa Linda is located 12km (8 miles) north of Ixtapa. This is a long beach with golden sands that seem to stretch endlessly to the north. It is the primary out-of-town beach, with water sports equipment rentals, fishing charters, and horseback riding. The ferry to Isla Ixtapa leaves from the jetty located on the southern end of Playa Linda.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt
