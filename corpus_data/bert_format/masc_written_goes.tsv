ared by many sociologists and psychologists. [SEP] Children who grow up in war-torn regions are known for having similar views -- war is perceived as a normal part of existence, violence as a natural way to solve disputes. [SEP] In a weaker sense, the same message is projected to American children, who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to one another, but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media messages about how "the enemies of freedom" are punished. [SEP] Moore's film was made before the dead bodies of Qusay and Uday Hussein were paraded on national TV. [SEP] Americans were gloating over this demented corpse show: "They squealed like little piggies too, so you'll have to make do with 'oink, oink, squeeeeeeeallll' for their last words. That	goes	for your grandson Mustafa too, by the way. Still think fucking with the U.S. was a good idea, Sammy?" [SEP] Mustafa was 14 years when he was killed. [SEP] Americans cheer the killing of children, yet wonder why their own children grow up to be more violent than those in other nations. [SEP] It is paradoxical notions like this one which Moore's film seeks to address.	#essays#	essays_A_defense_of_Michael_Moore.txt	go	written	masc_written	4
There is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene. [SEP] The bank does exactly what it advertises: It hands out guns from its vault to those who open an account. [SEP] The silly criticisms of the scene obscure the real obscenity of the situation: a bank handing out guns to its customers, higlighting the utter laxness of how Americans deal with deadly weapons and a love of firearms that borders on the religious. [SEP] 2) The Lockheed-Martin interview. [SEP] This is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often, and it also the most inaccurate. [SEP] First, the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly.

The "visual of a billboard and a narration" is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together, when in reality, it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver. [SEP] Moore is a professional filmmaker -- he concentrates on maximum impact of each of the statements he cites, and to accomplish that effect, uses subtle interludes instead of long-winded introductions. [SEP] This is a common technique, but because conservative readers are not familiar with the basics of filmmaking, they believe critics who claim that he is "distorting" the interview. [SEP] What he does is standard filmmaking practice. [SEP] The same	goes	for the interview which follows. [SEP] Moore's critics would expect us to have him quote Heston in his entirety, have him present fully the PR that the NRA has used to justify its rally in Denver for reasons of "balance". [SEP] The NRA was fully aware of the scandal it would cause through its rally and decided to push on because they believed to have enough media support to successfully do so. [SEP] They were right. [SEP] You claim that there was "no way to change location, since you have to give advance notice of that to the members, and there were upwards of 4,000,000 members." 10 days are more than enough to give advance warning of a change in location or date, had the NRA really wanted to. [SEP] It is probably correct that their primary reason for not doing so was to save money, not to 	#essays#	essays_A_defense_of_Michael_Moore.txt	go	written	masc_written	4

“I don’t know how it is that you don’t have a boyfriend. I don’t know how there isn’t an army of gus following you around, doing what ever your lovely heart desires,” Kyle continued, Janice’s face was about as red as can be imagined, yet getting redder. [SEP] “But then I think, it does make sense because she’d never like that,” he was really picking up the pace now, “She’s not the type that	goes	around fluanting what she’s got and taking advantage, which makes you even perfecter. I don’t think that’s a word but it doesn’t really matter right now.

ly from Arthur's gate. [SEP] He walked the wheel-ruts, hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust. [SEP] Some quarter-mile from Arthur's gate, he halted, confronted by a halloo. [SEP] "Nathan?" he called out to the empty road. [SEP] The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree. [SEP] "I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today," said Nathan, "so I thought I'd wait here for you." [SEP] Nathan's lanky frame, dressed in a loose, tan jacket, fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton. [SEP] His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface, infusing his body with a rakish energy. [SEP] "So, Allan," said Nathan, unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside, "how	goes	life for the quintessential American author?" "I wouldn't know," replied Allan dryly, before continuing in another tone entirely. [SEP] "I destroyed another story last night, Nathan."	#fiction#	fiction_The_Black_Willow.txt	go	written	masc_written	4

Hearing this the leopard halts his attack in mid stride, and he slinks away into the trees. [SEP] "Whew", says the leopard. [SEP] "That was close. That dog could've nearly had me." [SEP] Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching all this from a nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard. [SEP] So, he	goes	chasing after the leopard. [SEP] But the dog saw him heading after the leopard with great speed, and figured that something must be up.	#jokes#	jokes_jokes4.txt	go	written	masc_written	4

Old Hermit An old guy who'd spent his whole life as a recluse in the desert	goes	to visit a friend. [SEP] He'd never seen a train in his life, but on his way he happens upon a railroad track. [SEP] Standing alongside the track, wondering what the heck it was, he hears a loud whistle. [SEP] Looking around, he sees a train bearing down on him like something out of the Apocalypse. [SEP] The train just nudges him a glancing blow, but it still flips him into an arroyo, where his head smacks up against a rock and knocks him colder'n a witch's heart. [SEP] A while later he gets up, tenderly feeling the bump on his head and shrugging off the dust, and continues onto his friend's house, the whole time wondering what the devil that big darn thing was that nearly killed him.	#jokes#	jokes_jokes8.txt	go	written	masc_written	4
There's this guy who had been lost and walking in the desert for about 2 weeks. [SEP] One hot day, he sees the home of a missionary.

[SEP] Feeling better, the man asks the missionary for directions to the nearest town. [SEP] On his way out the back door, he sees this horse. [SEP] He	goes	back into the house and asks the missionary, "Could I borrow your horse and give it back when I reach the town?" [SEP] The missionary says, "Sure but there is a special thing about this horse. You have to say 'Thank God' to make it go and 'Amen' to make it stop." [SEP] Not paying much attention, the man says, "Sure, OK." [SEP] So he gets on the horse and says, "Thank God" and the horse starts walking. [SEP] Then he says, "Thank God, thank God," and the horse starts trotting. [SEP] Feeling really brave, the man says, "Thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God" and the horse just about takes off.	#jokes#	jokes_jokes8.txt	go	written	masc_written	4
