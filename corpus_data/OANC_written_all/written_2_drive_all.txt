Human Resources and Productivity Growth<n>The drive to gain advantage from economies of scale and the role of manufacturing technology in textiles have also affected the people who work in the industry. Ever since garment-making entered the factory system, the textile industry has been much more capital intensive than apparel. Today we estimate capital per worker in apparel at $2,000, while the figure for basic textile operations is several hundred thousand dollars. As a result, human resource practices in the two industries differ considerably.<n>For one thing, the textile industry’s machine operations involve a large number of distinct job classifications defined by the technology and production process; they fall within a narrow range of compensation, with the classifications of loom fixers, weavers, maintenance electricians, and machinists above that range. Because the textile industry has become so capital intensive, there are fewer jobs than in the past—but the people who remain are, on average, paid more than apparel workers; some lower-skill jobs, such as the picker tender opening bales of fiber, have now been automated out of existence. In 1950, average hourly earnings in textiles were $1.23 an hour compared with $1.24 in apparel. By 1980, textile hourly earnings had risen to $5.07 compared with $4.56 in apparel; in 1997, textile workers earned an average of $10.02 an hour, 21.5 percent more than the $8.25 an hour of those in apparel.38 Currently only 48 percent of textile employees are women, while women constitute 77 percent of apparel workers.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt

Damon acknowledges that economic constraints and other family pressures play a part in this youth disaection. But he places most blame on how contemporary children are reared. Child-centeredness, Damon explains, has become an excuse for a rudderless parenting and educational culture that makes few demands while fostering in children a stress-free, “feel-good” attitude in which children are told, ”You’re lovable,” “You’re great,” “You’re terriﬁc,” regardless of what they do. But because these messages have no basis in meaningful attainment, they are counterproductive. Sooner or later, children see through them, come to mistrust the adults who repeat them, and begin to doubt themselves.<n>Damon neither endorses the insensitivity of adult dominance nor the tumultuous reign of the child. Instead, he underscores that children are avid, active learners, but adults must cultivate their drive toward mastery. They must induce children to develop talents, skills, good values, and a sense of accomplishment through engagement not just in activities that are easy and fun, but in ones that are meaningful and challenging—that help them sustain eort in the face of diculty, overcome obstacles, and advance to greater heights.<n>As Damon’s message suggests, in building an eective vision of child development and child rearing, neither the child’s inner thoughts and feelings nor the role of adult guidance can be singularly extolled or wholeheartedly ignored. To do either leads parents and educators to become trapped in a false opposition, to vacillate, and to think in oversimpliﬁed ways about how best to help children realize their potential to learn and become personally and socially responsible.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
Imagination and Creativity<n>In addition to its contribution to many nonplay skills, make-believe can be examined on its own terms: as an imaginative activity that expresses salient aspects of the child’s inner cognitive and emotional life. In Vygotsky’s theory, the drive to fantasize and engage in role play does not fade away with childhood. Instead, he maintained, the imagination of later years is an internalized, condensed form of early childhood make-believe that can be considered play without action. We typically experience it as an elaborate stream of consciousness made up of mental images and silent self-talk that meanders along, remarking on new experiences, reﬂecting on the past, and predicting the future.50<n>By introducing fantasy elements into consciousness, this inventive private commentary probably helps us cope with the mundane, repetitive aspects of our daily lives. We resort to such ruminations while waiting; during long car trips or meetings; and at other monotonous or idle times. In this way, early make-believe fortiﬁes us with a mental tool that is vital for adapting to everyday life! And from time to time, we apply logical, adaptive thinking to this inner playfulness to harness it for culturally worthwhile purposes. The result may be a creative idea or product.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
A leyenda, a legend, is an oral narrative different from a folktale in that it is narrated as if the event described occurred in the recent past and the story is believed by the narrator to be true. There is often a supernatural element to the narrative, such as a person’s disappearance into thin air, yet it will be recited as having occurred in a specified locale. Often the narrator states where the story originated and explains that the events were observed by a grandmother, cousin, father, or friend. The names of persons and places in the narrative will be familiar to the audience. In Chicano oral tradition, stories about La Llorona, the Blue Lady, or Joaquín Murrieta can properly be called legends and almost always tell a story the audience wants to believe. The Chicano community’s cultural belief system is inherent in the narrative, otherwise the legend would not be recited and retold, again and again. There are hundreds of variants of the La Llorona legend, all narrated about known encounters with her, during the past 200 years. Her tragic story is believable, and one can say she is probably the quintessential legendary figure of the Chicano folk belief system.<n>The urban belief tale, sometimes just called an urban legend, is a subtype of the legend and is called such because it circulates among all classes and ages and reflects modern stresses and anxieties. It is not only found in urban centers but in rural regions as well. In addition to the legend of La Llorona (Weeping Woman), another widespread legend in Chicano folklore is the Vanishing Hitchhiker, although not always known by this name. A California folklore journal first carried an article about it in 1942, and a Chicano version appears in Miller’s narrative collection from Los Angeles with a date of 1939. The story usually involves a driver who picks up a hitchhiker, often late at night and often a young girl, and he drops her off at or near her home. She leaves something in his car, or he lends her a jacket or sweater, and the next day he returns to retrieve it and learns that she was a ghost, and has been dead for several years. Sometimes she is met at a dance, and asks a boy to drive her home, or she might be a nun, but the ghost is rarely a male. Brunvand calls it a classic automobile legend, and its prevalence has increased since cars became affordable to all social classes. Interestingly, the Vanishing Hitchhiker legend is one of the few narratives shared by both Anglo American and Chicano folklore. Mark Glazer discusses a collection of 152 variants from the Rio Grande Folklore Archive at Pan American University in Texas and states that the legend is “part of a culture which believes in miracles, mystery, and romance” (1987, 35).<n>See also Agreda, María de Jesus Coronel de; La Llorona; Murrieta, Joaquín<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
A low-rider 1969 Ford LTD called “Dave’s Dream” is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington D.C., the first and only low-rider car in the museum. From Chimayo, New Mexico, Dennis Martinez, Richard Martinez, and David Jaramillo worked on customizing the car, starting in 1975. It has two hydraulic pumps, with the batteries stored in the truck, that lift and lower the car and can make it rock from side to side and give it an appearance of dancing. Actually “car dancing” is an event held at low-rider car shows.<n>Within the low-rider subculture there exist several divisions of traditions. For instance, car clubs are an important aspect of the culture and a way to showcase cars in competitions. One of the oldest ongoing car clubs in Los Angeles is named the Dukes. Members of car clubs are referred to as “clubbers,” and they compete for trophies, ride in car caravans, and often participate in fund-raising events. “Cholos” are considered another group, less financially stable with more modern cars, less ornate, and likely more Mexicano in orientation. A third group, the “cha chas,” are Mexican immigrants, who drive the Toyotas and Volkswagens, and are a smaller group.<n>Low Rider Magazine was founded during the 1970s to provide a forum for low riders and the culture that surrounds low riding. Low Rider has been very instrumental in the widespread growth of low-rider car clubs, and “Low Rider Happenings,” throughout the Southwest. Low riding is looked upon as a very Chicano cultural phenomenon, yet it has spread to other ethnic communities. There are many non-Chicano car clubs, and the Japanese have also adopted it. Low Rider has been publishing a Japanese edition for the past four years and has organized low-rider car shows in Tokyo and Osaka. As a form of artistic expression and folk art, the customizing of low-rider cars by Chicanos is an expression of tradition and cultural pride.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
In this example, the servant chooses the condition of servitude. We know from the fate of many long-term prisoners that after a certain period they choose a life of dependence, free of the responsibility of caring for themselves. It is not impossible that someone might actually prefer the secure life of the slave to the anxious life of the free person who must care for himself.<n>There are two distinct grounds on which the law might sensibly prohibit the possibility recognized in Exodus. First, the claim might be that freedom and its blessings represent a great gift that no individual “made in God’s image” should be able to forfeit as though it were a disposable piece of property. Alternatively, the argument might be that in principle people have the right to choose to forego their freedom, but that in reality these choices are always influenced by personal necessities that becloud the choice actually made. This is especially true under market conditions, where the need for sustenance can drive people into relationships that they would not choose in and of themselves. It is clear that even the choice of the Hebrew slave discussed in Exodus can never be shown to be completely free. The legal arrangements also stipulate in the same passage that if during his period of servitude the slave acquired a wife or children, then he must leave them behind when he leaves his master’s service. Some purchased servants might decide to opt for permanent servitude simply because they cannot bear to live without their wives and family. The full text in the quoted passage reads: “I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out free.”12 The cruelty of subjecting him to the choice between freedom and leaving his family obviously means that his choice is not free in any meaningful sense.<n>Under modern capitalism there are many conditions that render choices less than fully free. Material necessity is the most obvious. But, as we have learned from the history of alcohol and cigarette consumption, advertising and peer group influence can lead people to develop habits that they later regret. The same is true of heroin consumption, which may readily develop into a condition of dependency in which the addict may enjoy the illusion of freely choosing not a hole bored in his ear but rather numerous telltale holes bored in his veins.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt
Therein lies a message for the politics of governmental intervention. There are times when we must rely on civil society to achieve our goals—sometimes with a slight nudge from government. Witness the turnaround that has occurred in the United States with regard to cigarette smoking. The government posted health warnings on cigarette packs, required airlines and governmental buildings to ban smoking, but did not try to follow the model of Prohibition or the drug laws. The policy of deferring to voluntary initiative has been more effective. A revolution in attitudes toward smoking has occurred, largely because people were free, in effect, to decide for themselves in their homes, offices, and other spheres of influence. They did not need the coercive force of government behind them.<n>For many, the limitations on governmental power represent a trivial and self-evident proposition. But those who believe in the power of government, as I do, should pay heed. And conservatives, who are generally skeptical of the power of government, would do well to ponder the analogies between Prohibition and the drive for prayer in the schools or the criminalization of flag burning. Of course, there are some areas, such as the protection of the victims of crime, where only the government can act. Of that problem there will be more to say later.<n>Allow me to take the Twenty-First Amendment out of order. After a decade of Prohibition, the country realized in 1933 that the government simply could not act upon its noble motives. The Constitution had to be amended once more, this time to countermand the Eighteenth Amendment. Some states, for example, Mississippi, retained Prohibition for many more years. As a colleague from ostensibly dry Mississippi once jibed, “Prohibition is better than no liquor at all.” The country as a whole finally decided, however, that a little liquor was more desirable than the costs to freedom in trying to achieve Prohibition.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
Since the Civil War, the United States has hardly lacked a strong sense of national patriotism. But the state has had to do little to further it. In the 1890s, the Pledge of Allegiance, our secular prayer to the flag, spontaneously spread across the country and became a standard part of the socialization process for all American children. There was little national hesitation about our wars of national aggrandizement against militarily weak opponents in Cuba and Panama. And the country joined enthusiastically in sending our doughboys overseas, in President Wilson’s words, “to make the world safe for democracy.” The generation that fought and won World War II is still with us, infusing in both blacks and whites a strong sense of a national mission well executed. The war in Vietnam was undoubtedly a setback for the spirit of patriotism. A whole generation—my friends and students—became skeptical about the use of military power. Yet, to my surprise and somewhat to my chagrin,14 a new cohort took up the sentiments of their grandparents and enthusiastically supported the questionable goals of the government in the Gulf War. As we were bombing Iraq, the country erupted again in a spontaneous display of unity and patriotic enthusiasm. Yellow ribbons appeared everywhere. It reminded one of the pledge that burst out a hundred years earlier, a paean to the flag in school houses around the country.<n>Civil society is a powerful medium, and when the public takes up the cause either of religion or of patriotism, its strength overshadows the feeble efforts of government to manipulate its opinions. Yet, in both fields—religion and patriotism—we face a constant challenge from those who are unsatisfied with the successes of civil society. They want government to join the action. Nowhere is this more evident than in the politics of schooling. We worry constantly, perhaps with good reason, that the young in America are growing up with the wrong values. They supposedly suffer from all the mistakes of their elders who promote violence on television and have permitted the country to be flooded with guns, which, as everyone knows, enable teenagers who go on rampages to gain a few hours of prime time news coverage. One wonders, however, whether it is an effective response for government to require, as suggested in one Republican initiative, schools to post the Ten Commandments on schoolhouse walls. This drive toward governmental intervention in the field of value formation has been nowhere more evident—and questionable—than the recently revived push for a constitutional amendment to protect the flag against protestors who want to burn it.<n>The commitment to the flag has surely been one of the stable and recognized provisions of our sub rosa constitution. We do well to cultivate reverence toward the flag, which coupled with national rituals like the pledge, instills sentiments of national loyalty in our children. Although patriotic sentiments toward the flag antedate the Civil War, we begin to find, in the early twentieth century, a duty of reverence toward the Stars and Stripes formulated as a legal issue. In 1907, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction for flag desecration of a beer manufacturer who printed the flag on his cans. Appropriating the flag for commercial purposes was considered disrespectful.15<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
Human Dignity<n>But civil society is not always to be trusted. Witness the drive toward a constitutional amendment to protect the flag against physical desecration. The amendment actually passed the House of Representatives in the summer of 1999, but it is not expected to command the necessary two-thirds vote in the Senate. When speech induces a sense of victimization in minorities and women, many academics in the United States and even more lawmakers abroad reach for the arsenal of legal remedies to show their compassion for victims. Two basic strategies present themselves. One technique trades heavily on the values of the Secret Constitution and the other, characteristic of German thought, relies heavily on the Kantian concept of human dignity. The general principle of equal treatment, as we have elaborated it, lends itself to the argument for limiting freedom of speech. The claim is that obscenity degrades women and, thus, fails to treat them equally with the men who are interested in consuming the obscene material. Similarly, hate speech systematically degrades its targets and, therefore, treats them as unworthy of equal status in society. These are good arguments that draw on a long tradition of concern in the theory of equality for protecting the weak and defenseless.<n>The alternative mode of compassionate jurisprudence relies on the concept of human dignity, elaborated in Article 1 of the German Basic Law of 1949. The term “human dignity” is not defined in the Basic Law and, therefore, the courts must rely on the basic Kantian principles that human dignity expresses the ultimate personhood of each individual. In my view, although we have never expressed a principle of human dignity in American constitutional law, the same principle underlies our commitment to the Great Maxim. Our notion of equality-in-creation derives from the view that we are all of ultimate value, an idea that can be expressed either by going back to the biblical idea of creation in the image of God or taking the secular alternative of human dignity beyond all price, as articulated in Kant’s moral theory.24<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
The first additional system consists in pyrophosphate, PP, a high-energy dimer of monophosphate that breaks down to form two monophosphates, P + P. Like any reaction, the reaction converting PP to P + P has an equilibrium, hence an equilibrium ratio of PP and P. In the presence of excess PP compared to equilibrium, the reaction flows toward equilibrium by the spontaneous cleavage of PP to yield P + P.<n>My purpose in invoking the exergonic conversion of PP to P + P is to utilize the loss of free energy in this exergonic reaction to drive the DNA trimer-hexamer reaction beyond its own equilibrium, leading thereby to an excess synthesis of the 3’CCCGGG5’ hexamer when compared to its equilibrium concentration. Thus, the excess synthesis of the hexamer, which would not occur spontaneously, is driven endergonically by being coupled to the exergonic breakdown of PP to P + P (Figure 3.4). In short, the exergonic breakdown of PP to P + P supplies the free energy to drive the excess buildup of 3’CCCGGG5’ concentration beyond its own equilibrium with respect to its trimer substrates, 5’GGG3’ and 5’CCC3’.<n>The excess synthesis of 3’CCCGGG5’ constitutes excess reproduction of the hexamer autocatalytic reaction product beyond that which would occur without the coupling to the additional PP free energy source. Thus, the system is reproducing “better” with the coupling to PP than without the coupling.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
The excess synthesis of 3’CCCGGG5’ constitutes excess reproduction of the hexamer autocatalytic reaction product beyond that which would occur without the coupling to the additional PP free energy source. Thus, the system is reproducing “better” with the coupling to PP than without the coupling.<n>Another point to note is that the coupling of the breakdown of PP to P + P with the excess synthesis of the DNA hexamer compared to the equilibrium concentration of the DNA hexamer means that energy is stored within the system. This is true because the excess concentration of the hexamer DNA, compared to its equilibrium, could in principle be released by degradation of the hexamer to the two trimer substrates, releasing that stored free energy as this reaction couple flowed toward its own equilibrium ratio of hexamer and trimers. Thus, the coupling to the PP to P + P reaction means that the autonomous agent stores energy internally. Later in evolution, such internally stored energy can be used to drive reactions that correct errors, as in DNA repair in contemporary cells. I am glad to thank Phil Anderson and, indirectly, John Hopfield for this point.<n>Once the pyrophosphate, PP, is cleaved to form P + P, as this reaction flows toward its own equilibrium ratio of PP to P, that free energy is used up. In order to have a renewed internal supply of the free energy needed to synthesize excess hexamer, it is convenient to resynthesize pyrophosphate from the two monophosphates, P + P. I’ll return below to the meaning of “convenient,” for in a general sense, the convenience reflects the organization of processes that sustains an agent, and that organization is not convenient, it is essential.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt

This is true because we used the exergonic breakdown of PP to P + P to drive the excess synthesis of 3’CCCGGG5’. Now we need to add energy to resynthesize PP from P + P. To do so, I invoke an additional source of free energy in the form of an electron, e, which absorbs a photon, hv; is driven endergonically to an excited state, e*, and falls back exergonically to its low-energy state, e, in a reaction that is coupled to the synthesis of PP from P + P.<n>The point of this third reaction-couple is clear: PP is resynthesized from P + P so that PP can continue to drive the excess synthesis of the DNA hexamer, 3’CCCGGG5’. Overall, the total system of linked reactions is exergonic = there is an overall loss of free energy that is ultimately supplied by the incoming photon, hv, plus the 2 substrates, 5’GGG3’, and 5’CCC3’.

Your role in organizing the processes would be taken by gears, escapements, rods, connectors, bearings, and other bits of machinery.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Thus, our molecular autonomous agent constitutes a system with two essential features of living systems, self-reproduction and metabolism. However, my insistence that an autonomous agent carries out a work cycle refines the generally understood concept of a metabolism to include the requirement that the metabolism carries out a work cycle.<n>The second feature to note is that our autonomous agent is, necessarily, a nonequilibrium system. Free energy, here in the form of the photon, hv, and the trimer substrates is taken in and used to drive the linked synthesis of PP and excess DNA hexamer. There is no agency at equilibrium. The excess synthesis of DNA hexamer constitutes excess replication of the hexamer by virtue of the coupling of the trimer-hexamer synthesis to the PP  P + P cycle of reactions, which, as noted next, constitute a “chemical engine.”<n>The third feature to note is the work cycle performed by the agent. The simplest way of seeing the work cycle here is in the behavior of the PP  P + P reaction. In the Carnot cycle, the working gas cycles from compressed and hot to less compressed and cool, back to compressed and hot. In our hypothetical autonomous agent, there is a macroscopic cycle of matter from PP to P + P via the reaction- forming DNA hexamer and back around to PP via the reaction with the high-energy electron. The macroscopic cycling of matter around this cycle is the engine at work. (I am grateful to Peter Wills for this clarification of the concept of a chemical motor.) In addition, depending upon the details of the kinetic constants, our autonomous agent may literally show an oscillatory concentration cycle in which PP concentration begins high and falls as P + P is formed, then the high PP concentration is reformed by use of the photon-energized exergonic e*  e reaction.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt

At the end of the cycle the system is poised to cycle again. A repeating organization of process is achieved. And next, just as the Carnot engine run backward is a refrigerator and not a pump, if the reactions of the autonomous agent were run backward the PP  P + P engine would run in the reverse direction. This is because all reaction couples would be displaced from equilibrium the opposite way and the analogue of throwing the gears in reverse, namely reversing in sign the positive and negative activator and inhibitor couplings to the two proper enzymes, would convert the excess energy stored in the above equilibrium concentration of hexamer into production of the two trimers and the resynthesis of PP from P + P. Were the release of the photon, hv, a readily reversible step, the excess of PP would drive emission of a photon by the excited electron, thus returning the electron to the initial unexcited state.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt

Maxwell asks us to consider the very same box with N particles in it. But he imagines the box to be divided into two chambers by a wall with a window in it. In the window is a flap valve. When the flap valve is open, gas particles can pass from the left to the right box via the window, or from the right to the left box via the window.<n>Now, smiles Maxwell, suppose the initial state of the gas in the box is in the equilibrium macrostate. No macroscopic work can be done by the equilibrium system. That was Carnot’s central point. There is plenty of energy in the random motions of the gas particles, but there is no means to extract mechanical work from it, say, to drive a piston. Next, says Maxwell, warming to his point, “Imagine that my wee friend operates the flap valve such that, whenever a fast gas particle approaches the window from inside the left box toward the right box, he opens the flap and lets the faster than average, hence hotter, gas particle through. And suppose my demon also operates the flap value to let the slower than average, hence cooler, gas particles pass from the right to the left box. Well, soon the left box will be cool and the right box will be hot. And now,” concludes Maxwell with a broad smile, “we can use the macroscopic temperature dierence between the left and right boxes to extract mechanical work, say, by driving a piston.”<n>There you have it. Maxwell posed a severe question for statistical mechanics and the second law. It appeared that the actions of the demon might circumvent the second law.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
The linked exergonic and endergonic organic chemistry reactions present in the molecular autonomous agents that we call cells exemplify just this structural and functional subtlety. The electric charge distribution on two complex organic molecules brought into proximity, coupled with the modes of translational, vibrational, and rotational motions, constitute the subtle means to measure displacements from equilibrium, couple to those displacements, and achieve linked catalyzed exergonic and endergonic reactions. As the molecular diversity of the biosphere increases, more such molecular species displaced from equilibrium come into existence, more such molecular species able to detect such displacements from equilibrium come into existence, more such coupled catalyzed exergonic and endergonic reactions come into existence.<n>In general, it would begin to appear that as a higher diversity of entities come into existence  entities that are then necessarily more complex  their modes of being in nonequilibrium conditions increase in diversity and subtlety. In turn, the very existence of sets of these increasingly diverse and complex entities gives them an increased number of ways, and so an increased probability, to couple with one another such that one may measure a displacement from equilibrium of the other; hence, these entities happen upon a source of energy that can be and is extracted to do work. In turn, that work may drive nonspontaneous processes to create still more complex molecular species or other entities in the adjacent possible.<n>In short, there appears to be some positive relationship between the diversity and complexity of structures or processes and the diversity and complexity of the features of a nonequilibrium system, which can be detected and measured by the detecting structure to identify a source of energy, then couple to the source of energy and actually extract work. If there is a relation such that diverse and complex features of nonequilibrium systems useful as sources of energy can best be detected by equally diverse and complex structures, then there appears to be some generalized “autocatalytic” set of processes in the universe since the big bang, and in a biosphere, by which nonequilibrium systems of increasing complexity and diversity arise, provide sources of energy of increasing subtlety and complexity, and in turn are detected and extracted by the increasingly complex structures that arise.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
So we appear to come to an interesting circle. It sometimes takes work to construct constraints, and it takes constraints to get work.<n>Does it always take work to construct constraints? No, as we will soon see. Does it often take work to construct constraints? Yes. In those cases, the work done to construct constraints is, in fact, another coupling of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes. But this is just what we are suggesting must occur in autonomous agents. In the universe as a whole, exploding from the big bang into this vast diversity, are many of the constraints on the release of energy that have formed due to a linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes? Yes. What might this be about? I’ll say it again. The universe is full of sources of energy. Nonequilibrium processes and structures of increasing diversity and complexity arise that constitute sources of energy and that measure, detect, and capture those sources of energy, build new structures that constitute constraints on the release of energy, and hence drive nonspontaneous processes to create more such diversifying and novel processes, structures, and energy sources.<n>I find it delightful that we hardly have the concepts to state these issues; surely we have as yet no coherent theory for this burgeoning of process and structure. Whatever it is, a biosphere does it. It was quite barren in Nebraska, wherever Nebraska was, four billion years ago. Not now.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
On the other hand, there may be a parallel between the exaptations of which we have spoken and Godel’s theorem and the augmentation of the axiom set such that formerly unprovable statements become provable. That is, the emergence of novel exaptations in evolution do seem rather like the emergence of novel primitive objects and primitive control operations = hence, novel axioms. In the examples above, the emergence of the genetic code and the emergence of chromosomes that duplicate and partition daughter chromosomes into two daughter cells, the evolution of controlled recombination, seem to become instantiated as “biological laws,” even though they are entirely historically contingent. Changing the biological laws in evolution seems rather like the generation of a novel axiom from which new consequences can be derived.<n>On this interpretation, my claim that we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere becomes the claim that the biosphere keeps generating new “causal axioms” from which it generates novel forms. Then just as we do not know where the new axioms of a formal system come from, save as the free invention of the logician involved, so it would seem that we cannot prestate the new generative exaptations that allow evolution to drive in new directions. I am not entirely persuaded by this analogy to finding ever new axioms in Godel’s theorem, but it does have some coherence.<n>Indeed, the failure to be able to prestate the configuration space of the biosphere may be yet deeper. I will take a stab at a proof. I begin by vitiating my assumption that one cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere, then try to show that the implications are that the number of potentially relevant properties is vastly hyperastronomical and that there is no way in the lifetime of the universe for any knower within the universe to enumerate, let alone work with, all the possible properties or categories and their causal consequences.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
Consider an ecosystem with dierent species of bacteria. Each species may secrete dierent chemical species, S, that impinge on a subset, C, of the other cell species. In Figure . I show a three-dimensional coordinate system. One axis shows the order-chaos axis for a single isolated bacterium, measured by Derrida curve criteria, with order on the left, near the origin, and chaos on the right. The remaining axes show C and S.<n>If a given cell is at the phase transition between order and chaos, and additional molecular inputs, S per cell, come from C dierent types of cells, the total connectivity in the cell is raised from KN to KN + CS. The results will typically drive that cell into the chaotic regime. Indeed, the entire community will be driven into the chaotic regime.<n>Hence, in the coordinate system of Figure ., Igor Yakushin at Bios Group has shown that a hyperbolic surface, as shown, separates the ordered regime from the chaotic regime. Cells can buer themselves from chemical perturbations from other species by retreating deeper into the ordered regime. This can be accomplished by increasing the number of canalyzing inputs per gene. And indeed, as described above, individual eukaryotic cells do appear to lie well within the ordered regime, perhaps as buering for the fact that such cells, like yeast, live in microbial communities or, like human cells, live in tissues where each cell is bombarded with chemical signals from other cells in the same body.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt

One is to take a large, flat table, supply lots of sand, and gently let sand fall from on high onto the table. As the sand piles up, it eventually reaches the rest angle for sand and also extends to the boundaries of the table. You keep adding sand slowly. Sand-slide avalanches begin to form and sand drops to the floor. Measure the size distribution of the avalanches and a power law distribution is revealed, with many small avalanches and few large avalanches (Figure .).<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
Recall the Noah’s Vessel experiment, with two of every species ground up in a blender, breaking all cell membranes, comingling the trillion or so proteins of the hundred million species with the thousands of small molecule metabolites. A supracritical explosion of chemical diversity would presumably ensue. As I noted, life has learned to avoid that fate. Cells are subcritical. Were they not, then any new chemical that chanced to enter the cells of Fredricka the fern would unleash a cascade of synthesis of novel molecular species, some of which would presumably kill poor Fredricka. Best defense? Stay subcritical. Why mess with that mess?<n>But recall that a mixed microbial community should be able to be driven to the subcritical-supracritical boundary by increasing the diversity of microbial species present and/or hitting the community with a sucient diversity of novel small molecule species. My argument follows that if the community is supracritical, the novel cascading molecular species will kill o some of the microbial species, thereby lowering the community toward the subcritical regime. On the other hand, mutation and immigration should drive the community toward the supracritical regime. Do mixed microbial communities hover on the subcritical-supracritical boundary? We have seen other reasons that bound a community’s complexity, including Ksat problems noted in this chapter. So a better question is: Can microbial communities be driven supracritical? And if so, are they often near that boundary?<n>Of course, I do not know, but the hypothesis is testable. Increase the diversity of species and test for the diversity of synthesized small molecules, say, by gas chromatography. A colleague and I once devised such an experiment with mixtures of increasingly diverse moss species, planning to measure the molecular diversity of gas species evolved as a function of community diversity and the diversity in gas species introduced to the community. We went skiing instead. I still like the lines of the experiment. It could be carried out directly with mixed microbial communities as well.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
Vince and I want to say that natural rationality is bounded to models of intermediate complexity because we collectively and persistently create nonstationary worlds together. In the agent-based computer models Vince has created for his thesis, just this behavior is seen. Indeed, we allow agents to evolve how much of the past history of the interactions they will pay attention to and how complex their models of one another will be  one, four, or fifty Fourier modes. Agents evolve in a history and complexity space to find currently optimal amounts of history and complexity to use to optimally predict their neighbors. In our little world, the agents evolve to use a modest history, ignoring the distant past, and only modestly complex theories of one another.<n>We have found evidence of a further, perhaps generic, property that appears to drive such systems to settle down, then change in a sudden burst. As the system of agents and actions settles down to some repeatable behavior, an increasingly wide range of alternative theories, simple and very complex, fit the same data. But the complex theories, with many Fourier modes, attempt to predict fine details of the repeatable behavior. As those theories become more complex, they are more fragile because they can be disconfirmed by ever more minor fluctuations in the repeatable behavior. Sooner or later such a fluctuation happens, and the agents with the complex disconfirmed theories change theories and actions radically, setting up a vast avalanche of changes of theories and actions that sweeps the system, driving the collective behavior far from any repeatable pattern. In these new circumstances, only a small subset of theories fits the current facts, so the diversity, and complexity, of theories in the population of agents plummets, and the system finds its way back to some repeatable pattern of behavior.<n>In short, there appears to be not only a bounded complexity in our rationality, but a fragility - stability cyclic oscillation in our joint theories and actions as well. In these terms, the system of agents and theories never settles down to a fixed-point equilibrium in which markets clear. Instead, the system repeatedly fluctuates away from the contract curve then returns to new points in the vicinity of the contract curve. Hence, in precisely the sense of repeatedly fluctuating away from a contract curve then returning to its vicinity, the system does not achieve an optimizing price equilibrium, but satisfices.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
If this view is correct, then diversity of goods and services is a major driver of economic growth. Indeed, I believe that the role of diversity of goods and services is the major unrecognized factor driving economic growth. Jane Jacobs had made the same point in her thoughtful books about the relation between economic growth and economic diversity of cities and their hinterlands. Economist Jose Scheinkman, now chairman of economics at the University of Chicago, and his colleagues studied a number of cities, normalized for total capitalization, and found that economic growth correlated with economic diversity in the city. In a similar spirit, microfinancing of a linked diversity of cottage businesses in the third world and the first world seems to be achieving local economic growth where more massive eorts at education and infrastructure, Aswan dams and power grids, seem to fail.<n>Indeed, in the same way in an ecosystem, organisms create niches for other organisms. I suspect, therefore, that over the past . billion years, the growth of diversity of species is autocatalytic, for the number of possible niches increases more rapidly than the number of species filling niches. And in the linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes, the universe as a whole advances autocatalytically into its adjacent possible, driven by the very increase of diversity by which novel displacements from equilibrium come into existence, are detected, are coupled to, and come to drive the endergonic creation of novel kinds of molecules and other entities. Economic growth is part and parcel of the creativity of the universe as a whole.<n>Think of the Wright brothers’ airplane. It was a recombination between an airfoil, a light gasoline engine, bicycle wheels, and a propeller. The more objects an economy has, the more novel objects can be constructed. When we were working with rough stone in the Lower Paleolithic, we pretty much mastered everything that could be done until pressure flaking came along. Most forms of simple stone tools that could be made were made. Today, the adjacent possible of goods and services is so vast that the economy, stumbling and lunging into the future adjacent possible, will only construct an ever smaller subset of the technologically possible.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
But there is more, for the economic web states its own adjacent possible. Given the Queen Mary and an umbrella, the umbrella placed in the smoke stack of the Queen Mary is in the adjacent possible. Not much use. But what about a small umbrella on the back of a Cessna that opens upon landing: Ah, an air brake is a possible new good in the adjacent possible a few steps from here.<n>And still more. What are the statistics of the transformation of an economic web over time as new goods and services arise in the niches aorded by existing goods and services, and drive old goods and services extinct? No one makes Roman siege engines these days. Cruise missiles do the job better.<n>I believe such object-based economic web tools will come into existence in the near future. Indeed, Bios Group is involved in inventing and making them. And I believe that such tools will be very powerful means of coordinating activities within supply chains and within the larger economy when linked by automated markets.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt

At the southern tip, just before it turns west to Sagres, are the coast’s most spectacular sights. Ponta da Piedade (Point of Piety) is the mother of all stack and cliff formations along the Algarve, a stunning terracotta family of bridges, terraces, and grottoes. There is no beach here, but there are great views from above, and in season (spring to autumn) boat trips depart from the foot of the long stairways that have been cut deep into the sides of the cliff.<n>For a complete change of scenery, take a drive northwest towards the hills and Bensafrim. Here you can enjoy the Algarve of yesteryear and rolling undeveloped countryside, where people still live off the land. The tilled soil, a startling ochre color, makes a colorful backdrop for orange and lemon groves. Turn off towards the Barragem da Bravura, a dam, and you’ll be rewarded with a sight every bit as inspiring as its name. This water, more akin to the English Lake District than sunny southern Europe, is also of great practical use, irrigating crops, including rice, around Lagos. A new road connects with the old EN 125 route and will undoubtedly open up this relatively undeveloped area.<n>portimão and environs<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
Few people seem to do it, but it is well worth spending a night or two in Faro, especially if you’ve already spent some time in a traditional Algarvian beach resort. Watch the sun setting over the fishing boats in the lagoon while you have a drink in the splendidly old-fashioned, cavernous Café Aliança, the city’s oldest café. Faro also has some lively music bars.<n>Faro’s beach, the Praia de Faro, is noted for its watersports. You can drive there across the single-lane causeway linking the long, strip of dunes with the mainland (no buses or motor homes allowed), or in the summer catch a ferry from the pier by the old town. If the ocean is rough, simply cross to the opposite side of the sand spit and swim in the calm, warmer waters of the lagoon (though be aware, it can sometimes be muddy and a little unpleasant).<n>The Sotavento Coast<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
The town square, Praça do Marquês do Pombal, is the work of the royal architect, and the tour de force of Vila Real. The pavement’s black and white wedges of stone radiate from an obelisk in the center of the square like rays from the sun. Distinguished three-story, late 18th-century houses line the square, and orange trees soften the edges, adding color and scent. Visit the small Manuel Cabanas Museum, just off the square, to see a nice collection of woodcuts that ranges from rustic scenes to famous statesmen and composers.<n>Today Vila Real is sleepy but quietly dignified. A walk around the old quarter reveals a number of fine, brightly painted houses along pedestrian-only streets. Vila Real de Santo António’s main appeal is as the ferry port to Ayamonte across the water in Spain. The trip takes just 20 minutes — less time than it would take to drive to and over the new bridge — and the white town of Ayamonte is a fine sight as you approach it from the river. Crossing into Spain, you will need to take your passport.<n>Excursion to Lisbon<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
Without doubt, the initial lure of the city is its numerous historic buildings. The lines of tall, narrow houses with their pretty gables rest beside picture-perfect tree-lined canals. They are connected by ornate iron bridges and cobbled walkways, which have changed little for over 300 years, in fact, since they felt the footfall of such inhabitants as the artist Rembrandt and explorer Abel Tasman, who gave his name to Tasmania.<n>Amsterdam is a wonderful city for visitors. Small enough to stroll around, and with the canal side streets too narrow for tour buses, you can’t drive past all the best attractions at high speed. Here, there is no glass window between you and reality. You have to feel the summer sun, or see your breath on a crisp winter morning as you step out to see what Amsterdam is all about. If you take a canal tour, the quiet boats allow you to float slowly along, away from the noise of the modern world.<n>The museums could keep you busy for weeks. Art collections, historic houses, and memorials to heroes and heroines can all be found here. For entertainment after the sun sets, there are over 40 different performances in the city every evening. The Netherlands National Opera and National Ballet are based here, and there are numerous orchestral, musical, and comedy venues, along with revues and dance shows. Amsterdam also plays host to one of the most dynamic club scenes in Europe, with several major venues drawing thousands of young people to the city.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-Intro.txt
Golf: There is an 18-hole golf course at Glyfáda, Tel. 01-9846820.<n>Snow Skiing: The nearest facilities can be found at Mount Parnassus (from December–March), a two-hour drive from the city. The hotels of Delphi and Arachova lie only twenty minutes from the slopes if you want a village atmosphere. Contact the Greek Alpine Club at Arachova, Tel. 01-2324555 for more details.<n>As in any major city, Athens has sporting facilities in the form of private clubs and community centers. The Olympic Athletic Center of Athens at Odos Kifisias 37, Marousi (Tel. 01-6834060) has a range of excellent facilities including nine swimming pools, basketball courts, and a velodrome — all for use during the 2004 Olympic Games.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhatToDo.txt
The Southern Resorts<n>Most of Bali’s tourism is concentrated in a tiny fraction of the island, with the vast majority of visitors heading for the “big three” beaches, namely Sanur, Kuta, and Nusa Dua, all within a short drive of the airport. Some stretches of sand are so magnificent and the water so warm, it’s hard to believe that they were ignored for so long by the Balinese people, who have traditionally turned away from the sea. Now visitors come in the millions from all over the world with little in mind but sun, sand, warm seas, and watersports.<n>Sanur<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
A company called Un Cotxe Menys (the name means “one fewer car” in Catalan) offers easygoing, enjoyable Barcelona-by-bike tours around La Ribera, the Gothic Quarter, and the waterfront (one includes dinner). Evening outings include drinks and even dinner (Tel. 93/268 21 05 or 93/207 08 96 for more information). On Tibidabo, the Carretera de las Aiguas, a dirt path that winds along the mountain for several miles, with spectacular views of the city below, is a great place to walk, jog, or bicycle.<n>At the Reial Club de Golf El Prat near the airport, 27 holes provide three different circuits. Clubs and carts may be rented, and there’s a pool for spouses and children. Other nearby courses are at Sant Cugat, off the A-7 motorway just west of the city beyond Tibidabo, and the Terramar course near Sitges, about an hour’s drive away. For sailing information, you can contact the Reial Club Marítim (Tel. 93/315 00 07).<n>Skiing is one of the most popular sports in Catalonia. Each year brings new developments in the Pyrenees, most within two hours of Barcelona: Núria, at 1,963 meters (6,439 feet); La Molina, whose slopes rise to 2,537 meters (8,321 feet); and Vallter, with 12 slopes and a top station at 2,500 meters (8,200 feet). Information on the conditions of roads and slopes can be obtained from the Associació Catalana d’Estacions d’Esquí (Tel. 93/416 09 09).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt
It’s easy to get to the Costa Daurada beaches from Barcelona. The coast south of the city earned its name from its broad, golden sands, in contrast to the rocky coves of the Costa Brava to the north. Sitges, a favorite resort of Barcelonans, is the best site for a day trip. It’s a 43-km (27-mile) and 45-minute drive, less than half an hour by train from the city’s Estació-Sants.<n>The coastal drive is a very scenic but narrow and curvy route. If you prefer, you can by-pass this road by taking the toll road, which gets you to Sitges in under 10 minutes. Happily, the pretty town has escaped the high-rises and tawdry atmosphere of many coastal resorts, although it does get somewhat overwhelmed by crowds in summer. There are two beaches, separated by a promontory where gleaming whitewashed houses cluster around the church of Sant Bartomeu. La Ribera is almost 3 kilometers (2 mile) long, backed by a promenade lined with cafés and restaurants.<n>Besides the beaches, Sitges is known for its collection of small, appealing museums. The Museu Cau Ferrat is installed in the house of the painter Santiago Rusiñol (1861–1931), whose collection of works by El Greco, Casas, Picasso, and others is on display, along with many of his own works. Across the street, the Museu Maricel del Mar holds a small collection of medieval sculpture and paintings in a splendid house overlooking the sea.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
Mid Ocean Golf Course and Castle Harbour Golf Course straddle the roads here, their verdant greens and fairways tumbling across the undulating land, separated by small casuarina copses. (Be mindful of the state of play as you pass across the fairways here: there is a danger from flying or wayward balls!) The Mid Ocean Club is still a private members’ club with a long pedigree. It has played host to many important political summits since the end of World War II, including the “Big Three” Conference in 1953 attended by Winston Churchill, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Joseph Laniel, the French prime minister.<n>South Road comes to an abrupt end at Tucker’s Town Bay, a small jetty and inlet with yachts bobbing gently in the water. To get across Castle Harbour to St. George’s, you must go north here, taking Paynter’s Road to Harrington Sound. Then drive up along Harrington Sound Road to reach the Causeway to St. George’s.<n>On your way up Harrington Sound Road, you will come to Lemington Caves, a series of caves smaller than Crystal Caves but equally spectacular. Watch also for Walsingham Lane and a sign to Tom Moore’s Tavern, named after the Irish poet who spent some time on Bermuda. The tavern (which is in fact a restaurant with French and local cuisine) is open only in the evening. In the daytime you can visit Idwal Hughes Nature Reserve, also along Walsingham Lane — a pristine area of natural habitat. Collapsed limestone caves and tidal seawater mangrove swamps provide a perfect home for herons, tropical frogs, and many species of fish.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
Billiards and bowling. “Billiards,” which also includes ten-pin bowling, snooker, and pool, is a very popular pastime in Budapest. For a list of venues ask Tourinform or see the Sports and Leisure section in the Budapest Sun.<n>Golf. This is a newcomer to Hungary, and you will have to drive some way out of town if you want to play. The Budapest Golf Course is a 9-hole, par 36 course with driving range, 35 km (22 miles) north at Kisoroszi (tel. 1170-6025). Bookings are required. The nearest 18-hole course is 200 km (120 miles) away to the west in Bükk.<n>Horseback riding. There are numerous good stables and horse-riding schools just outside Budapest, and riding holidays around the Balaton area and farther aﬁeld are on offer at Budapesti Equestrian Club (tel. 313-5210) and Petoreházy Club Hotel (tel. 176-5937). Ask Tourinform for details, pay a visit to the aptly-named Pegazus Tours on Fereciek tere, or see the IBUSZ brochure, Riding in Hungary.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhatToDo.txt
Horseback riding. Yosemite and Sequoia are both great places for horseback riding, with rental stables near the main hotels and lodges.<n>Skiing. In the winter, first-class cross-country skiing is available in Yosemite Valley and its surrounding wild country. There are also downhill skiing areas at Badger Pass near Yosemite and in Squaw Valley near Lake Tahoe. Other popular ski resorts are the Mammoth Lakes in the Eastern Sierra and Big Bear Lake, a few hours drive from L.A.<n>For a full list of skiing resorts, ask at a Visitor Information Center (see page 123) for the Winter Sports Guide.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhatToDo.txt
Tiburon is the quieter of the two, while Sausalito is more of a tourist trap, but both have a colorful Mediterranean atmosphere, with art galleries, yacht harbors, craft shops, and pleasant bistros and cafés out on the boardwalk overlooking the bay.<n>Farther inland is the woodsy residential paradise of Mill Valley, and behind it rises the 2,604-ft (794-m) summit of Mount Tamalpais. The mountain bike was invented here in the 1970s, and there are plenty of hiking and biking trails, but if you’re feeling lazy you can drive along the Panoramic Highway to within a few hundred yards of the summit. The view from the top is memorable — across the bay to the city and then beyond to Mount Diablo, and on a clear day you might even catch a glimpse of the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains.<n>Highway 1 twists through the hills to the coast, past the Muir Woods National Monument, named after John Muir, the Scots-born environmentalist, who founded California’s conservation movement at the turn of the 19th century. The park protects several groves of magnificent coastal redwoods, some of which are 250 ft (76 m) tall and over 1,000 years old. Hiking trails wind among the giant trees.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
Berkeley<n>Take the BART subway from Market Street or drive across the Bay Bridge to make a pilgrimage to the University of California campus at Berkeley (pronounced BIRK-lee), the scene of 1960s student radicalism. Opened in 1873, Berkeley is the oldest of the University of California’s nine campuses. Tours of the museums, library, gardens, and other sights are organized from the Student Union at the end of Telegraph Avenue (Monday–Saturday at 10am). The free and easy access to the university’s facilities will give you an insight into Berkeley’s open personality. The nearby streets are lined with lively cafés and interesting bookshops. If you’re driving, head over to Fourth Street for good food and prodigious shopping and people-watching.<n>Wine Country<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
The scenic valleys of Napa and Sonoma have been producing wine on a commercial basis since the middle of the 19th century, and today California wines are considered to be among the finest in the world. There are more than 250 vineyards — or wineries as they are called — and most of them offer guided tours and tastings. Some of the more interesting wineries to visit are Mondavi, Beringer, Sterling, and Beaulieu in Napa, and Matanzas Creek and Benzinger in Sonoma.<n>You can drive to the vineyards from San Francisco via Interstate 80, across the Bay Bridge, but bus tours are also available through the major providers. You can also arrange a custom tour, visiting wineries of your choice, through Wine Country Jeep Tours (Tel. 800/539-5337, toll-free in US). The Napa Valley Wine Train is another option for a scenic hands-off chug through the valley, including lunch or dinner, but no winery visits.<n>A note of warning: The entire region, and particularly the Napa Valley, is inundated with visitors all year round, especially on weekends. You would be well advised to book lodging, dining, and even tours ahead of time.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
One old cannery building has been splendidly converted to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, one of the premier aquariums in the world as well as an educational showcase for the unique underwater environment of Monterey Bay. The centerpiece is the stunning 30-ft- (10-m-) deep Kelp Forest Tank, a window on California’s most important marine habitat. Kids will love the Sea Otter Pool and the Touch Pools, where they can both handle and learn about sea anemones, crabs, and even bat rays.<n>The 17-Mile Drive is a lovely scenic toll road starting at Lighthouse Avenue in Pacific Grove, a pleasant waterside town of Victorian houses and clapboard cottages a few miles beyond Monterey. The drive passes through beautiful cypress groves along a wild and rocky coastline, where you can watch birds, otters, and sea lions in the wild, before passing through the famous golf courses at Pebble Beach and finally reaching the exclusive resort town of Carmel-by-the-Sea, famous for once having Clint Eastwood as mayor. It is a quaint, picture-postcard village full of kitschy cottages, with narrow, tree-lined streets crammed with expensive restaurants, art galleries, and craft shops. At the foot of Ocean Avenue lies the beautiful white sand of Carmel Beach, backed by shady pines and cypress trees. Southeast of the town is the peaceful Carmel Mission, where Father Junípero Serra himself lies buried.<n>At Point Lobos State Reserve you can hike right down to the ocean’s edge. Watch especially for the playful sea otters, which can often be seen floating on their backs munching on a juicy abalone or two. From December to March, look out also for pods of migrating gray whales.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
Next door to the tar pits is the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), whose provocative modern architecture houses one of the state’s best art collections, including outstanding examples of Nepalese, Indian, and Tibetan art, Japanese scroll paintings, pre-Columbian art, and German Expressionist drawings. Other highlights include important works by Rembrandt, Dürer, Frans Hals, Picasso, and the Impressionists.<n>Motoring aficionados should drive another two blocks to the Petersen Automotive Museum (6060 Wilshire Boulevard), which houses the largest collection of cars, motorcycles, and related memorabilia in the country.<n>Hollywood<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
A couple of freeway exits away is the Hollywood Bowl, a splendid open-air amphitheater where the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra holds concerts under the gigantic illuminated letters of the Hollywood sign planted up in the hills.<n>South of Hollywood Boulevard is L.A.’s most famous street, Sunset Boulevard. The section between Hollywood and Beverly Hills, known simply as “The Strip,” continues to be the playground of the rich, famous, young, and hip. A drive down Sunset can be dangerous, as the billboards touting the latest movies and records may make it difficult to keep your eyes on the road.<n>While you’re on the north side of town, take a drive around the Hollywood Hills for a superb view of the city. The classic Los Angeles cruise is along Mulholland Drive. On a clear day you can see Long Beach, 25-miles (40-km) away across the vast, sprawling metropolis.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt

Fans of James Dean will recognize the Observatory — it was the scene of the climax of Rebel Without a Cause. The panorama from the terrace on a clear day is fantastic, from the spiky skyscrapers of downtown to the distant Pacific. Griffith Park is the biggest city park in the United States. It sprawls across the eastern Hollywood Hills and is criss-crossed with drives and hiking trails. Toward sunset is the best time to go, just as the city lights are coming on.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
Westside<n>At Doheny Drive, the western edge of Hollywood merges with the slopes of Laurel Canyon and Beverly Hills, dotted with the sumptuous mansions of the movie moguls. While these homes are heavily guarded and hidden from view, you can sense the opulent atmosphere as you drive through the plush, carefully manicured avenues. The architecture is an astounding mixture of Spanish, Gothic, Bauhaus, and Renaissance, in every pastel shade under the sun. Don’t bother slowing down for the street vendors selling “official” maps showing the homes of the rich and famous — unless you get a kick out of security gates.<n>Rodeo Drive (pronounced Ro-DAY-oh) is the famous shopping street (if you saw the movie Pretty Woman, you’ve seen Rodeo Drive) and it’s just as upscale and sophisticated as advertised. If you’re visiting in the summer or around Christmas, take a half-hour guided tour on the sweet Beverly Hills Trolley for $1. Meet the trolley on the corner of Rodeo and Dayton Way — it’s the only bargain you’ll find in the neighborhood.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
If you’re feeling up to it, push on along the Mist Trail, past Emerald Pool, to Nevada Fall, and you’ll begin to lose the crowds. Here you’re on part of the John Muir Trail (see page 39), which heads past Merced Lake and on to the lovely Tuolumne Meadows up in the high country. The final destination of the John Muir Trail is Mount Whitney, more than 200 miles (322 km) away.<n>Less exhausting is a drive or shuttle-bus ride past Badger Pass (good skiing slopes in winter) to Glacier Point — 7,214 ft (2,200 m) above sea level. The view over the whole valley and the High Sierras beyond is breathtaking, as is the other way to get here — a steep hike up the Four-Mile Trail.<n>You can see Yosemite Creek drop down half a mile from the opposite wall in the spectacular Upper, Middle, and Lower Yosemite Falls, and you’ll get an outstanding view of the majestic Half Dome, a granite monolith sliced in two by the Ice Age glaciers. From here you may feel like leaving the bus and hiking back down to the valley, along the Panorama Trail via the Nevada and Vernal Falls, a trip of 8 miles (13 km), most of it downhill!<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
Don’t be put off by the name Death Valley. It is a legacy of the bitter hardships endured by Gold Rush hopefuls who set out to cross the desert from Arizona and Nevada. Some never made it. Today’s travelers, however, are well catered to, with motels and campsites at Furnace Creek and Stovepipe Wells. Begin at the Furnace Creek Visitor Center, where you can pick up maps and information on the road conditions, hiking trails, and general desert safety. Driving is the only way to get around, but remember that distances are great and gasoline stations few and far between. Make sure your car is in good mechanical condition and that the tank is full before you begin each day’s tour. Also, you would be well advised to carry spare water, just in case the radiator boils over.<n>Get up at dawn — you won’t regret it — and drive out to Zabriskie Point. As the sun rises behind you, the light hits Tucki Mountain and the tips of the Panamints to the west before plunging into the valley’s primeval salt lake far below. Continue to Dante’s View (altitude 5,745 ft/1,750 m), where you can look out westward to Wildrose, Bennett, and Telescope peaks. Down in the valley in front of you lies the salty puddle called Badwater — at 282 ft (86 m) below sea level, which is the lowest point in the western hemisphere.<n>The crazed and pinnacled surface of the salt-caked lake bed has earned it the nickname of Devil’s Golf Course. Take a walk out across that glaring expanse of baked salt — the atmosphere of desolation is almost exhilarating. If you look closer at the salt under your feet, you’ll discover that the expansion of the crystallizing mineral has heaved it into bizarre funnels, swirls, and other intricate patterns.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
Nowhere is the clash of traditional values and modern industry more acute than it is in the western Subarctic. Here, some 11,000 native peoples from 20 tribes in the Northwest Territories sharing the Athapaskan language have joined as the Dene Nation. Together with the Métis Association (descendants of intermarried French fur traders and Plains Indians), they are involved in a tussle with private oil and natural gas companies to protect land rights and traditional culture.<n>Proponents of an Arctic gas pipeline passing through Indian lands in the Mackenzie Valley to northern Alberta argued that the Dene need revenues from the pipeline to escape poverty, and that in any case they no longer have an autonomous culture. They drive cars, wear Western clothes, speak English, and play country-and-western music. But Dene leaders, fearful of the project’s environmental impact, insisted their bush-related culture of hunting and fishing could and should be protected (through more self-government) before the pipeline was laid. Ottawa compromised with a shorter pipeline, one just for oil.<n>In fact, quite apart from the more tangible facets of Indian life that the Dene Nation is trying to preserve — language, customs, hunting and fishing grounds —the traditional values are what remain vitally important. In the past, native peoples moved around the Subarctic in small bands, with leaders not institutionalized in a sacred or hereditary role, but chosen very pragmatically for specific hunting skills or on-the-spot organizing abilities. A tough environment demanded tough qualities of interdependence and industriousness, sorely tried by contact with Europeans. The fur trade put an end to their semi-nomadic existence as they settled around the trading posts and became fiercely competitive with one another. A collapse of fur prices after World War II, coinciding with a rise in prices for consumer goods, left them dependent on federal welfare.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt
Niagara Peninsula<n>The 90-minute drive from Toronto to Niagara Falls (130 km/81 miles south of Toronto) curves around the west end of Lake Ontario through the province’s industrial heartland — Mississauga, Hamilton, and St. Catharines, known as the Golden Horseshoe. If you want to see the Falls without getting entangled overnight in the mob scene of the tourists (12 million visitors annually), stay over in the quieter town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, a mere half-hour drive away.<n>Niagara Falls<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Niagara-on-the-Lake<n>A meandering 30-km (18-mile) riverside drive north along the lovely tree-lined Niagara Parkway takes you from the tumult of the tourist buses to the tranquillity of this old Loyalist bastion. The town, settled by refugees from the American Revolution in 1792 and briefly capital of Upper Canada, jealously preserves an image of a “British” way of life revisited by North American nostalgia. The main street, Queen Street, pays tribute to the Anglo-Saxon myth with its clock tower, white clapboard and red-brick houses, the grand Prince of Wales Hotel, tea shops serving buns and buttered scones, and the lovingly restored Niagara Apothecary (1866) displaying old-fashioned medicine jars in walnut cabinets under ornamental crystal gaslights.<n>On the quiet avenues off the main street, you can taste something of the genteel life in some delightful little boarding houses that supplement the usual hotels. They operate principally from May to October, when the town hosts the popular Shaw Festival. Works of George Bernard Shaw and other major playwrights are performed in the modern Festival Theatre (Wellington Street and Queen’s Parade Road), with its pleasant garden for a cocktail between acts. A couple of smaller theaters put on musical comedies and light revues.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Stratford<n>Situated in the heart of the peninsula, 130 km (78 miles) or 2 hours’ drive from Toronto, Stratford town is well worth a visit for its celebrated Stratford Festival spanning the whole tourist season, from May to November. Since Tyrone Guthrie opened the festival in a tent in 1953, Shakespeare and other English classics such as Sheridan and Marlowe have been given pride of place. Their home is now the apron-staged Festival Theatre, while the Avon Theatre and Third Stage put on alternative fare, offering jazz and chamber-music concerts as well as a chance to discover Canadian playwrights.<n>Every effort is made to sustain an Elizabethan atmosphere, with curtain times heralded by trumpeters in Renaissance doublet and hose. Picnic in Queen’s Park and give your crumbs to the ducks and swans on Victoria Lake. A Shakespearean Garden displays the flowers mentioned by the Bard in his sonnets and plays.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Sussex Drive<n>This is the grand parade drive along the Ottawa River to the town’s smartest residential neighborhood, home of ministers and “Embassy Row.”<n>The Neo-Gothic Basilica of Notre-Dame (Sussex at Guigues) was born with the capital. The Catholic cathedral’s steeples went up in 1858, though the whole church was not completed until 1890. Québec sculptors Louis Philippe Hébert, Philippe Parizeau, and Flavien Rochon carved the pulpit, choir stalls, organ loft, and bas-reliefs.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt

Here he still has the astrolabe that he lost on his explorations. and which gave its name to the nearby Astrolabe Amphitheatre, attractive setting for summer open-air concerts.<n>Where the road crosses over the Rideau River and Green Island, look for Rideau Falls, pouring its double “curtain” (French rideau) of water into the Ottawa River.

The windmill is part of a Renewable Energy Exhibit of methods of gathering solar and wind energy.<n>For Canadians, 24 Sussex Drive has the same significance as 10 Downing Street for the British. This grey stone house hidden behind the greenery is the Canadian Prime Minister’s residence. His neighborhood, in Rideau Hall just along the road (1 Sussex Drive), is the official residence of the monarchy, the governor general. Except on official occasions, the guards in appropriately British uniforms will usually let you drive or walk in to admire the sweeping stretch of lawns and gardens — look for the governor’s toboggan slide and skating rink.<n>The drive then circles around the immaculate gardens and fine mansions of Rockcliffe Park. The park’s driveway takes you out to the Rockcliffe Lookout for a spectacular view of the Ottawa River and the mouth of the Gatineau. In the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Barracks, at the north end of St. Laurent Boulevard, you can see some of the horses performing or training for the popular RCMP Musical Ride, the one occasion when the Mounties are still Mounties.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt

Gatineau Park<n>Just a 20-minute drive across the Ottawa River into Québec, and actually the most popular of excursions from the national capital, this 36,000-hectare (89,000-acre) park of lakes and woodland covers an escarpment with dramatic lookouts over the plains of the Ottawa Valley. It’s named after the French hunter Nicolas Gatineau, who first explored it, and its evergreen and deciduous forests are still the home of an abundant wildlife.<n>Go hiking or biking on well-planned nature trails (details can be obtained from the Old Chelsea Visitors Center). Besides swimming at five public beaches, you can rent canoes and rowboats for fishing on Philippe and La Pêche lakes. Visit Kingsmere, the charming estate where William Lyon Mackenzie King spent his last years. As well as exploring the occult — he spoke to his departed mother through a crystal ball — Canada’s longest-serving Prime Minister liked to collect “ruins” on his many world travels. Among others, you’ll find in his gardens pieces of London’s House of Commons, brought back after the Blitz of World War II.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The virgin forests were long a refuge for Algonquin Indians fleeing the Iroquois. The Québécois began to settle here in any great numbers only in the second half of the 19th century, when an enterprising curate, Antoine Labelle of St-Jérôme, promoted it as an alternative for peasants who were otherwise immigrating to New England. This southeastern edge of the great Canadian Shield proved poor farm country and difficult to exploit for logging, but it really came into its own in the 20th century with the development of tourism. In addition to local Montréalers, it attracts steady traffic from New England.<n>The heart of the resort area is within an easy 90-minute to 2-hour drive from the city for a weekend or longer stay. Motorway 15 northwest from Montréal, then Highway 117 take you into forested foothills immediately beyond the metropolis.<n>Just 70 km (42 miles) from the city, St-Sauveur-des-Monts makes a charming spot to stop for lunch on one of the roadside flowered terraces. In winter, the resort is popular for its floodlit nightskiing. Ste-Adèle on the shores of Lac Rond is a favorite with painters and their groupies. The town’s Village de Séraphin recaptures the atmosphere of life in the Laurentians in the 1880s.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Beyond the City Wall<n>From the Parc de l’Esplanade, drive up the Côte de la Citadelle hill road and through a tunnel for a guided tour around a powerful bastion of fears long gone. The French built the starshaped Citadel in 1750 to resist the British. The British enlarged it in 1820 to defend Québec City against the Americans, but their cannons never fired a shot in anger. The garrison was British-manned for only 20 years before being handed over to Canadian troops. Today it is the home of Canada’s crack Royal 22nd Regiment.<n>In summertime the garrison comes to life with the Changing of the Guard (10am daily, June 24–first week of Sept.) and Beating the Retreat (6pm Wed–Sat during July and August). The old powder house serves now as the Musée Militaire, displaying the regiment’s history with its trophies, weapons, and uniforms.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
You’d think the chamber of commerce carved their map as a public relations gimmick, but the province really is shaped like a lobster. In any case, many a gourmet or glutton feels that a Halifax lobster dinner is reason enough to make the trip. But weight watchers can enjoy Nova Scotia, too.<n>There’s the sparkling Atlantic coastline, with its delightful little fishing ports. Or rolling green hills across the interior to the orchards and dairy farms of Annapolis Valley. This western side of the peninsula is rich in the poignant history of French Acadia. The province’s northern island is the site of one of Canada’s best-loved national parks, Cape Breton Highlands, where you’ll drive the spectacular Cabot Trail along the coast and in and out of the forest.<n>Halifax<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Scores of lighthouses along Nova Scotia’s south shore trace a sawtoothed route of coves that over the ages offered shelter to pirates, rum-runners, and fishermen. For the modern holidaymaker, there are plenty of pleasant bathing beaches, too.<n>The 45-minute, 48-km (30-mile) drive along winding coastal Highway 333 from Halifax southwest to Peggy’s Cove has become a photographer’s pilgrimage. This almost unbearably picturesque fishing village perches its brightly colored clapboard cottages and lighthouse among massive granite boulders. The trick is to keep the snack-bars and souvenir shops out of the picture.<n>You’ll find more deserted coves and beaches around St. Margaret’s Bay as you drive on to Chester, 79 km (49 miles) west of Peggy’s Cove on Mahone Bay. This fashionable resort town was founded in 1759 by Massachusetts fishermen and remains a favorite vacation spot for New Englanders.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt

Oxcarts and horse-drawn haywagons take you around the property, where you can watch barrel-making, see the old farm implements in action, and buy produce from the farm kitchen and locally made craftware. Take a boat trip from the town of Mahone Bay to Oak Island. Dreamers still dig for the gold doubloons, emeralds, rubies, and diamonds that Captain William Kidd, lovable villain of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island, is said to have buried here. This real-life Scots-born 17th-century brigand received the official blessing of the British governor of New York to plunder French, Spanish, and Dutch ships from the Caribbean to Madagascar, frequently hiding out on the Nova Scotia coast.

That blessing didn’t keep him from being hanged in London, convicted of murder and acts of piracy.<n>Down the coast from Mahone Bay, Lunenburg, the original 18th-century settlement of German Protestants, is an attractive town of grey-weathered shingleboard houses. Its proud boast in modern times is the building of the original Bluenose racing schooner. On the waterfront, the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic will give you a vivid sense of the whole history of sailing and fishing along Nova Scotia’s coasts. Besides a beautiful model of the Bluenose, the museum’s star attractions are two old ships moored in the port: the schooner Theresa E. Connor used for cod fishing and the trawler Cape Sable. Across Lunenburg Harbor, take a clifftop hike through the little pine forest and around the striking rock formations of The Ovens. These deep caves were the scene of a mini gold rush in 1861, when New Englanders poured into the area to pan a few — very few — nuggets from the shale on the beach. A little museum shows you their tools, techniques, and a few molar-sized bits of gold.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The airport outside the steel town of Sydney is the most convenient gateway for both the Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Park to the east and the Cabot Trail to the west, leading to Cape Breton Highlands National Park.<n>You may like to drive the more roundabout coast road over to Louisbourg with a side trip to Glace Bay. As an intriguing exercise in modern industrial archaeology, its desolate log cabins and colliery installations have become a coal mining village museum. Take the fascinating trip along the shafts and galleries of the abandoned Ocean Deep Mine, which reaches 17 km (11 miles) under the sea. You can have a coal miner’s meal at the colliery canteen. The great French fortress town of Louisbourg is presented as a splendid national historic park, one of the most elaborate in Canada’s ambitious reconstruction program. You’ll need a full day to do it justice. After the guided tour, take time to discuss extra details of 18th-century French colonial life with the well-informed and entertaining costumed volunteers performing the roles of fishermen, merchants, soldiers, and craftspeople (Tel. (902) 733-2280, <www.fortresslouisbourg.com>).<n>Building of the original fortress began in 1719, six years after the Treaty of Utrecht had left the French only Cape Breton Island. The ice-free port provided a year-round strategic defense of approaches to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Québec, and a commercial base for cod fishing, trade with the Caribbean, and smuggling to and from New England. The reconstruction of one-fifth of the town recaptures life as it was in the summer of 1744, a year before the first great British siege, and 16 years before it was destroyed.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Cape Breton Highlands National Park is a joy for all nature-lovers. The Cabot Trail leads you around the periphery, but clearly marked hiking trails (maps at the Ingonish park entrance) take you into the interior. Among the 27 hiking trails the best are the Glasgow Lakes trail to John Deer Lake and the trail around Beulach Ban Falls and French Mountain. Camping facilities on the edge of the park are better equipped than those marked out inside the forest. These “New Scottish” highlands look uncannily like those in the old country. To ram the point home, there’s even a Scottish shepherd’s cottage, Lone Shieling, off the highway at Grande Anse River. The forest, a mixture of conifers and hardwoods, shelters white-tailed deer, black bear, moose, beaver, red fox, lynx, mink, and snowshoe hare. Bird-watchers can spot, among many species, red-tailed hawk and the occasional bald eagle. Fishermen should get their license at the park entrance to angle for trout or salmon (no motorboats allowed). On the northeast corner of the park, Neil Harbor is a pleasant little fishing port with sandy beaches.<n>To explore the northern tip of the island, leave the park at South Harbor and drive 16 km (10 miles) to the fishing village of Bay St. Lawrence. Following a common seaport custom, the white clapboard village church, with its nave shaped like an upturned ship, was designed and built by local shipwrights. Take a bracing hike along the grassy cliff top west of town, but beware of the winds. Southwest of the park, Chéticamp is an old stronghold of Acadian culture, with a museum exhibiting craftware as it was crocheted, spun, hooked, or woven in bygone centuries. At the museum’s little restaurant you can sample a traditional meal of clam chowder, meat pâté, and molasses cakes. Expert anglers insist that the salmon fishing near Margaree Forks is the best in eastern Canada. North East Margaree has a salmon museum devoted to the fish’s life cycle and the cunning tricks of poachers.<n>In a fairytale setting of wooded hills around Bras d’Or (Golden Arm) Lake, Baddeck, a popular tourist center, likes to be known as the place in which telephone-inventor Alexander Graham Bell chose to spend the last, very active years of his life. His home, hidden in the forest, is not open to the public, but the superbly organized museum in the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Park shows how the great man devoted his energies in Baddeck to aviation. Besides his invention of the tetrahedral kite, the exhibits illustrate his work on the telephone and inventions of medical and maritime instruments. The museum gives plenty of space to photos of his family life in Edinburgh, the United States, and Baddeck — which reminded him of countryside near Edinburgh. If this has whetted your taste for things Scottish, end your tour at the southern tip of St. Ann’s Bay, where Gaelic College gives summer courses in bagpipe-playing, dancing, and tartan-weaving. Even if you’re not tempted to sign up, you can watch classes in progress. In August, the Gaelic Mod gathers Scots old and Nova for a grand competition.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Avalon Peninsula<n>The drive south down the peninsula from St. John’s takes you first out to Cape Spear, a windswept rocky promontory jutting out into the crashing waves of the Atlantic — easternmost point of North America (longitude 52°37’24”). This strategic position prompted the Americans to install two anti-submarine gun emplacements on the tip of the cape in World War II. The 1835 white clapboard lighthouse here has been restored with a jolly red-and-white striped dome, while a less-attractive modern concrete tower does all the work. Down at the bird sanctuary on Witless Bay, you can spot penguins, puffins, guillemots, and little auks. Best sightings are from mid-June to mid-July, when you can hire a boat from Bay Bulls out to Gull Island.<n>Marine Drive, north of St. John’s, takes you up a characteristically craggy coast through the fishing villages of Outer Cove, Middle Cove, and Torbay up to pretty Pouch Cove. Look out for the whales that pass down this coast in summer. On the shore, you’ll see the wooden trestled racks on which fishermen still dry their cod in the time-honored manner. For a view of Newfoundland at its wildest and most magnificently desolate, drive beyond Marine Drive on the gravel road leading to Cape St. Francis.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt

Stanley Park<n>Covering a magnificent peninsula proudly dominating English Bay, this is undoubtedly one of North America’s finest city parks. Its forest of majestic Douglas firs, cedars, and Sitka spruce remind us it was once a government reserve providing mast and spar timbers for the Royal Navy. At the turn of the century, the town leased it as a park, named after Lord Stanley, Canada’s governor general. His bronze statue is close to the southern entrance. Turn east off Georgia Street to take the 9-km (51/2-mile) drive looping the park. More bracing is the Sea Wall Promenade, where you can walk, jog, or ride a bicycle (available for rent at the park entrance). Passing the immaculate green playing field of Brockton Oval, you may spot a cricket game, reminding you this is British Columbia. A splendid group of Haida and Kwakiutl totem poles nearby illustrate the province’s other important cultural influence. On your way to Brockton Point, listen for the 9 o’clock gun, a cannon that fires at 9pm, originally to warn fishermen of the fishing curfew.<n>Turning west, you’ll pass on the seaward side a bronze statue oddly named Girl in a Wet Suit, a version of Copenhagen’s mermaid designed not to shock. Stop off at Prospect Point for a good view of oil tankers and grain cargo ships bound for Japan, China, or Russia. A totem pole marks the site where Captain Vancouver met with members of the Squamish tribe.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt

You can picnic at the bottom of the cliff over which the water cascades. Famous for its August log-rolling contests, the town of Squamish makes a useful base for hiking tours into Garibaldi Provincial Park. The winter sports resort of Whistler offers excellent summer facilities, too: bicycles, kayak and river-rafting or more sedate swimming, golf, and tennis. Take the ski-lift for views across the Coastal Mountains or stroll around Lost Lake — good trout-fishing — but beware of a pretty yellow flower known as skunk cabbage that smells like its name when you pick it.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The highway through the Monashee and Selkirk mountains to Mount Revelstoke National Park follows the Eagle River and the route of the C.P.R. on the crucial stretch that enabled the railway to break through the Rockies. At Craigellachie, right beside the road, about 25 km (15 miles) east of Shuswap Lake, a granite monolith marks the spot where the eastern and western sections linked up to form Canada’s first transcontinental railway. At 9:22am on November 7, 1885, surrounded by top-hatted dignitaries and grimy overalled laborers, C.P.R. boss Donald Smith tucked in his flowing white beard and hammered home the famous Last Spike — after misjudging his first swing and bending a first spike over double.<n>Leave the Trans-Canada 11/2 km (1 mile) east of Revelstoke town to drive the winding Summit Road up Mount Revelstoke, 2,120 m (6,370 ft), the only mountain in Canada that you can “climb” by car. This is the cozy way to watch the park’s landscape change from dense lowland forest, through alpine meadows dotted with wild flowers, to the bleak tundra of the high country. From the top you look out over the Columbia and Illecillewaet river valleys and back to the Monashee Mountains. There are no campgrounds inside the park, but if you’re planning to tent overnight along the 65 km (39 miles) of clearly marked hiking-trails, check in with the park administration office in downtown Revelstoke (P.O. Box 350, Revelstoke, B.C. VOE250; tel. 250-837-7500). This is the place to get your detailed maps and fishing permit. In the creeks and lakes, you’ll find an abundance of trout — rainbow, brook, brown, cut-throat, and red-spotted Dolly Varden — as well as whitefish, char, and bass. Nature-lovers may spot elk, moose, and mountain goat, bird-watchers look for grey jay, blue grouse, and golden eagle, while everyone should watch out for black bear.<n>The Trans-Canada continues through the jagged mountains of Glacier National Park, which counts over 400 glaciers within its boundaries. Rogers’ Pass was named after the major who found this corridor in 1882, thus enabling the C.P.R. to cut through the avalanche-prone Selkirk Mountains. It was also the toughest obstacle to clear for completion of the Trans-Canada Highway in 1962.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The first and most famous of Canada’s national parks began, as so many things in this country, with the railways. When the C.P.R. reached Banff in 1883, the Rockies were suddenly opened up to public access, and the government decided, two years later, to preserve the region’s beauty by declaring Banff a national park.<n>After three railway workers discovered hot sulfur springs bubbling from the earth, their bosses built one of their grandest castle-hotels, the Banff Springs, a monument to be visited even if you’re not staying there. The turreted edifice set down in the Bow River Valley has something of the fairytale castles of Ludwig of Bavaria. Take a canoe out on the river. If you’re feeling less energetic, take the waters at the Cave and Basin Springs, 3 km (2 miles) west of the hotel, or the Upper Hot Springs, a short drive south. The springs are 29°C (85°F) in winter, rising to 42°C (108°F) in summer. The eight-minute cable car ride from Upper Hot Springs up Sulfur Mountain (2,500 m/7,500 ft) will give you a panoramic view of the mountains around the Bow Valley.<n>One of many fine excursions is the drive along Bow Valley Parkway (Highway 1A), then a hike along the marked trail beside the rapids to the lower and upper waterfalls in Johnston Canyon. Back on the Trans-Canada Highway towards Lake Louise, look to the east for the crenellated silhouette of Castle Mountain, 3,000 m (9,000 ft) high.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt

Icefields Parkway<n>This 233-km (140-mile) drive on Highway 93, up the spine of the mountain range from Lake Louise to Jasper, gives a rich sense of the Rockies’ varied beauties —  glaciers, waterfalls, lakes, and canyons. Take a full day so that you have time to explore some of the sights on foot. Stop first at the Crowfoot Glacier, where you can see the foot’s two remaining “toes,” the third having broken away. The mass of ice facing you is 55 m (165 ft) thick. At Bow Summit, leave the Parkway at the signpost to the viewpoint overlooking the lovely Peyto Lake, a deep turquoise at the height of summer. If you have time, stop at Kilometer 119 on the Parkway, to hike up the winding path to Parker’s Ridge (2,185 m/6,560 ft) above pretty alpine meadows overlooking the Saskatchewan Glacier, the beginning of the great North Saskatchewan River that ends up in Hudson Bay.<n>Inside Jasper National Park, put on good rubber or crepesoled shoes to walk out onto the ice of Athabasca Glacier, part of the Columbia Icefield. You can also venture onto the ice sheet in a snowmobile. Note the rock debris or rubble (moraine in the language of glaciologists) in front of the glacier showing that the Athabasca is retreating — a hundred years ago it reached to the other side of the Parkway. At the Parkway’s Kilometer 200 mark, take Highway 93A to Athabasca Falls. A comfortable boardwalk leads you on an informative nature walk right up to where the mighty river plunges over the narrow gorge.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt

Take the Jasper Tramway ride up Whistlers Mountain for a view of the Rockies’ highest peak, Mount Robson. One of the most attractive excursions is the drive along Maligne Canyon. Stop off to look down into the sheer limestone gorge at the roiling waters, sudden cascades, and tranquil pools. At the end of the canyon is Maligne Lake, where the great attraction is a boat cruise around the picturesque Spirit Island.<n>Alberta<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Drumheller<n>The area around this old coalmining town is famous for the prehistoric fossils and remarkably complete remains of dinosaurs whose stamping grounds were the Badlands of the Red Deer River Valley. The 130-km (78-mile) drive northeast of Calgary on Highway 9 takes you through wheat-growing country where you may see the farming communities of Hutterites, an austere religious sect originally from Slovakia, often persecuted for their pacifism. The women wear traditional dirndl costumes with headscarf and apron, while their husbands, dressed all in black with broad-rimmed hats, cultivate the heavy beards of Old Testament prophets.<n>Drumheller’s Dinosaur Trail places fossils and life-size models of the beasts in their original habitat — though you have to imagine a luxuriant humid jungle in place of the present-day arid desert. Looping 48 km (29 miles) round the Red Deer River, the trail starts out at Drumheller’s fossil museum, 335 First Street, devoted mainly to the region’s geology. But for a most exciting confrontation with the prehistoric world of dinosaurs, make for the new Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology on the Midland provincial park’s North Dinosaur Trail. This beautifully organized museum, drawing on the most modern audiovisual techniques, is named after Joseph Tyrrell, the geologist who made the first discovery of Alberta’s 65-million-year-old dinosaurs while surveying coal seams along the Red Deer River in 1884. Drawing on some of the finest of the 200 creatures unearthed in the area, the Tyrrell museum recreates jungle environments for superbly reconstructed skeletons and models, including Tyrrell’s Albertosaurus, the awesome Tyrannosaurus rex, measuring 15 m (45 ft) long and 6 m (19 ft) tall in its cotton socks, and the “tiny” but most lovable of all, a duck-billed Lambeosaurus, just 3 m (10 ft) tall, followed by her baby.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Edmonton<n>You can see the source of the provincial capital’s wealth as you drive in from the airport. On the southern outskirts of town on Highway 2 are the derricks and “grasshopper” pumps that have characterized Edmonton since the oil strike at the great well of Leduc Number 1 in 1947. But the town has created another treasure trove in the astounding West Edmonton Mall (Stony Plain Road, Highway 16), a shopping center to end all shopping centers, complete with a waterpark and attracting as many as 140,000 customers on a busy day, 40 per cent of them from the United States.<n>If you want a view of the whole city and the North Saskatchewan River on your way home, stop off at Vista 33, the observation level of the telephone building.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The old French-speaking community of St-Boniface, now a Winnipeg suburb, is on the east side of the Red River. Its Avenue Taché boasts the city’s oldest building, the 1846 convent of the Grey Nuns. It’s now the parish museum, devoted in part to the life of Louis Riel. Next door, you’ll find his simple grave in the cemetery of St-Boniface basilica, rebuilt behind its white stone façade after a recent fire.<n>Children enjoy the 2-hour ride in the four wooden coaches and caboose of the Prairie Dog Central steam train, from St. James Station to and from Grosse Isle, 25 km (15 miles) northwest of town.

Wildlife tours around the bay and across the otherwise inaccessible hinterland are organized in giant-wheeled or half-track tundra buggies (half- and full-day excursions or overnight camping trips). Several boat tours explore the bay for close-up sightings of beluga whale and cruise over to the ruins of Fort Prince of Wales on a promontory at the mouth of the Churchill River. The Hudson’s Bay Company’s massive stone fortress surrendered to the French navigator La Pérouse in 1782, without firing a single shot.<n>If you want to explore on your own, rent a car and drive round the harbor and its monumental grain elevators on the way to Cape Merry for a good view of the fort, especially at sunset. Take your binoculars to follow the beluga whales that swim with the summer tide in and out of the river estuary.<n>THE NORTH<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Though a thoroughly modern town with a population of 23,000, the Yukon capital is proud of its Old Log Church on Elliot Street and some three-story log cabins it calls “wooden skyscrapers.” One of them houses the MacBride Museum (First Avenue), with a good collection of gold rush memorabilia and exhibits of Yukon wildlife.<n>You can visit a sternwheel riverboat, the S.S. Klondike, moored at the end of Second Avenue. Upriver, 3 km (2 miles) south of town, take a 2-hour cruise through Miles Canyon on the M.V. Schwatka. At Black Mike’s Gold Mine, a 30-km (18-mile) drive south of Whitehorse, you can try your own hand at panning for gold.<n>Dawson City<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Dawson City<n>A day’s drive from Whitehorse along the Klondike Highway, the old boomtown counts scarcely 1,000 inhabitants today, but the national parks system has done a nice tongue-in-cheek job of reconstructing the monuments of its heyday. The history of Dawson City is further celebrated by a couple of annual events. This is the place to be in the week of August 17, Discovery Day, for the Klondike River raft-races, costumed street-parades, music, and dancing. If you miss it, look out for the Outhouse-On-Wheels race at the beginning of September.<n>One of the town’s major year-round attractions is Diamond Tooth Gertie’s Gambling Hall, an old-fashioned (and legal) casino, where red-gartered dancing girls kick it up to a honky-tonk piano. The gaudy Palace Grand Theatre is famous for its vaudeville, Gaslight Follies.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Go-carting. The carts never travel too quickly and are so low to the ground that they can’t tip over. However, being so low they also give a thrilling sensation of speed, and your only problem will be getting your child off when it’s time to go. Adult drivers are usually welcome too.<n>Karting Club Tenerife Arona (ten minutes from Playa de las Américas) has a normal speed track (admission: 1,300 ptas, [es]7.81), and a fast track (admission: 1,900 ptas, r11.42), and various other facilities. Open daily 10am–8pm. Gran Karting Club, Maspalomas (on Gran Canaria). An eight-minute drive will cost 1,500 ptas, r9.02 Gran Karting Club (2 km {about a mile}from the Lanzarote airport) has a senior track that is 1,281 m (1,400 yards) long with go-carts that can reach 80 Kph. (1,500 ptas, r9.02 for 8 minutes). There is also a junior track, 865 m (880 yards). Admission is 1,000 ptas, r6.01 for (ages 12–16), and 600 ptas, r3.61 (ages 5–11).<n>Go sailing. There are numerous trips throughout the islands on a variety of vessels and memorable whale and dolphin safaris for spotting pilot whales and friendly porpoises.

Population: 666,000<n>Tenerife is not only the largest of the Canaries geographically, it also offers the tourist more sights, more attractions, more towns and cities to explore, and more contrasts than any of the other islands. Where else can you look around a banana plantation and then take a short drive half-way up a mountain for a snowball fight?<n>Tenerife has been welcoming visitors from cold northern climes since the 19th century. However, the focus has changed from the cloudy, green north coast where Puerto de la Cruz was once the favorite resort (it is still enormously popular), to the hot, dry, arid south.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
Continue west on the coast road from Icod to Garachico and after 6 km (3.7 miles) the tortuous descent begins. There are marvelous views looking directly down onto this compact little town of 6,000 inhabitants, set on a small peninsula with the waves crashing all around. The peninsula is actually formed from the volcanic debris that was deposited following a disastrous eruption in 1706, when most of the town and its inhabitants were destroyed. The best place to survey the aftermath of the petrified lava is from the beautifully preserved 16th-century Castillo de San Miguel. A lucky survivor, this fortress (note the heraldic arms above the doorway), is now devoted to handicraft sales. There is no beach to speak of here, but a very cleverly designed set of pools built into the rocks more than compensates. Despite the destruction, Garachico is a little gem. Neat houses boasting typically attractive Canarian balconies line cobbled streets, and old churches adorn pretty squares. Unmissable, also, is the large, uninhabited rock out in the bay, and it has managed to gain for itself a place in the spiritual life of Garachico. Without a patron saint of its own, the town has elevated the rock to be its saint!<n>Farther along the coast road, 8 km (5 miles) past Buenavista del Norte, lies the most westerly point on Tenerife, the Punta de Teno. From here there are panoramic views across to La Gomera and looking south to the massive cliffs of Los Gigantes. Turn back to Buenavista and take a marked turn inland to Masca. Be warned, though, this is absolutely not a drive to be undertaken by inexperienced or nervous drivers. Initially the road, although ascending through the arable mountainside, is no problem; but this soon changes once the entrance to the vertiginous valley is reached. One glance at the narrow, steeply twisting road on either side will be enough to realize why, up to only a few years ago, the picturesque tiny village of Masca could only be reached on the back of a donkey. All around is some of the most dramatic scenery on the island. However, if you are driving, you won’t have any time to savor it. The road clings precariously to the side of lush, green mountains cleft by deep, dark ravines and often zig-zags on itself in the tightest of hairpin bends. And it is far from unknown to have to reverse back down and around these bends, allowing other vehicles to pass. A stop at Masca is not just a pleasure, but also a relief. Relax at one of the restaurants down from the road, and enjoy the stupendous scenery before continuing south on an equally difficult drive, to rejoin the main road at Santiago del Teide.<n>A little farther south, turn off towards Puerto de Santiago, then walk out to the edge of the marina jetty to get the best view of the enormous sheer cliffs, up to 800 m (2,625 ft) high, known appropriately as Los Gigantes (The Giants).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
On the other side of Playa de las Américas, but with a border as indistinguishable as that with Los Cristianos, is the newly popular area of Costa Adeje, but here it really is rather different. The wall-to-wall hotels, fast food places and other such popular activities with the English and Germans gives way to much more elegant, spacious, cleverly designed resort hotels offering such extensive facilities that you don’t even have to leave the property — creating a much more agreeable ambiance than that of its two near neighbors.<n>There is, of course, no shortage of entertainment facilities, and Puerto de Colón has become not just a favorite place to wander around and watch the boats, but a center for some really neat and unusual adventures that merit description. A submarine trip will appeal to most people and Submarine Adventure will take you under the ocean on a 45-minute trip in their yellow submarine. Through the picture windows you can monitor the progress, and the fish, yourselves. The highlight is when the submarine passes some wrecks on the sea bed which have become a haven for fish, notably an array of stingrays, some of which are frighteningly huge. Safari B.O.B. Diving has a more novel way of getting you underwater. B.O.B. stands for Breathing Observatory Bubble, and these are said to be the first in Europe. It is rather like a vertical scooter, and consists of a large bubble over your head and a steering apparatus by your waist. You get about 20 minutes of submerged time in the waters north of the port (open Monday–Thursday; Saturday.), and the cost is 6,500 ptas, r39.07 per person. Speed Boat Safari, NautiOcio Watersports is the latest, and fastest, water adventure; following an instructor you will drive your own boat exploring small bays and caves and stopping for swimming and snorkeling (all equipment provided: 10,000 ptas, r60.10 per person).<n>El Hierro<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
Just off the coast road is the Cenobio de Valerón (Convent of Valerón). This is badly sign-posted. Take the turn off just before Guía, away from the sea. This convent is actually a series of Guanche caves cut into a steep mountainside. According to island lore, the daughters of noble families spent their youth in these small cells serving the native gods. At the age of 15 they were allowed to marry or to remain in the sanctuary for life. More prosaically, the caves were probably also used for grain storage. Around this area, you could spy some modern cave dwellers.<n>Continue south towards Agaete, which is the most attractive of the small northern towns. Agaete’s port, Puerto de las Nieves, is a haven of calm among the formidable rocky cliffs that make up this inhospitable stretch of coast. From here the coast road ascends very sharply amid sparse, windblown greenery, and the drop seawards can be frighteningly steep. An alternative route is to drive 7 km (4 miles) inland to the fine viewpoint at Los Berrazales.<n>Central Sights<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
From Las Palmas you have two options. The most northern route runs through the peaceful valley town of Teror. The old whitewashed houses, often built around graceful patios, boast fine traditional carved balconies. The major landmark here is a typically large Canarian church, the Basílica Nuestra Señora del Pino (Our Lady of the Pine). This commemorates the miraculous discovery in 1481, in the branches of a pine tree, of a sacred effigy. The Blessed Virgin of Teror is also the patron saint of Gran Canaria. Alternatively, take the main road that runs inland from close to the cathedral and heads southwest through the towns of Santa Brígida and Vega de San Mateo, offering panoramic views of the east of the island. Because the climate here is exceptionally mild, many Canarians and foreign residents have built very desirable homes in these hills, with the gardens around their villas often being magnificent. A small diversion along this route is certainly worthwhile. Just a few kilometers out of Las Palmas, follow the signs to Bandama, the road (open 8am–10pm) leads up to the nearby Caldera de Bandama, one of the island’s finest natural features and a spectacular mirador in its own right. This volcanic crater, almost a kilometer (more than a half mile) across, is green, fertile.and drops some 198 m (650 ft) down. A scenic spiraling road leads to the top, where the Real Club de Golf enjoys such a picturesque location that even non-golfers are tempted to pick up a club. The views from here take in the mountains, fertile valley and vast stretches of the coastline from Las Palmas to the distant south.<n>From the west of the island drive north from Agaete and then turn inland following the signs to Tejeda for a really pleasant, and not unduly difficult, mountain ascent. The valleys here are wide and their slopes play host to some small farms; it is one of the few places in the islands where you will come across farm animals. Of interest, too, are the fantastic views across the ocean on a fine day to the snowcapped Mount Teide floating majestically above the clouds and the mountain peaks and lush valleys of Gran Canaria itself. Before reaching Tejeda turn off to the village of Artenara, to the southwest, and what is undoubtedly the best restaurant view on the island. The place in question is Méson de la Silla, not easy to spot, parallel to the main road. A dark tunnel leads through the rock with no hint of what is to come, then emerges on the other side of the mountain to a bright 180-degree mountain panorama. To the left the head of the valley, green and dotted with whitewashed little villages; it leads up to Tejeda itself, but the more dramatic vistas are directly in front and to the right. Here, the scenario is dramatic indeed; jagged peaks fill the horizon and many smaller ones are spread throughout the valley giving the impression of looking down on a minor mountain range.<n>Lanzarote<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
At the northern tip of the island is the small fishing port of Orzola. This is the embarkation point for the tiny island of Graciosa, a ferry service run by Líneas Maritimas Romero four times a day (July–Sep) and three times the rest of the year. With superb beaches and a complete lack of tourist development, this is the place to get away from it all for the day.<n>For an unforgettable view of Isla Graciosa and much more, drive up to the Mirador del Río (admission: 400 ptas, r2.40). This is yet another of César Manrique’s creations, and one that certainly shouldn’t be missed. The views from here really are wonderful indeed, and it is probably the most spectacular mirador in all the Canaries. Huge cliffs curve down to the beach with Graciosa just across the water and with the two other smaller islands, Montaña Clara and Alegranza, in the background. Combined with Graciosa and a small section of the northwest coastline of Lanzarote, they form the Parque Nacional del Archipiélago Chinijo. The only sound here is that of the wind gently whistling through El Río, the waterway separating Lanzarote and Graciosa. Besides its huge picture windows, note in the bar/restaurant some more of Manrique’s creative sculptures.<n>Another addition to the island’s burgeoning tourist attractions is the Guinate Tropical Bird Park, just south of the Mirador del Río. Within its 45,000 square m (11.1 acres) of carefully tended landscaped gardens you will find over 1,300 species of rare and exotic birds and animals, a new area where you can discover the world of Tamarind monkeys, and of course, performing parrots entertain in the theatre.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
The central mountain range is encircled by two roads: the FV-20 that initially heads west from Puerto del Rosario then drops south alongside the mountains to Antigua and Tuineje before meeting up with the main north to south FV-2 just north of Gran Tarajal; and the FV-30 that loops around, off the FV-20 north of the range, dropping into the Betancuria valley and continuing south through winding terrain to Pájara and Tuinije, where it meets up again with the FV-20. As you can join this loop from the north, south or center, and even cut across the mountains at one point, you can start out from most parts of the island. Starting from Puerto del Rosario take the FV-30 diversion off the FV-20 and follow it until you see the signs for the Mirador de Morro Velosa; soon a gate man will demand 300 ptas, r1.80 per person, but this will prove to be a worthwhile investment. At the summit and with commanding views of the surrounding mountains and with the Atlantic Ocean shimmering in the distance, is a delightful combination of café, bar and viewpoint that owes its creative design to none other than César Manrique.<n>Betancuria, by far the most attractive and visited inland town on the island, is an oasis of greenery on this barren island. Although the riverbed here is almost perpetually dry, the town is fortunate to have a high water table. Because of its theoretical invulnerability at the heart of the island, it was made Fuerteventura’s first capital in the early 15th century. However, in 1539 somehow the ravaging Berber pirates overcame the mountains (which still provide a difficult drive today), and destroyed the original cathedral. The present 17th-century church, Iglesia de Santa María is a splendid building and hosts many interesting treasures. Look at the unusual wooden beams between the flagstones on the floor, the wooden altar and choir, and the decorated pulpit. Adjacent to the museum is a leather factory-cum-shoe-shop, set in an atmospheric old building. Wander round this lovely little town and admire the view from across the bridge, where there is an unpretentious restaurant/bar and a gift shop. Just south of Betancuria is the neat and pretty village of Pájara, but a stop at Antigua, on the other side of the mountains is in order. This is reached either by continuing on the loop past Tuineje, or backtracking from Betancuria and taking the FV-416 across the mountains. In either event, once in Antigua — the island’s capital from 1834–1835 — you can’t miss the traditional old windmill found just to the north of town, and this is your destination. Actually, the Centro de Artesania “Molino de Antigua” (Windmill Crafts Center) is much more than just that, and has something for almost everyone’s tastes. Interesting crafts and a visit inside the windmill certainly, but also ethnographic and archaeological exhibitions, modern art, an audiovisual room, rooftop view- points and an intriguing cactus garden, not to mention a nice restaurant.<n>Of the coastline south of Puerto del Rosario, the new cosmopolitan development of El Castillo, also known as Caleta de Fuste, is of most interest. Activities here focus around the attractive, horseshoe-shaped beach (where windsurfing is a particularly popular sport), and the well-designed marina. In the marina, there is an area where you can view the fish that frequent its waters, and a small number of activities use the harbor as a homeport. The Oceanarium is a catamaran that will take you out to visit the dolphins and whales, and the Nautilus is a semi-submersible submarine that has twenty individual seats.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
South of San Miguel, you will find the major cruise port at La Ceiba, around 3 km (2 miles) from town. Several large cruise vessels dock each week, bringing a flurry of activity; taxi drivers increase their speed to make the most of the business. There is a good beach at La Ceiba and a number of hotels, plus several dive outfits have bases here — you can book a class or rent equipment. Farther south, in the ocean offshore, the reef holds the attention of even the most experienced divers because of its variety of animal and coral life. Turtles, rays, sharks, and many species of colorful tropical fish can be found here, many at a reasonable depth for novice divers — though the reef walls are better left to those with experience. The booking office for Atlantis Submarine is also here; this mini-submersible is ideal for non-divers, allowing a glimpse of the thriving underwater world without your having to get wet.<n>South of the cruise port, the road (currently in the process of being upgraded) leads away from the urban development and out into the countryside. This part of the island has some of the best and most sheltered beaches. In recent years, a number of excellent resort hotels have been built on large plots of land; you will see their gated entrances as you drive by. Next to these are the more modest accommodations that for years have catered to dedicated divers.<n>Around 5 km (3 miles) from town you will find the entrance to Chankanaab State Park. This was one of the first sites on the island to offer organized reef snorkeling in an offshore lagoon, though as it became more popular it developed other attractions. Snorkeling is still extremely good offshore, though the lagoon site is now devoid of marine life and is used simply as a safe swimming area. Chankanaab offers a botanical garden and a sculpture park displaying native art from all areas of Mexico. It has a dive shop, beach umbrellas, sun beds, and two restaurants. Perhaps the prize of the park goes to the “Swim with the Dolphins” program. The dolphins are kept in open water just offshore and reached by a wooden walkway. Small groups of people can enter the water with the dolphins; an instructor controls the activities and exercises.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
The very southern tip of the island is a national park, protected from the development, which threatened its wild but fragile environment. The Parque Punta Sur (South Point Park) was opened in August 1999. Access is not permitted by car, but the park provides electric bicycles, buggies, and a colorful open-sided tour bus to give access to the interior; two hours of free cycle use is included with the entry ticket. Next to the car park where you leave your vehicle, and information center provides details about the park and its flora and fauna. Within Punta Sur’s 1,100 hectares (2,718 acres) are the coast, with its wild beaches and sand dunes, and the interior, lagoons and mangrove swamps with a population of crocodiles and bird species. You can explore Punta Celerain, the most southerly point of Cozumel and now part of the park, and Punta Celerain Lighthouse, once protector of shipping in the area, and now refurbished to house the Museo de la Navegación (Navigation Museum). A series of dioramas in both Spanish and English explain navigation methods through the ages, including those of the Maya who lived in the region. One room in the museum is dedicated to the lighthouse-keepers and their families, who lived here full time, often cut off from the rest of the population in San Miguel.<n>From Punta Sur the main highway heads north up the eastern coastline. The conditions here offer quite a contrast to the west, with the waves of the Caribbean lashing against limestone rocks, and the low vegetation leaning inward, blown by the sea breezes. The whole area has a stark and wild beauty, reminiscent perhaps of the time when Cozumel was the haunt of pirates and renegades. The tidal surge is very strong here, so swimming and snorkeling are not advised. Other than a few farms, there is little development until you reach Playa Morena, with its bar and souvenir stand. Here the road makes a sharp left turn to cut across the heart of the island. If you wish to continue north from here (on foot, horseback, or four-wheel drive vehicle), you will eventually reach the northern lighthouse at Punta Molas, having passed the Mayan ruins of El Castillo Real along the way. Take the sensible precautions if you make this trip — drinking water, sun protection, insect repellent, and an extra layer of clothing are all advisable.<n>The road leading back to San Miguel, called the Carretera Transversal, hosts a few souvenir stands where prices may be a little lower than in town — if you’re prepared to barter. Six km (4 miles) from Playa Morena is the entrance to the San Gervasio Archaeological Park. The remains of San Gervasio are located several kilometers from the site entrance, and though not on the scale of the major Mayan settlements of the mainland, the beautiful tropical park environment makes the ruins worth exploring. Most structures date from the post-classical period (1200–1650); the site was still in use when the Spanish arrived. At the Estructura Manitas (Little Hands Structure), you can clearly see the red handprints, dating from around 1000, on the inside wall of the temple. From here you can walk the route of a short sacred sacbé (Mayan road) to the central collection of small buildings. One is El Osario (Ossuary Structure), where the remains of several Maya were found. Some 500 m (1,524 ft) behind here is Kana Nah (Tall House), which, as its name suggests, is one of the largest structures at the site. It was the main temple, where the goddess Ix chel was worshipped.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
The other big temple in town, Shanhua Monastery, faces the old city wall, which is undergoing renovation. The monastery dates from the Tang Dynasty, but it was largely rebuilt after a fire. Standing in the grand, red-walled pavilion are 24 celestial guardians, each of distinct mien. A circular “moon gate” in the side wall of the monastery leads to the Five Dragon Wall (Wulongbi), transplanted here from a former Confucian temple. This ceramic screen resembles the lavish Nine Dragon Wall in the town center, but here the middle dragon, terrifyingly, faces forward.<n>A major attraction near Datong is the Temple Suspended Over the Void (Xuankongsi), situated a two-hour drive south through a barren sandstone plateau. Tours usually stop along the way at one of the area’s cave houses, where residents are happy to show off their hand-dug quarters. The sixth-century temple is spectacular, with over 40 halls and pavilions which are joined by ornate catwalks, suspended as if by magic on the face of a sheer limestone cliff.<n>Yungang Caves<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Leshan<n>From the provincial capital of Chengdu, a three-hour drive via a new expressway through populous Sichuan (Szechuan) Province ends at the town of Leshan, the base for visits to a monumental riverside Buddha and to one of four sacred mountains of Chinese Buddhism, Emeishan. A 13th-century poet wrote that the most beautiful scenery of China is found in Sichuan, and, indeed, some of the best of that scenery is concentrated in Leshan. Here, three rivers converge and flow along the city wall, and far away in the mist rises Mt. Emei.<n>Open boats ferry visitors from Leshan to the site of the Great Buddha (Dafo). Whether seen from the river or, later, from the hillsides, the world’s largest seated Buddha is an impressive spectacle. Carved from the cliffside by a monk starting in the year 713, its height is 71 m (233 ft). The statue’s feet are so big that a hundred people can sit on each instep.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
North of Málaga<n>Just an hour’s drive north of Málaga lies some magnificent mountain scenery. The national park of El Torcal de Antequera is a high limestone plateau that has been eroded by rainwater into a fantasy landscape of fluted pinnacles and towers. Hikers can explore the marked trails, which are up to 5 km (3 miles) in length and wind among the rocks, and enjoy panoramic views back to Málaga and the distant blue Mediterranean. This is where you will also find a most wonderful small hotel, La Posada del Torcal.<n>Near the town of Alora, you will find the breathtaking gorge known as the Garganta del Chorro. Three hundred meters (1,000 feet) in depth, this sheer-sided canyon is cut by the Guadalhorce River. It is also accessible from Málaga by train; ask for a ticket to El Chorro. An improbable concrete catwalk called the Camino del Rey (The King’s Way) crosses a vertical cliff and continues into the heart of the gorge, a dizzying 65 m (200 ft) above the river. It was built in the 1920s to provide access for workers digging tunnels for a hydroelectricity project. The artificial dams above the gorge have created attractive lakes, known as the Pantanos del Chorro. Fringed with woods, sandy beaches, and campsites, they constitute a refreshing change of scenery from the heat and bustle of the coast.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Inland Excursions<n>For a complete contrast to the sun, sea, and sangría atmosphere of the coast, you need only drive inland for a few hours to reach the cultural, historical, and architectural attractions of Ronda, Jerez de la Frontera, Sevilla, Córdoba and Granada — the great cities of Andalucía. If your time is limited, try one of the day trips offered in all the major resorts or focus your attention on Ronda. Most of the other destinations require an overnight stay.<n>Ronda<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Doñana National Park This is probably the most famous park in Spain. It holds many national and international honors, and is even listed as a World Heritage Site. Consisting of 86,208 hectares (213,020 acres), it is bordered on two sides by the Atlantic Ocean and the Guadalquivir River as it winds its way down from Sevilla to reach the ocean at Sanlúcar de Barrameda. In fact, Doñana is the last great lowland wilderness sanctuary in southern Europe, and has three distinct ecosystems: the marismas (salt marshes), matorral (brushwood), and las dunas (sand dunes). Within its bounds can be found an amazing array of animal, bird, and plant life, but what you see is very much dependent upon the time of year you visit and, even then, can be very hit or miss.<n>The only way to really see the park is on a tour organized by Coop. Andaluz Marismas del Rocio, whose large-wheel buses depart from the visitors’ center at El Acebuche. Be forewarned, though: this is a very bumpy, rough ride, and definitely not advisable for those with artificial hips or physical handicaps. Lasting about four hours, it enters the sand dunes at Matalascañas and the first part of the trip is along 35 km (nearly 20 miles) of unspoiled beaches. The only human residents here are the fishermen living in what look like very ramshackle huts, albeit with 4-wheel drive vehicles and TV antennas on display. The vast stretches of salt marshes are fascinating, with many animals living along the edge of the grassland adjoining them. The huge sand dunes, perpetually changing, make for a surreal sight.<n>Laguna de Medina Across the Guadalquivir and just about 10 km (6 miles) east of Jerez de la Frontera is this small lake, one of the last stops in Europe for birds migrating south from northern and central Europe to Africa at the end of August. In periods of drought it is attractive to birds that usually reside at Doñana, and around 50 species have been observed here.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
On the road to Knossós, look for the Natural History Museum of Crete — an often overlooked attraction but worthwhile for those who enjoy geology, flora, and fauna. Exhibits concentrate on endemic species and the diverse environments that Crete has to offer. It also examines man’s effect on the island from his earliest arrival to the present day.<n>Other classical sites lay below Iráklion near the south coast. Take the road to Agía Vavára, in a vine-filled valley skirting the looming mountains of the Ida range to the west. Here you’ll find the Messará Plain, a wide fertile valley surrounded by hills, which has been a center for farming since ancient times. For a pretty drive along the upper reaches of the valley, take the road to Zarós from Agía Vavára. The scenery is magnificent and you can visit Moní Vrontisí, a small monastery in the hills above the town, which was the original home of the Damaskinós icons — now in Agía Ekaterínis in Iráklion. This road leads through the villages of Kamáres where there is a large cave, and links up with the Amari Valley to the west (see page 62).<n>To reach the ancient sites drop down from Agía Vavára on to the Plain. Near the village of Agía Déka — named after ten saints who were martyred here — and widely scattered in farmland, are the remains of Górtis (Gortyn), capital of the island during the Roman era (from 65 b.c.) and also an important city in Minoan times.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Beyond you’ll find the tiny Barrio de Santa Cruz. This quarter is all that remains of the Villa Vieja, or old town. You can still see fascinating glimpses of traditional narrow streets where houses are decorated with potted plants and wrought-iron grilles.<n>From this barrio you’ll be able to see the most prominent sight in Alicante, the historic Castillo de Santa Bárbara, perched 115 metres (350 feet) above the city on Mount Benacantil. The site has been fortified since prehistoric times and offers beautiful views of Aitana, San Juan, Santa Pola, and Benidorm and Tabarca islands in the distance. To get to the castle, drive up the winding road to the summit or use the lift at the far end of Calle Juan Bautista Lafora, close to Postiguet beach. Santa Bárbara, built by the Carthaginians in the third century b.c., was so well fortified that for nearly 2,000 years nobody conquered it. Only when the French succeeded in blowing up part of the garrison, during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1707, was the castle taken.<n>On the opposite side of town in the Barrio San Blas is the smaller Castillo de San Fernando, begun during the War of Independence (1808–1814). The castle, set above the trees of the small Parque Municipal, provides a favourite spot for viewing Santa Bárbara and the port in the late afternoon.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
Inland from Alicante<n>For a change of scenery, drive north of Alicante into the rocky, lunar-like landscape of the Cabeço d’Or mountains. This is where you’ll find the Cuevas de Canalobre (Candelabrum Cave), which is reached by following the N-340 from San Juan de Alicante until the turn-off for Busot, where signs mark the way to the cave. Floodlights dramatize the eerie ranks of gigantic stalagmites and stalactites, which crowd chambers up to 115 metres (350 feet) high. The acoustics are so exceptional that summer concerts are held in the caves.<n>Jijona also lies within easy reach of the provincial capital. This town, just 27 km (14 miles) from Alicante on the N-340, is renowned for the manufacture of turrón, an exotic sweet of Moorish origin, made from ground almonds, orange-blossom honey, egg white, and sugar. Traditionally served by the Spanish at Christmas time, the flat bars of turrón are very hard. A softer, sweeter version called torta de turrón is oval and made with extra honey and whole almonds. You can learn all about this popular confection on a tour of El Lobo factory, founded in 1725. There’s even a small museum on the premises.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
The North Coast<n>The Costa Blanca’s reputation for magnificent beaches and lively resorts comes from the northern stretch of coast. Take the N-332 from Alicante and drive through Campello to the fishing port of Villajoyosa. This picturesque village, some 30 km (18 miles) from the provincial capital, is more authentically Spanish in character than Benidorm, its cosmopolitan neighbour.<n>Wind your way towards the sea through the narrow streets of the old town, and suddenly you’ll see a group of housefronts in sun-bleached blues, pinks, and yellows. White-rimmed doors and windows, black wrought-iron grilles, green blinds, and a massive Gothic church give the impression of a sparkling diadem — but then Villajoyosa literally means “Jewelled Town.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
Directly above the old town, the Ermita de San Feliú (Saint Felix’s Hermitage) commands a wide view. Although it has been a Christian bastion since the third century, it was a pagan sacrificial site long before that. Continue uphill to the fortress, which is, in fact, two castles. Ramparts connect the smaller pre-Roman Castillo Menor (Small Castle) with the Roman and post-Roman Castillo Mayor (Main Castle), once notorious for its dungeon. Disgraced princes and other noblemen were confined here, their only solace being the ruined 15th-century chapel adjacent.<n>Leave Játiva on the C-340 and drive up into the highlands where thick-fleeced sheep and isolated farmhouses complete a memorable vista. Pass through Albaida, known for its candle-making, and Onteniente, an industrial town, to picturesque Bocairente. Visit the village during late summer for the festival of folk dancing, or for February’s Fiesta of Moors and Christians. The sombre bull-ring was hacked from solid rock for the Corrida.<n>For a town of barely 5,000 inhabitants, Bocairente’s two small museums are impressive: the Museo Histórico (Historical Museum) is noted for a collection of Stone Age pottery, and the Museo Parroquial (Parish Museum) exhibits important paintings by Juan de Juanes, Ribalta, and Sorolla. In the hills nearby are Iberian cave tombs, referred to locally as the Covetes de Moros (Moorish Caves). Some were later lived in by hardy Christian holy men.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
New Havana<n>The walls surrounding Old Havana were razed during the 19th century to allow the city to expand westward. The long, curvaceous, and crumbling Malecón (breakwater), a six-lane highway alongside the city’s north shore, links the districts of Central Havana and Vedado. The victim of harmful salt spray, the seafront drive is now more a seafront dive. At its eastern end, primary-colored buildings — a showcase of tragic splendor — seem to fall apart before your eyes. Havana’s youth congregate along the Malecón on fine evenings, flying kites, necking, swimming off the rocks, and setting out to sea in giant inner tubes to fish.<n>Although most visitors will want to concentrate on historic and museum-like Old Havana, the newer districts provide a fascinating view of the areas where most people live and work. The most interesting districts of New Havana are Central Havana and Vedado. The former is a congested, lower-middle-class barrio with few attractions for visitors, although a walk along its dusty streets and crumbling façades can be an eye-opening experience. Vedado is the city’s principal commercial and residential zone — the epicenter of middle-class Havana — with parks, monuments, hotels, restaurants, theaters, and the University of Havana. Once the stomping grounds of the elite in the 1950s, the “suburb” of Miramar today is home to the offices of rich foreign companies investing in Cuba and the diplomatic missions of foreign governments.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
Playa Santa Lucía<n>An hour-and-a-half drive (110 km/68 miles) from Camagüey on the north coast, remote Playa Santa Lucía beckons sun worshippers with resort hotels strung along a particularly fine peninsular strip of sand. Each hotel backs directly onto the beach. A superb coral reef lies offshore, and diving here is excellent. Aside from a couple of roadside bars, however, nightlife is limited to hotel entertainment. The only other drawback is the mosquitoes, as voracious as anywhere on the island.<n>To counter the isolation of Playa Santa Lucía, the tourist authorities offer a wide range of excursions, including a rodeo at Rancho King, deep-sea fishing, and boat and helicopter trips for days on the beach at such unspoiled cays as Cayo Sabinal and Cayo Saetía. A bus service visits Playa Los Cocos, some 5 km (3 miles) away; with sheltered aquamarine waters, it’s a strong contender for the title of “Cuba’s most beautiful beach.” Adjacent is La Boca, a very small community of waterside shacks with fish restaurants.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
The ruminative buffalo pulls plows and carts, then wallows in the mud of a village pond. Chickens run in and out of doorways and often may be seen peering out from roosts on the second floor of houses. Under the eaves, bundles of maize hang to dry along with large cucumbers. Pumpkin vines climb over rooftops.<n>Saturday is a good day to visit Dakshinkali (a 45-minute drive from Kathmandu to the southern end of the valley), when thousands of pilgrims bring chickens and goats to sacrifice to Kali. Sacrifices also take place on Tuesday.<n>The shrine is at the bottom of a shady glen by a brook. Carrying their offerings by the feet (incidentally, only male animals may be sacrificed), women form a line on one side and men on the other. The altar where the blood will be spilled is out of sight, behind a wall where a loudspeaker screeches hymns to Kali. Under a bridge, a cauldron bubbles. Decapitated fowl are chucked in to speed the plucking and goats are seared to remove the hair. The offal is thrown into the stream.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
The road north from Kathmandu leads 8 km (5 miles) to Budhanilkantha, and a giant statue of Vishnu reclining on a bed of snakes. Carved from one black stone and set in a sunken tank of water, the 5-m (16-ft) image dates from the seventh century. Legend has it that as Vishnu floated partly submerged in the primeval ocean, a lotus grew out of his navel, issuing Brahma, whose sole task was to create the world. The king cannot visit this shrine, as to look upon what is considered to be an image of himself, an incarnation of Vishnu, would be a forecast of death. On festival days worshippers blanket the statue with flowers. Beyond is Shivapuri Watershed and Wildlife Preserve, good place for a day hike.<n>If there is any one spot outside the cities that is a must, it is Changu Narayan. The oldest temple in the valley and unquestionably one of the most interesting, it sits on an isolated hilltop a few miles north of Bhaktapur and just south of the Sankhu road. The drive from Bhaktapur cuts across paddies and climbs past thickets of bamboo to the ridge top. A misty morning makes the scene even more evocative of the past.<n>The temple is in the center of a walled enclosure, with a treasury of small sculptures and shrines dotted about. One of several masterpieces dedicated to the cult of Vishnu is a broken eighth-century stone panel, a Licchavi work. There is a lovely fifth-century Garuda, and near it, on a memorial pillar, the earliest historical document in Nepal, an inscription of the same period concerning the Licchavi King Manadeva. Doors, niches, struts, and cornices are superbly decorated, yet the temple and compound retain a human dimension and are not overwhelming.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
From Kathmandu, short trips to the valley rim make it possible for those with limited time to see the high mountains at sunrise or sunset.<n>Nagarkot, which stands on the crest of a ridge at 2,195 m (7,200 ft), is about an hour’s drive from Bhaktapur and one of the best places in the Kathmandu area for viewing the Himalayas. From this aerie on the rim of the Kathmandu Valley, 322 km (200 miles) of the Himalayas stretch out before you in an immense wall of rock and ice. Although there are excellent views from the many lodges and hotels here, the view is even better from a nearby observation tower, which can be reached in about an hour’s walk from Nagarkot. From this observation tower, it is possible to see as far as Mount Everest. Most visitors come for the sunrise or sunset on the mountains, and though the weather is often at its clearest in the early morning, low clouds and fog often obstruct the view.<n>The Kathmandu area’s other popular mountain-viewing spot is the village of Dhulikhel, which has a view very similar to that from Nagarkot and is a bit easier to reach, since it is on the main highway to Tibet. This highway passes through Banepa, where you can turn off to visit Panauti. The buildings here have great artistic and historic importance and for this reason have become the focus of a French-funded restoration project. Today, this out-of-the-way village offers a fascinating glimpse into the Kathmandu Valley’s small-town life. Dhulikhel, on the other hand, is strictly about mountain views. Here there are several attractive hotels, including one with tropical gardens, that cater to visitors hoping to catch a glimpse of the Himalayas at sunrise or sunset. At dawn and dusk, the otherwise perfectly spectacular mountains are made just that much more breathtaking as they are painted in shades of lavender and pink by the rising and setting sun.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
Meanwhile oil had been discovered in Louisiana in 1901. The land was transformed by hundreds of small wells sunk to extract the precious liquid. In 1947 the first offshore rig was opened and the Mississippi valley became a hub of oil and gas production and storage. After the Second World War new highways led to broader horizons, and suburbs began to sprawl. Following the construction of the impressive causeway across Lake Pontchartrain in 1956, commuters even began to move to the far side of the lake, and NASA assembled thousands of technicians at suburban Michoud to produce its booster rockets.<n>Desegregation in schools, which hit many southern cities hard in the 1960s, passed off in New Orleans with a minimum of trouble. Whites and blacks had always mixed more freely here than in most places in Dixie, and the drive for racial equality reached an historic high in 1977 when Judge Ernest “Dutch” Morial was elected the first African-American mayor.<n>Today “Dutch’s” son Marc carries on the family tradition as Mayor. But if the city seems to be moving in a positive direction, the state has other problems. As the third millennium begins, Louisiana is again suffering the problem that has plagued it throughout its history. Federal racketeering charges have been brought against Edwin Edwards —  Louisiana State Governor until his retirement in 1996 —  and the huge trial in Baton Rouge is keeping the state on the edge of its seat. It seems that little has changed since the times of John Law.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_NewOrleans-History.txt
The Moors introduced new crops, including oranges and rice, to the region. Their highly distinctive whitewashed houses and filigree chimneys are features of Portugal to this day, as are azulejos (handpainted, glazed ceramic tiles). Many Moorish place names also survive, including that of Fátima, the pre-eminent Catholic site in Portugal. Unlike their successors, the Moors were tolerant of the many different peoples who lived together in Portugal, including Berbers, Arabs, Christians, and Jews.<n>Even so, the Moors were regarded as an occupying power by the local Christian population. The Christian Reconquest, which sought to drive the Muslims out, was under way in the north by the ninth century.<n>It was not until 1128, when Dom Afonso Henríques became the Count of Portucale, that the struggle to regain power met with any real success. Henríques consolidated his position by defeating the Moors at the Battle of Ourique in 1139, and celebrated by naming himself the first king of Portugal.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-History.txt
The topographical highlight of the Arrábida peninsula is undoubtedly the Serra da Arrábida (site of a nature reserve), a mountain chain around 35 km (22 miles) long which protects the coast from the strong north winds and accounts for the Mediterranean vegetation. The tiny little beach spot, Portinho da Arrábida, is popular with Portuguese weekenders.<n>Setúbal, the district capital, is just a 20-minute drive from Lisbon by motorway, longer if you take the picturesque route via Sesimbra and Arrábida. This is olive and citrus country, with cows grazing among the trees. Setúbal is a conglomeration of market town, industrial center, resort, and Portugal’s third largest fishing port.<n>Setúbal’s greatest historical and artistic treasure, the Gothic Igreja de Jesus, was built around 1490 by the great French architect Boytac, who later built Lisbon’s glorious Jerónimos Monastery (see page 36). A dramatic main portal leads into the church, which boasts two inspired elements of decoration: 17th-century azulejos on the walls, and stone pillars like twisted strands of clay, fragile-looking in spite of their obviously solid dimensions.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
Lamego has a wealth of handsome Baroque mansions, as well as a scenic 13th-century castle and a 16th-century Sé (cathedral) with a 12th-century tower. The Museu de Lamego in the old bishop’s palace houses a fine collection of Flemish tapestries and religious statues, as well as paintings by Grão Vasco of the Viseu school (see page 56).<n>Pinhão, upriver from Régua (both the train trip and drive along the river in this stretch are stunning), is an enjoyable little town with deep connections to the port wine trade. The tiny train station displays azulejos depicting the harvest, and many important quintas owned by the biggest port concerns, as well as independently owned vineyards, hug the hills near here. Taylor, one of the major wine players, recently opened an excellent hotel in Pinhão, the appropriately named Vintage House.<n>From Pinhão to Pocinho, the train snakes along the Douro’s switchbacks with stunning views at every turn (2 hours roundtrip). Another good route is north to Tua. If you want to get closer to the wine production, you’ll need to have a car or arrange a tour with one of the quintas or local hotels. Other towns ensconced in the craggy green hills and pretty terraced vineyards are Alijó, São João da Pesqueira, and Sabrosa.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
The charming, sleepy town of Serpa rises neatly above the plains, 30 km (18 miles) east of Beja, on the route to Spain. Beyond the formidable Porta da Beja, a monumental gate in the city wall, small streets wend among bright white houses. Many of the buildings hide small cheese factories, which produce Serpa’s famous ewe’s milk cheese. The town’s castle was partially destroyed by a Spanish attack in 1707, but still affords enjoyable views. The walls continue past a privately owned 17th-century mansion and on to a slender aqueduct, which ends in an ancient well with a working chain-pulley system for drawing water. A small ethnographic museum displays the wares of the agricultural and industrial workers of the area.<n>From Serpa a rewarding drive takes you south toward the eastern Algarve, through a hilly and sparsely populated landscape where shepherds tend their flocks. Along the way is Mértola, an ancient white-washed town founded by the Phoenicians, built up by the Romans, and later seized by the Moors. Perched on a ridge at the junction of the River Guadiana and the smaller Oeiras, the town is protected by Moorish walls and topped by a rather dilapidated castle with a profusion of storks’ nests.<n>Mértola bursts with history: Its church, the Igreja Matriz, betrays a previous incarnation as a mosque with a prayer niche (mihrab), while the town hall (now a museum) is constructed on Roman foundations. The Guadiana River continues as far as the Algarve, forming part of the border with Spain. The road that follows its banks is one of the most beautiful access routes between the Alentejo and the Algarve.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
The Guadiana River, which runs into the Atlantic 3 km (2 miles) east of Monte Gordo, served as a natural frontier for some 2,000 years, forming the boundary between the Roman provinces of Lusitania (Portugal) and Baetica (southern Spain). This geographical context explains the strategic importance of Castro Marim, a fortress town occupied by the Moors for five centuries.<n>A little to the south, the sleepy but quietly dignified town of Vila Real de Santo António (the Royal Town of St. Anthony) is the last of the Algarve’s beach towns before Spain. The town was built from scratch in just five months in 1774, aping the grid layout of Lisbon’s Baixa (lower city). The town square, Praça do Marquês do Pombal, is the tour de force of Vila Real, with black-and-white pavement radiating from an obelisk in the center of the square like rays from the sun. Vila Real de Santo António’s main appeal is the ferry to Ayamonte across the water in Spain. The trip takes just 20 minutes — less time than it would take to drive to and over the new bridge — and the white town of Ayamonte is a fine sight as you approach it from the river. Crossing into Spain, you will need to take your passport.<n>North from Sagres, along the west coast, is the one part of the Algarve that may well escape intensive development, simply because, although the beaches are pleasant and the coastline dramatic, the water is colder and the wind stronger. For those interested in surfing or solitude, this coast may be ideal. Aljezur’s ruined Moorish castle looks over the town, which makes a good base for neighboring beaches, such as the enormous rocky cove at Arrifana and the wider dune beach of Monte Clerigo, both of which also have their own small tourist complexes. Further north, Odeceixe is a pretty village set in a small river valley, which continues down to a wide cliff-backed beach at the estuary.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
The road runs along the coastline and through the Bosque Estatal de Piñones, an area of beautiful sandy beaches and coconut palms that until recently was a pristine environment where sleepy cattle sat under the trees. It is now a popular weekend picnic spot for city families, many of whom leave their litter behind when they depart. This sort of carelessness spoils Piñones (and many other beauty spots on the eastern coastline within easy reach of San Juan); an assemblage of broken bottles, leftover food, litter, and worse is something you can’t fail to notice.<n>Head through Loíza, and on towards Río Grande. Here Route 187 meets Route 3, one of the major arterial roads around Puerto Rico; it’s a very busy highway, so be aware and drive carefully. Take a left and proceed to Route 191; then turn right and head up toward El Yunque (the Anvil), the most famous mountain in Puerto Rico. Normally capped with clouds it catches from the passing sea breezes, and sometimes entirely lost in a blanket of gray storm-clouds, the 3,496-ft (1,088-m) peak stands at the center of the Caribbean National Forest, an area of virgin rain forest preserved since 1876, when the island was still a Spanish colony. Originally a park of 12,300 acres (4,998 hectares), it now covers 28,000 acres (11,330 hectares) and is managed by the US Forestry Department.<n>The whole area is a place of staggering proportions: there are over 200 species of native trees. One specimen is said to be over 2,500 years old; some trees are so wide it takes several people to reach around them; others soar hundreds of feet into the air. The forest gets over 180 inches (41���2 m) of rain each year — that’s some 100 billion gallons (450 billion liters) of water. The animals that live here are also amazing. This is one of the last habitats of the threatened Puerto Rican parrot. The infamous coquí (see page 47)is, of course, heard everywhere. All in all, the park in an impressive sight, with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt

All in all, the park in an impressive sight, with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance.<n>Arriving via Route 191 you’ll come right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park. This facility presents important information about the history of the park, its plant and animal species, and its role in the local ecology. You can then travel on higher into the park, toward the summit. You can’t drive the whole 8 miles (13 km) between the visitors center and the end of the road, but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way, so there’s ample access. Two popular stops are La Coca Falls, on the right after the 5-mile (8-km) point, and the Yokahú Observation Tower, at the 51⁄2-mile (9-km) point. Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes. The most spectacular cascade in the park, La Mina Falls, is just a 30-minute walk from the roadside, via Big Tree Trail.<n>Take a walk on any of the well-marked trails: the atmosphere is humid and the vegetation constantly damp (your best friends will be your insect repellent and your stout shoes), but the landscape is beautiful and fascinating.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Traveling south from Fajardo you have the option of using Route 53 (a new toll road) or continuing on Route 3. Both roads lead past to the town of Humacao, and on toward the south coast. Just south of the Humacao is a left turn for Palmas del Mar, a growing resort area on the southeast coastline. A residential resort community built around wonderful stretches of beach, the resort offers numerous activities, including horseback-riding, fishing, golf (two courses), and a casino.<n>East of the town of Yabucoa you’ll find the start of the Ruta Panoramica. If you don’t have time to follow this entire trail, at least drive along Route 3 south of Yabucoa to the area around the Cendro la Pandura peak. The road climbs via a series of switchback turns, and once at the top you’ll have a clear view of the town lying in the flat plain below. The lifestyle of the people who live high on the hillside is fascinating. Jíbaros (country farmers) carry machetes to the fields, accompanied by their faithful hounds. Chickens scoot under cars as you approach. Around every turn, you’ll marvel at how the houses can be built on such precipitous slopes. The road then leads along the southern coastal plain through several small towns to Playa de Ponce.<n>Ponce<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
North of the town of Aguadilla, traveling out toward the airport and Rafael Hernandez air force base, are a series of fine bathing and surfing beaches. The most famous is Crash Boat Beach, named after a shipwreck that happened just offshore. The beach is always busy, but the most exciting stretch is the northern section, where the fishing boats rest. Most hours of the morning there are ships coming ashore with their meager, but extremely fresh, catch. The boats are brightly colored and carefully tended to ensure that they are always in peak condition — not one is splintered or sun-bleached.<n>Traveling back along the northern coast there is little to draw the eye. Inland however, it’s a different story. South of the busy town of Arecibo are a number of attractions that would make a fine day-trip from San Juan (none is more than a 90-minute drive from the capital).<n>Route 129 from Arecibo leads to one of the most important and mysterious scientific instruments in the world. Arecibo Observatory has the largest single-dish radio telescope in the world; 1,000 ft (305 m) in diameter, it has been silently scanning the universe, making maps of distant solar systems, and listening for messages from other planets since 1960. The Observatory is part of Cornell University’s National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center; it operates 24 hours a day. The center likes to emphasize the serious scientific work it undertakes — such as detecting extremely weak radio pulses from the very corners of the known universe, which take 100 million years to reach the earth. Some visitors are more impressed by the fact that the observatory was used for location shots in the James Bond film Goldeneye and, more recently, in Contact, starring Jodie Foster. A viewing platform allows you to look down on the massive dish, and in the education center, opened in 1997, visitors can undertake simple and safe experiments to learn more about physics and the solar system.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
The whole cave park is a truly awesome sight, with holes 300 ft (91 m) deep and 200 ft (61 m) across, and caves thousands of feet deep, all surrounded by pristine forest. Some say that the fountain of youth is here, in the clean water filtering through the limestone from the surface. You don’t have to believe the legends, but taste the water anyway — it’s very sweet, and it can’t hurt to wish just a little.<n>From the caves it’s a short drive to Lares, the island’s center of coffee production. The sweet brew made from Puerto Rican beans is considered one of the finest in the world, though production is small. Coffee plants, usually interspersed with other crops such as bananas or plantains, can be seen growing on the high hillsides; it is a crop that enjoys good drainage and lots of humidity, which the large banana leaves help to conserve.<n>From Lares take Route 111 to reach the most important Amerindian site on Puerto Rico, the Parque Ceremonial Indígena Caguana (Caguana Indian Ceremonial Park). The park is set in a wide valley surrounded by limestone peaks, one of which is said to represent the supreme god of the Taínos. The several ceremonial ball courts discovered and excavated here suggest the site was one of the Indians’ major centers of worship. The Taínos were still living happily on the island when Columbus arrived in 1493; archaeological finds here date back to 1200 b.c. The ball courts, edged with stones — some with symbols carved on them — are set in fine gardens planted with many native tree species. A small museum displays pottery and other artifacts found at the site.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Traveling south along the Costa Alegre, two spectacular courses offer exclusive play and multiple ocean views. Isla Navidad (Tel. (3) 355-5103) is one of Mexico’s top-rated resort courses, designed by Robert Von Hagge. It features wide-open fairways and big greens, with plenty of water, including eight oceanside holes. The course at El Tamarindo (Tel. (3) 551-5031) may not be as renown as the others, but it is a lush beauty of a course set in a tropical rainforest by the sea. The approaches to the holes wind through jungle paths, and fairways and greens are gently worked into the mountainous terrain bordering the Pacific Ocean.<n>In Manzanillo, golf is an integral part of the Las Hadas resort where La Mantarray golf course (Tel. (3) 334-0000), designed by Roy and Pete Dye, is considered among the most scenic in the world. Compact and challenging, 12 of the 18 holes are played over water, including its signature 18th hole, with a drive to an island green.<n>Further south, Ixtapa has two solid courses: the Robert Trent Jones Jr.–designed Club de Golf Ixtapa Palma Real (Tel. (7) 553-1062), and the more challenging Club de Gold Marina Ixtapa (Tel. (7) 553-1410), designed by Robert Von Hagge.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt
