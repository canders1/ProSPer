OK, well, I started the training in the U2 with the pressure suits and everything and uh, I don't know how long it was I suited and unsuited the pilots and just practiced putting them in the aircraft.<n>Well it got to where there's two or three aircraft arrive in a week and I didn't know where they're flying to.<n>All we done, they never did tell us any place where they was going, even when they left the base to go to somewhere else to stay for a while.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
yeah<n>it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning  um that really it just makes you not feel particularly safe and it's annoying as well<n>um-hum<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3294-ms98-a-trans.txt
well yeah you can't enjoy it right<n>and so i don't like to arrive or or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out so<n>that's that's what i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking in the oven it's  everybody just<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3682-ms98-a-trans.txt
oh well<n>it was difficult to know when the person was going to arrive we're we're fortunate in that my husband works most of the time out of our home so he was here but<n>it would've probably been an inconvenience if if it had been a home pickup and and we hadn't been here but they were also willing to pick up at work<n>	#telephone#	telephone_sw3729-ms98-a-trans.txt
