it's it's a lot better then nothing i think oh yeah i've just recently um something i tried to incorporate into life style just recently is	walk	ing when i'm going short distances like when i'm at work if i'm going to go to a restraint for lunch just choosing one close enough to	#telephone#	telephone_sw4221-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
it's really is part of what i need to do anyway you know i need to get to the bus yeah and it's finite too you know you eventually reach the bus you don't reach your two miles and say well i really should	walk	that extra mile it's find i right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4221-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1

yeah and the other is i'm getting older now so it makes more sense to	walk	than it does to run yeah i can um	#telephone#	telephone_sw4250-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah that too i mean uh the um but the reason why i noticed you were talking about	walk	ing i i don't if i	#telephone#	telephone_sw4250-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah well i	walk	forty five i	#telephone#	telephone_sw4250-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and i had to do all this to play it you know to get things under control yeah yeah no i understand that i mean i i sometimes you know feel like uh well one reason another another reason why i run rather than do something like	walk	is uh it takes a long time yes	#telephone#	telephone_sw4250-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
i'm not i'm i'm not sure about Sears but i know the sporting goods stores and i know Sears used to sell guns i just i'm aggravated with Sears right now yeah yeah you know the stores the stores are here but it's you know you	walk	in and i'd like to look at that okay fine let me see your paperwork uh it's kind of funny because um we are going out to California in a while and uh out there you can	#telephone#	telephone_sw4265-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah yeah you know the stores the stores are here but it's you know you	walk	in and i'd like to look at that okay fine let me see your paperwork uh it's kind of funny because um we are going out to California in a while and uh out there you can	#telephone#	telephone_sw4265-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah i mean i i instead of just being able to	walk	into a store and buy a gun they should have a waiting period yeah i agree completely there should be a waiting period and they should be able to do a background check on you	#telephone#	telephone_sw4296-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
you know in terms of verifying who they are and what they're saying and and uh you know people could uh use that you know or the other option i guess is to i mean why do you even have to do it over the phone why couldn't you just	walk	up to the booth and and uh register right there and then they have with uh everything hooked up by the computer you could say okay you've already voted where do you live yeah	#telephone#	telephone_sw4467-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
um i think the guns that are out there hurting people are held by irresponsible people um i don't believe that there should be that you should be able to	walk	into your local supermarket and buy one i mean any bozo could get one then and then it would be indeed scary no	#telephone#	telephone_sw4488-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and if you try that here in the States i mean you could unload four four pounds of dynamite and uh you'd	walk	because they they're not allowed to ask you they're not allowed to do that right	#telephone#	telephone_sw4501-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah i you know you	walk	into one of those places and you basically start to feel depressed because they don't a lot of places don't have a good atmosphere they're just it's almost like they just shove people in there and wait for them to die	#telephone#	telephone_sw4522-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and they also provide towels and shower facilities and lockers and everything so uh you i've been through the routine i guess like most people where you know i've joined health clubs i've been at the university where you know it's a pretty good distance away you know quarter of a mile	walk	and uh nothing seemed to work for me as well as having it in my own building	#telephone#	telephone_sw4555-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
too old essentially essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but but certainly um certainly have are are are have retained all of their uh mental skills and so on it's must be depressing to to	walk		#telephone#	telephone_sw4619-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and so you yeah you	walk	ed in there and it didn't look like uh you know how you you	#telephone#	telephone_sw4619-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
but this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that and they had all their stuff from their house and it looked like a it it it must have been it was nicer to	walk	in there and to talk to them and it must also give them a sense of uh uh security and and uh and and you know security security uh yeah i i think part of what you're saying matches what i have have read i used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who	#telephone#	telephone_sw4619-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
i'm a big fan of the library i you know i i i don't really reread books so with the price of the paperbacks and even the hardcovers going up i just why not use the library they'll even get anything you ask them to find for you so you know why not do that but i am a big fan of the new book rack you	walk	in uh-huh	#telephone#	telephone_sw4650-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
the ones that they also put mentally ill patients in the same they were not on the same you know ward but they they were in the same nursing home so that these mentally ill patients could	walk	into where the other uh older people that were in there for reasons of uh you know age uh the mentally ill patients could	#telephone#	telephone_sw4655-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
in the same they were not on the same you know ward but they they were in the same nursing home so that these mentally ill patients could	walk	into where the other uh older people that were in there for reasons of uh you know age uh the mentally ill patients could	#telephone#	telephone_sw4655-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
yeah it's it's to bad because it's um i mean the just the even the random occurrences where you know it's unsafe for a woman just to	walk	from their car to the some in certain areas like from from the car from their car to the mall or something and it's dangerous and it's just that's just ridiculous and i know	#telephone#	telephone_sw4752-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
and it's as far as a safety thing in like in San Luis Obispo for example there's an ordinance which states that um there's no smoking in any public areas and so if you	walk	into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere oh really	#telephone#	telephone_sw4840-ms98-a-trans.txt	walk	spoken	OANC_spoken	1
