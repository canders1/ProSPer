The Slater mill not only copied British technology but recreated that country’s arrangement of family labor, which included young children, six-day weeks, the minimum twelve-hour day, Sabbath schools, and payment of wages partly in goods and partly in cash. The form of ownership and management also followed British lines—one partner financed the venture, while the other furnished the technical know-how. For these accomplishments, Samuel Slater has been called “the father of American manufactures.” His story underscores the international role of textiles and apparel, their impetus in national economic development, and their place in conflicts over domestic production and imports—a theme that recurs throughout U.S. history. For example, from the outset of the new nation, President George Washington and his Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton wanted to encourage U.S.-based industry. Indeed, Washington wore a dark brown suit, entirely made in America, for his first inaugural on April 30, 1789.3<n>In this chapter, we will concentrate on the past hundred years, outlining major changes in American retail, apparel, and textiles that occurred before the 1980s. The industrial transformation of this earlier period, which affected far more than these three industries, echoes today’s enormous shifts in supplier relations, manufacturing operations, and human resource practices. The changes now going on have their analog in the last century, when technological innovations of the day like railroads, telegraph, and steam power—developed for purposes far afield of retail, apparel, or textiles—helped transform the mass distri-bution of goods and information.<n>Alfred Chandler described the last industrial transformation in his well-known book The Visible Hand. The use of everything from railroads to an improved postal service, according to Chandler, created enterprises with internal administrative structures that coordinated the flow of goods from many individual producers to many more consumers. This administrative coordination reduced “the number of transactions involved in the flow of goods, increased the speed and regularity of that flow, and so lowered costs and improved the productivity of the American distribution system.”4<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
Gerber’s automatic-cutting equipment holds the knife on a frame that spans the cutting table and moves back and forth along the table. The location of the knife anywhere on the table can be precisely controlled by a computer, allowing it to cut its way along the silhouette of the patterns. Finally, Gerber’s equipment enabled the knife to slice through all the cloth without hitting the top of the vacuum table, supporting the lay of cloth on a brush between the fabric and the inlets to the vacuum table. The stiff bristles of the brush were made of plastic with flat tops, similar in appearance to a flat-headed nail. The flat tops supported the fabric. The plastic bristles were stiff enough to support the fabric layer under the force of vacuum while remaining sufficiently flexible to deflect out of the path of the knife.<n>The most up-to-date versions of automatic-cutting equipment, including the GERBERcutter, are even more effective. Cloth is cut by having the knife oscillate up and down while it moves along the silhouette of the apparel pieces in the marker. The knife support tilts to keep the blade erect when going along curves. Software can prevent lines from being cut twice; it can control the touchy job of cutting the apex of wedge-shaped pieces by approaching the point from both sides of the wedge rather than attempting to cut around the tip. The vacuum tables have also become “smart.” One level of vacuum is maintained over the general lay area; a higher level is arranged under the region being cut to keep the cloth fixed.<n>Yet despite the obvious advantages of computer-controlled cutting, only a minority of the business units in our survey (21 percent) were using this kind of equipment in 1992. Most continued to use manually guided electric knives to do their cutting, including some of the largest business units in the sample. Manufacturers have told us that hand-cutting with skilled cutters is as accurate as computer-cutting. Small factory operations, without sufficient volume to support two shifts of cutting, claim that they cannot justify the capital cost of computer systems.7<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
Even before they begin to talk, children display a readiness to participate in narrative.55 After an adult describes and demonstrates some activity (for example, putting a teddy bear to bed), 1-year-olds who as yet have little language can easily reproduce the main steps in correct sequence with toys.56 When toddlers begin to speak, their main interest is in talking about what people do and the consequences of their behavior. Listen to the two-word utterances that appear between 15 and 24 months of age, and you will ﬁnd many expressions like these: “Tommy hit”; “Get cookie”; “Mommy truck” (meaning “Mommy push the truck”); “Daddy outside”; and “My dolly.”57 At the end of the second year, children begin to label their own and others’ internal states with words, such as “want,” “happy,” “mad,” “think,” and “pretend.”58 These assertions about human action, desire, emotion, and perspective are the stu of which narratives are made.<n>Early on, children are sensitive to yet another feature of narrative. At birth, they are captivated by unusual events, perking up their eyes and ears when something new and dierent happens. In keeping with this innate bias, the ﬁrst narratives children produce focus on making sense of the atypical. “Look, the sun is sleepy, going to bed,” said 2 1/2-year-old David while watching the sun disappear below the horizon at the end of a day at the beach. At the sight of a woman with her leg in a cast, 3-year-old Rachel remarked, “Mommy, that lady got a big cut. The doctor sewed up her leg.” (Rachel’s brother had cut his leg a few days earlier and returned from the doctor with stitches and a bandage.)<n>An early armament of narrative tools enables children to quickly and easily comprehend and contribute to the narratives of expert members of their culture.59 In families in which parents and children spend much time together, the ﬂow of stories recreating personal experiences is abundant.60 Through them, adults help children construct increasingly elaborate images of themselves and teach them culturally accepted ways of organizing and interpreting their experiences. As a byproduct of participation, children gain a rich understanding of their own and others’ mental lives—powerful tools in predicting and explaining human behavior and, therefore, in getting along with others. And in enabling children to practice and perfect narrative skills, adult–child conversation provides crucial preparation for literacy. Let’s take a closer look at these diverse beneﬁts of narrative conversation.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
The importance of family mealtimes is underscored by the fact that the most widely used research instrument for assessing the quality of young children’s home environments asks parents whether the child eats at least one meal a day with a parent.104 Scores on that instrument consistently predict early childhood mental development, no matter what the child’s socioeconomic or ethnic background.105<n>television viewing.  In Chapter 1, I noted that according to current survey ﬁndings, American adults spend over one-third of their free time—about 15 hours per week—watching TV. Estimates for children are even more ominous. Regular TV viewing typically begins between 2 and 3 years of age, consuming about 10.5 hours per week, or nearly 13 percent of the child’s waking hours. It rises steadily over early childhood until it reaches an average of 28 hours per week for school-age children, or about 30 percent of the child’s waking hours.106 When we consider how much the set is on during school holidays and summer vacations, children spend more time watching TV than they do in any other waking activity, including going to school and interacting with family members or peers.<n>These statistics are averages; children dier in their attraction to television. For example, parents who watch a lot of TV tend to have children who do the same. Excessive TV viewing is associated with family and peer diculties, poor school achievement, and serious health concerns—speciﬁcally, overweight and obesity as a result of hours of being sedentary and eating high-fat snacks while viewing.107 Parents with stressful, unhappy lives often escape into television, and their children may do so as well.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
Yet a certain number of children and adolescents, despite exposure to severe family adversity, escape these diculties and adjust well. A common element in the lives of such resilient youngsters, as I noted in Chapter 1, is an unusually warm, positive relationship with at least one parent or a close tie with an adult outside the immediate family.125 What happens within these alternative relationships that shields the young person from problems or restores eective functioning? Although little systematic evidence exists on the precise ingredients of such ties, I recently became familiar with the bond forged between Hannah, a 21-year-old college student, and her Aunt Eva and Uncle Charlie, two of my university colleagues. Hannah’s parents divorced when she was 9 and her older sister Sarah was 15. Hannah related the story of her childhood and the genesis of her relationship with Eva and Charlie, who oered insights as well. What they had to say is enlightening.<n>“I can’t remember much family togetherness when I was a kid,” Hannah remarked. “Our parents couldn’t talk things out with each other, and they rarely talked things out with us. Mom took Sarah and me to Girl Scouts, swimming, piano, and other lessons. We enjoyed the activities and the friends we made, but they couldn’t compensate for what was missing: warm, family time. We almost never sat down to a meal together or went places together; we each went our own way. Our dad started going o on vacations by himself when holidays rolled around, so family get-togethers were rare.<n>“When our parents split up, we moved with our mom from Arkansas to Seattle. Mom worked all week, weekends, and most evenings. She had to get a career going so there’d be money to live on and to send us to college. Sarah hung out with another family in the neighborhood. A couple of times a week, she had dinner and went to church with them. Looking back, I’d say they were her substitute family; she ‘adopted’ them, and they ‘adopted’ her. I was too young to go o on my own that way. When I didn’t have after-school activities, Mom insisted that I come home and do chores and homework. Sometimes I got to go to a friend’s house to play, but many nights I’d open a can of spaghetti and have dinner by myself. I spent hours daydreaming and looking at old pictures of Mom, Dad, Sarah, and me.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt

The year after her college graduation, Sarah married a devout classmate, entering into a culture in which family life was pivotal. Six years later, Hannah started college, but for her the road to maturity was rough. She had diculty concentrating, earned uneven grades, and accumulated so many incompletes in courses that the university prohibited her from reenrolling until she wrapped up her “unﬁnished business.” Frustrated with Hannah’s undirectedness, her mother withdrew ﬁnancial support and insisted that she get a job. Hannah’s full-time waitressing soon became both an obstacle and an excuse for lack of progress in her studies. “I was at sea,” Hannah recalled. “I didn’t have any conﬁdence in myself, and I didn’t think I could do anything. So I started visiting Aunt Eva and Uncle Charlie, who lived three hours away.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
“’Cause they’re tired,” Sophie answered, pushing the two animals closer together.<n>“Oh, yes,” Kevin affirmed. Then, building on Sophie’s theme, he placed a teddy bear on another part of the rug and offered, “I think Ted’s tired, too. I’m going to start a bed over here for some other animals.”<n>Sophie turned toward the teddy bear, lifted his paw, and exclaimed, “She wants a lollipop to hold in her hand!”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
“That’s a lollipop,” agreed Sophie, placing it in the paw of the teddy bear.<n>“Can she suck that while she’s going off to sleep?” asked Kevin. “Do you think that’s what she wants?”<n>“It’s a paciﬁer,” explained Sophie, renaming the object.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
“He wants a lollipop, too!”<n>“Oh, he wants a lollipop as well. What are we going to use for a lollipop for the leprechaun?” asked Kevin.<n>Pressing the teddy bear’s and the leprechaun’s arms together and the lollipop-turned-paciﬁer between them, Sophie readily came up with a solution. “He’s sharing,” she affirmed.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Piaget’s View: Exercising a New Symbolic Capacity<n>Piaget acknowledged the emotional function of play, and he agreed that through pretending, children become familiar with social-role possibilities. But he is best known for stressing the symbolic nature of make-believe. Pretending, Piaget pointed out, is a vital means of mentally representing the world that, along with gestures, language, and drawings, develops rapidly in early childhood. Through it, children practice and strengthen their capacity to represent their experiences.3 For example, when Sophie pretended to put the animals to bed and used a TinkerToy to stand for a lollipop, she represented in her mind what formerly she could experience only directly—by going to bed or sucking a lollipop. Practicing and solidifying modes of representation, Piaget emphasized, make it possible for the child to free thought from the here and now; create larger images of reality that take into account past, present, and future; and transform those images mentally in the service of logical thinking.<n>Nevertheless, Piaget was convinced that by itself, make-believe play does little to advance children’s development. Rather, children merely exercise playfully the symbols they have acquired in other contexts.4 Much like his view of private speech as egocentric and nonsocial, Piaget believed that at ﬁrst pretend play is a solitary activity in which the child uses highly personal symbols that cannot easily be interpreted by others. Sociodramatic play, involving joint make-believe with a partner, Piaget claimed, is not under way until age 3. As with other aspects of Piaget’s theory, the direction of development for make-believe is from purely individual, egocentric symbols to social play and shared understanding.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Language and Literacy<n>As the ﬁndings just mentioned illustrate, make-believe greatly enriches children’s facility with language. During sociodramatic activities, preschoolers hear speech that describes and comments on actions going on at the moment. This helps ensure that language is understandable because it is in tune with ongoing events. Consequently, when new words arise in the course of a fantasy scene, children can determine their meaning easily from cues in the situation. In this way, vocabulary extends during make-believe as children introduce words they have heard during recent experiences. For example, “I’m going out. I need my cloak,” said 5-year-old Lizzy, mimicking an expression she had heard in a TV movie while grabbing a dress-up raincoat from a hook in the housekeeping area at child care.<n>“You mean your coat?” asked Lizzie’s playmate.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
One evening, Traci, her two older sisters, and her parents had gathered in the living room to watch a video of The Sound of Music. Although Traci showed little interest in the movie, her ears perked up at a statement in the sound track reporting the death of the mother of the Trapp-family children. Traci began to ask questions, to talk about how the mother must have gotten sick and gone to the hospital, and to repeat that the mother had died. For the next hour and a half, she assigned her own mother and herself at least ﬁfteen different roles—mother, father, baby, sister, doctor, nurse, and more—as she explored the idea of a mother dying:<n>Traci: “Here, you’re the baby and I’m the mama. Honey, I’m going to the hospital.”<n>Mother: “Go to the hospital and have the doctor help you feel better.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Mother: “Go to the hospital and have the doctor help you feel better.”<n>Traci: “No, I’m not going to feel better. I’m going to die!”<n>Mother: (frantically) “No, no, I don’t want you to die! I’ll be very, very sad.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
“Five, six, two, four one, blastoff!” responds Vance, commander of the control tower.<n>Lynette makes one of the dolls push a pretend button and reports, “Brrrm, brrrm, they’re going up!”<n>Among children who have regular contact with peers, sociodramatic play with agemates increases greatly between ages 3 and 5.71 As this excerpt reveals, by age 4 children can create and coordinate several characters in an elaborate plot and weave together intricate role relationships and story lines—factors that, as we have seen, contribute greatly to their cognitive and social competence.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
In Chapter 2, I also noted that it is crucial for parents to model good viewing practices; to watch TV with children, helping them understand and evaluate what they see; and to use televised content as inspiration for make-believe play and other enriching activities. Another suggestion: Try not to use television to reward or punish children. This increases its attractiveness, making children want to watch all the more.<n>My 20-month-old daughter and husband enjoy going to the Public Broadcasting System website. I’m delighted that they spend time together, but the whole computer concept makes me nervous. Already, my daughter bangs on the keys and uses the mouse. How much is too much and how young is too young?<n>More than half of American families own a personal computer, and one-third of these have access to the Internet—rates that are growing rapidly.6 It’s not surprising that even very young children are attracted to the computer—often more so than to television. As one school-age child commented, “It’s fun because you can control it. TV controls itself.”7 Your key-banging, mouse-clicking 20-month-old already seems to appreciate this sense of electronic control!<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
Children’s rooms and play spaces need not be ﬁlled with every toy imaginable. A modest number of toys is sufficient. Children who have too much typically care little for what they have. When given a chance to acquire something new, they usually don’t react with much excitement or selectivity. For materially indulged children, new toys are such a common event that a complacent attitude sets in. The child comes to think, if I don’t like what I just got, I can always discard it for something else. A bedroom or playroom heaped high with a jumble of toys, many broken and mistreated, also teaches children that possessions need not be cared for and respected.<n>Parents often assume that the play materials children choose are the ones that are best for their development. To some degree, this assumption makes sense: If a toy isn’t appealing to the child, the child isn’t going to spend time with it. So it’s important to provide children with a variety of play materials responsive to their interests.<n>Nevertheless, preference is not the same as appropriateness. Children sometimes choose toys with very limited play possibilities and soon ignore them. Other toys should not be given to children because they encourage undesirable play behaviors. Guns and other forms of weaponry fall into this category. In Chapter 4, I pointed to research demonstrating that these aggressive play materials promote both make-believe and real hostility in children’s interactions with peers.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
It’s also important to ﬁgure out why these persistent tantrums are occurring. As the often-heard phrase “terrible twos” suggests, many people assume that tantrums are a fact of life for 2- and even 3-year-olds. Once toddlers acquire the ability to follow adult directives, one way they assert their autonomy is by resisting parents’ requests and demands, using the familiar refrain, “No!” And from time to time, toddlers lose control. When frustrated, they haven’t yet developed many techniques for regulating their emotions. But parents who take mental notes for a day on the number of compliant acts versus the number of tantrums are likely to gain a new appreciation for how infrequent their child’’s tantrums really are. For most young children, eager, willing cooperation is much more common than opposition.26<n>If your child has been emotionally reactive and difficult to soothe since infancy, then temperament is probably a signiﬁcant contributor to his behavior. You’ll also want to consider whether any changes in your family or the child’s daily life might be sparking intense anxiety—marital conﬂict, divorce or remarriage, a new baby brother or sister, starting preschool or child care, or a parent going to work when the child is used to having him or her at home. Parenting practices can modify children’s temperaments and assist them in coping with stressful life events. Protection from family discord; extra parental warmth, affection, and pleasurable time together when the child is behaving well; and ﬁrm, calm, and consistent discipline will help.<n>Most children build up to a tantrum gradually. Parents can tell it’s in the offing, and sometimes they can distract the child before it reaches a peak. For example, if the child is about to “blow” while you’re out shopping, try involving the child in the shopping experience—pointing out things of interest to the child; asking the child to help you select and carry purchases; and reminding the child that after the shopping is ﬁnished, you are going to do something the child enjoys. When parents interrupt a tantrum on the rise by redirecting the child’s attention, they provide strategies children can use on their own to regulate emotion. If parents always wait to intervene after the child has become intensely distressed, it’s harder not only for the parent to calm the child but for the child to learn to calm down. And once the child regains emotional control, reassuring the child of parental love with hugs and comforting words restores the parent–child relationship and strengthens the child’s sense of security.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt

Parent and child can take turns acting out the “parent” and “child” roles. While playing the “child,” the parent can get upset. Then parent and child can come up with ways to help the “child” control intense feelings. Occasionally during make-believe, children send parents clear messages about disciplinary tactics they want and need to quell tantrums. In one instance, Sonja, a mother at wit’s end over her 4-year-old daughter Meredith’s frequent ﬁts of kicking and screaming, consulted a child psychologist. The psychologist had Meredith play the “mother” and Sonja play the “child.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
As the tale is often narrated, a disobedient young girl goes to the dance without her parents’ permission, or she goes against her mother’s express wishes. While at the dance a handsome beautifully dressed man asks her to dance. They dance all night, until she suddenly notices with a shock that he isn’t wearing shoes, and in fact he doesn’t even have feet; instead he has chicken feet, goat’s hooves, or a pig’s foot and a chicken foot. It is usually at this point, after he’s discovered, that he disappears into thin air, leaving the odor of sulfur in the air, or, in some versions of the legend, just runs out the door. The girl he was dancing with either faints or burns to death as she goes up in smoke. If the girl doesn’t die, as in some stories, she might suffer a burn on the shoulder or a man’s handprint might be found on her back. A small circle of people who are present at the dance observe this encounter, and the narrator of the story usually says that she or he heard it from someone who was there.<n>The lesson learned is that one must not disobey one’s parents, for the handsome man is known to be the devil and the personification of evil. It is noted that mostly women narrate these legends, among themselves or from mothers to daughters, in a didactic fashion, to instill fear in young women so that they will not disregard parental authority. In some variants a young girl specifically transgresses religious beliefs by insisting on going to a dance on Good Friday, a religious holy day, and a revered day of prayer in Chicano Catholic households. The appearance of the devil on this day is an especially ominous sign.<n>Robe’s collection of New Mexico legends contains thirty-four variants of the devil-at-the-dance tale. Although the legends in this collection are from rural northern New Mexico, collected in the 1950s and 1960s, we find contemporary versions of the devil-at-the-dance tales in south Texas and in Baja California from the 1980s. Limón and Herrera-Sobek discuss versions of the tale circulating in nightclubs and discotheques among urbanized young people.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
Tacos made from corn tortillas are much older; they have been around since the epoch of the Aztecs. Wheat and flour were introduced into New Spain by the Spaniards, and one can see that the flour tortilla is similar to the flat bread found in many Mediterranean countries. Once flour tortillas were discovered, the move to making tacos from flour tortillas was logical. Since corn tortillas are small, and can only bend or fold over once, and flour tortillas are more pliable and can be rolled several times, the flour taco was a natural outcome. A burrito can be made with any type of filling, such as beans, potatoes, chile con carne, chile colorado, carnitas (chile with meat, red chile, roasted pork meat), or even peanut butter.<n>Flour tortillas and burritos are found in northern Mexico and the Southwest, but are not known in other parts of Mexico. Since at least the 1920s, Chicanos from Texas have been making what came to be called burritos. Originally they were called tacos; another story about the origin of the name is that in the 1940s there was an establishment in Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, called Los Burritos that sold tacos made of tortillas de harina (flour tortillas). It became a well-known place to go, and people spoke of going a los burritos (to the burritos) when they wanted tacos of that kind. Commercial burritos became available in San Francisco in 1961, according to an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, and now there are supposedly over 150 burrito taquerías (taco restaurants) in the Mission District of that city. Burros is the name reserved for the very large tortilla burritos, in which the tortilla may be a foot and a half to two feet in diameter.<n>See also Tacos<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
In parts of the Southwest, children were disciplined by parents who narrated scary stories of The Black Hand. If they didn’t behave or do as they were told, La Mano Negra would take them away. In the Ernest Baughman Collection at the University of New Mexico Library, an informant narrates being told by her grandfather in Tesuque, New Mexico, about La Mano Negra. A young woman remembers, “My grandfather used to tell us when we were little, about La Mano Negra, that appeared every time little kids were bad and that if we weren’t good and helped him carry in wood and water and feed the animals ‘la mano negra’ would come for us at night. It would get really big, take us from our beds and never bring us back home” (November 1974). Members of the academic electronic listserv CHICLE have held discussions and reminisced about La Mano Negra. One member remembered it by the name of La Mano Pachona without knowing its origin, but the fear of it was well remembered by all.<n>Marc Simmons writes about a legend of La Mano Negra from the town of Bernalillo, New Mexico. An old priest dies, but the villagers believe he was unable to complete all his work because his spirit frequently returns. When the bell of the church is heard ringing late at night, the local Indians come to listen, and they see the spirit of the priest going into the church and praying. They call the Hispanos to come and see, and when the priest is seen in the church one of the observers cries out. At this point the priest places his hand on the missal and vanishes. “Burned through several pages was the scorched imprint of the padre’s hand, La Mano Negro.” Simmons states that he recalls a similar legend from Ireland (2).<n>References CHICLE 1995; Ernest Baughman Collection; Simmons 1989<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
Nacimiento (Nativity Scene)<n>From the Spanish word nacer, nacimiento is the name for a Christmas nativity scene. In the Southwest the creation of nacimientos has been a tradition since the seventeenth century. A nacimiento may resemble a religious altar in that it is an assemblage of many articles and objects, all depicting the recent birth of Jesus Christ in the manger, but a nacimiento can also include other Christmas-related images, biblical scenes, and possibly artifacts relating to the life experiences of the creator. The set of the nacimiento can vary in size from a small table to half a room, or to the whole front yard of a home. Outdoor nacimientos will have life-size figures of Mary and Joseph and various other biblical characters and animals. This custom is not particular to the Chicano community, and nativity scenes can be found throughout the country during the Christmas season. It is thought that Saint Francis of Assisi is the saint responsible for much of the veneration of the infant Jesus, and the custom of creating nativity scenes or monuments to the birth of Christ has been going on for hundreds of years.<n>In private homes nacimientos are usually set up for the first night of Las Posadas, which starts on December 16 and continues until December 24. A nacimiento is left in place until El Día de los Reyes, Epiphany, on January 6, when the three kings arrive to visit the Christ child.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chN.txt

Also, elections for the presidency begin to take on the quality of a national referendum in place of a compilation of preferences by the individual states. People started voting and expressing themselves as the voice of the nation. Thus, it came to be obvious that citizens of the country who did not reside in the states (namely, those in the federal district) must also have the right to vote for national offices. The Constitution nominally retained the electoral college as a way of giving lip service to the states, but it is clear that the popular vote expresses the will of the nation. This became clear in the presidential election of 2000, discussed in detail in the Afterword. On the basis of the results certified on November 26, Governor George W. Bush acquired a one vote majority in the electoral college. Vice President Gore’s persistent legal challenge to the certified result depended, in part, on the sense of legitimacy he acquired from winning the confidence of the nation in the popular vote.<n>The remaining constitutional amendments fine-tune the workings of Congress and the presidency. The Twentieth shortens the lameduck period between the November election and the change of leadership in the following year. Previously the inauguration was prescribed for the beginning of March, but the amendment moved up the date to January 3 for Congress and January 20 for the presidency. Although this amendment appears simply to address matters of the calendar, it came into play recently in the dispute about whether an outgoing lameduck House of Representatives could, in the period between election and going out of office, constitutionally impeach President Clinton. Bruce Ackerman shocked the Capital by testifying before the House that the newly seated Senate could not constitutionally try the president on an impeachment passed by the outgoing House.8 The amendment also authorizes Congress to prescribe a mode of succession to the presidency between elections.<n>The Twenty-Second Amendment (1951) limits the term of office of the president to two four-year terms plus a maximum of two years inherited from a predecessor unable to complete his term. And the Twenty-Fifth (1967) regulates in detail the problem of transition when the president is still alive but incapable of executing the office. The last amendment, the Twenty-Seventh, prohibits congressionally legislated pay raises from taking effect until another national election has taken place, and a new Congress is sworn in. This last revision of the national charter also testifies to the theme of improving the workings of popular democracy: the people must be consulted before their elected representatives should be allowed to raise their own salaries. The curious twist in this last addition to the Constitution is that although it was finally ratified by three-fourths of the states in 1993, it was originally proposed by James Madison two hundred years earlier. Its formal roots lie in the original Constitution of 1787.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
So far as it goes, the proposed amendment makes sense. It expresses the spirit of compassion rooted in the Secret Constitution. It expresses the same sentiments that led to other initiatives to protect the weak and defenseless. Although each of the constitutional efforts to intervene on behalf of the powerless has a different impulse and a different agenda, they all spring from a root concern for those who are not strong enough to act for themselves. This is the common thread that begins in the Thirteenth Amendment, peaks, perhaps wrongly, in Prohibition, and issues today into the movement “to stand by victims, to restore their dignity, to find a way for them to think of themselves, once again, as men and women equal to all others.”<n>The opposition to victims’ rights stems from both prosecutors and defense counsel. The former do not want victims complicating the trial. They are surely opposed to my proposal that victims be able to veto plea bargains and insist on going to trial to vindicate their charges.11 Prosecutors generally like to have victims around at the sentencing phase. The suffering and rage of the victims, when expressed in court, tends to spike the punishment. Defense counsel are opposed for other reasons. They are afraid that empowering victims will distract from the rights of criminal defendants, but this is not necessarily the case.12 The victim’s interest is primarily in participating in the trial. He or she may communicate a desire for conviction but that parochial sentiment of interest will be readily discounted by the commonsense responses of the jury. The fact is that it is possible to strengthen the participatory rights of victims without unduly complicating the procedure or compromising the traditional rights of the defense.<n>Civil Society<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
But civil society is not always to be trusted. Witness the drive toward a constitutional amendment to protect the flag against physical desecration. The amendment actually passed the House of Representatives in the summer of 1999, but it is not expected to command the necessary two-thirds vote in the Senate. When speech induces a sense of victimization in minorities and women, many academics in the United States and even more lawmakers abroad reach for the arsenal of legal remedies to show their compassion for victims. Two basic strategies present themselves. One technique trades heavily on the values of the Secret Constitution and the other, characteristic of German thought, relies heavily on the Kantian concept of human dignity. The general principle of equal treatment, as we have elaborated it, lends itself to the argument for limiting freedom of speech. The claim is that obscenity degrades women and, thus, fails to treat them equally with the men who are interested in consuming the obscene material. Similarly, hate speech systematically degrades its targets and, therefore, treats them as unworthy of equal status in society. These are good arguments that draw on a long tradition of concern in the theory of equality for protecting the weak and defenseless.<n>The alternative mode of compassionate jurisprudence relies on the concept of human dignity, elaborated in Article 1 of the German Basic Law of 1949. The term “human dignity” is not defined in the Basic Law and, therefore, the courts must rely on the basic Kantian principles that human dignity expresses the ultimate personhood of each individual. In my view, although we have never expressed a principle of human dignity in American constitutional law, the same principle underlies our commitment to the Great Maxim. Our notion of equality-in-creation derives from the view that we are all of ultimate value, an idea that can be expressed either by going back to the biblical idea of creation in the image of God or taking the secular alternative of human dignity beyond all price, as articulated in Kant’s moral theory.24<n>To see how the notion of human dignity operates in practice, let us take a look at the well-known Peep Show case decided in 1981 by the Federal Administrative Court [Bundesverwaltungsgericht] in Germany.25 The operators of a peep show were denied a business permit because their show supposedly violated the morals of the community. Their show displayed a naked woman on a circulating round stage, viewed by men in private booths equipped with one-way windows. The women could not see the men who were gawking at their genitalia and the men could not see each other. The Federal Administrative Court upheld the denial of the license on the ground that the show violated the “human dignity” of the women who chose to participate. That participation was voluntary was irrelevant, for the state had an absolute duty under Article 1 to “protect human dignity” whether the victims wanted the help or not.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
Two years later, in September of 1996, I published a modestly well-organized version of Investigations as a Santa Fe Institute preprint, launched it onto the web, and put it aside for the time being. I found I had indeed been led into arenas that I had in no way expected, led by a swirl of ever new questions. I put the notebooks aside, but a year later I returned to the swirl, taking up again a struggle to see something that, I think, is right in front of us = always the hardest thing to see. This book is the fruit of these eVorts. And this first chapter is but an introduction, in brief, to the themes that will be explained more fully in the following chapters. I would ask the reader to be patient with unfamiliar terms and concepts.<n>My first eVorts had begun with twin questions. First, in addition to the known laws of thermodynamics, could there possibly be a fourth law of thermodynamics for open thermodynamic systems, some law that governs biospheres anywhere in the cosmos or the cosmos itself? Second, living entities = bacteria, plants, and animals = manipulate the world on their own behalf: the bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient that is easily said to be going to get “dinner”; the paramecium, cilia beating like a Roman warship’s oars, hot after the bacterium; we humans earning our livings. Call the bacterium, paramecium, and us humans “autonomous agents,” able to act on our own behalf in an environment.<n>My second and core question became, What must a physical system be to be an autonomous agent? Make no mistake, we autonomous agents mutually construct our biosphere, even as we coevolve in it. Why and how this is so is a central subject of all that follows.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
Then too there is the mystery of the emergence of novel functionalities in evolution where none existed before: hearing, sight, flight, language. Whence this novelty? I was led to doubt that we could prestate the novelty. I came to doubt that we could finitely prestate all possible adaptations that might arise in a biosphere. In turn, I was led to doubt that we can prestate the “configuration space” of a biosphere.<n>But how strange a conclusion. In statistical mechanics, with its famous liter box of gas as an isolated thermodynamic system, we can prestate the configuration space of all possible positions and momenta of the gas particles in the box. Then Ludwig Boltzmann and Willard Gibbs taught us how to calculate macroscopic properties such as pressure and temperature as equilibrium averages over the configuration space. State the laws and the initial and boundary conditions, then calculate; Newton taught us how to do science this way. What if we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and calculate with Newton’s “method of fluxions,” the calculus, from initial and boundary conditions and laws? Whether we can calculate or not does not slow down the persistent evolution of novelty in the biosphere. But a biosphere is just another physical system. So what in the world is going on? Literally, what in the world is going on?<n>We have much to investigate. At the end, I think we will know more than at the outset. But Investigations is at best a mere beginning.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
Quite to my astonishment, the story that will unfold here suggests a novel answer to the question, What is life? I had not expected even the outlines of an answer, and I am astonished because I have been led in such unexpected directions. One direction suggests that an answer to this question may demand a fundamental alteration in how we have done science since Newton. Life is doing something far richer than we may have dreamed, literally something incalculable. What is the place of law if, as hinted above, the variables and configuration space cannot be prespecified for a biosphere, or perhaps a universe? Yet, I think, there are laws. And if these musings be true, we must rethink science itself.<n>Perhaps I can point again at the outset to the central question of an autonomous agent. Consider a bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient, its flagellar motor rotating. If we naively ask, “What is it doing?” we unhesitatingly answer something like, “It’s going to get dinner.” That is, without attributing consciousness or conscious purpose, we view the bacterium as acting on its own behalf in an environment. The bacterium is swimming upstream in order to obtain the glucose it needs. Presumably we have in mind something like the Darwinian criteria to unpack the phrase, “on its own behalf.” Bacteria that do obtain glucose or its equivalent may survive with higher probability than those incapable of the flagellar motor trick, hence, be selected by natural selection.<n>An autonomous agent is a physical system, such as a bacterium, that can act on its own behalf in an environment. All free-living cells and organisms are clearly autonomous agents. The quite familiar, utterly astonishing feature of autonomous agents = E. coli, paramecia, yeast cells, algae, sponges, flat worms, annelids, all of us = is that we do, everyday, manipulate the universe around us. We swim, scramble, twist, build, hide, snuZe, pounce.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
The equation F = MA is a definitional circle, according to Poincaré. Many physicists disagree with Poincaré. I tend to agree, but then I am not a physicist, so take care.<n>On the other hand, the great twentieth-century philosopher Ludwig Witt-gen-stein said something similar in his majestic Philosophical Investigations. Witt-genstein came to his revolutionary investigations painfully, ultimately rejecting his own earlier triumph in the Tractatus. Indeed, part of why I have so blatantly borrowed Wittgenstein’s title, without my presumption to similar intellectual stature, is that there is a parallel between Wittgenstein’s abandonment of the Tractatus and growing awareness of knowing as living a language game, and a central theme of this Investigations, that there may be a limit to the way Newton taught us to do science and a need to reformulate what we do when we and other agents get on with living a life. As we will see, in both cases, it appears that something profound is going on in the universe that is not finitely prestatable. Life and language games seem persistently open to radical innovations that cannot be deduced from previous categories and concepts. I will only be able to discuss these issues more fully after we have encountered autonomous agents and their unfolding mysteries.<n>In his early Tractatus, Wittgenstein had brought to conclusion the mandate of logical atomism from Russell. Logical atomism sought a firm epistemological foundation for all knowledge in terms of privileged “atomic statements” about “sense data.” The idea, flowing from Hume to Berkeley to Kant then back to British empiricism, was the following: One might be mistaken in saying that a chair is in the room, but one could hardly be mistaken in reporting bits and pieces of one’s own awareness. For example, “I am having the experience of a brown color”; “I am aware of the note A-flat.” These statements were thought to record sense data and to be less susceptible to error than statements about the “external world” of chairs, rocks, and legal systems. Logical atomism sought to reconstruct statements about the external world from logical combinations of atomic statements about sense data. The Tractatus sought to bring that program to fruition   .   .   .    and nearly succeeded.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
There is no finitely prespecifiable list of statements about ordinary human actions whose truth would be necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement that the jury found Henderson guilty of murder.<n>Another example concerns the United Kingdom going to war with Germany. There is no finitely prespecifiable set of ways this must happen. Thus, the queen, one day after tea, might betake herself to Parliament and cry, “We are at war with Germany!” Or the prime minister might in Parliament say, “Members, by the authority of my oYce I declare that we are at war with Germany!” Or ten thousand irate football fans from Leeds might shoulder picks, take to barges, funnel in fury up the Rhine, and attack football fans in Koblenz. Or   .   .   .   . In short, there is no prestatable set of necessary and suYcient conditions about the actions of individual humans for the United Kingdom to manage to go to war with Germany. (And may neither nation again find a way to make war on the other in the future.)<n>Wittgenstein’s point is that one cannot, in general, reduce statements at a higher level to a finitely specified set of necessary and suYcient statements at a lower level. Instead, the concepts at the higher level are codefined. We understand “guilty of murder” within the legal language game and thus in terms of a codefining cluster of concepts concerning the features noted above = law, legal responsibility, evidence, trial, jury.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
You initiate the second part of the power stroke by pushing on the handle and moving the cylinder out of contact with the hot T1 reservoir to a position between the two heat reservoirs, touching neither. You immediately let go of the handle. The working gas continues to expand, pushing downward on the piston and moving it away from the head of the cylinder. However, because the cylinder is out of contact with T1 and the working gas is expanding, the working gas gets noticeably cooler, so pressure drops appreciably while volume increases slightly. This part of the power stroke is called “adiabatic expansion.” In Figure 3.2, the adiabatic expansion step carries the system from step 2 to step 3, the end of the power stroke, a point where the pressure is at the lowest point, and the volume of the working gas is at the highest point of the work cycle.<n>Now in order to return the Carnot engine to its initial state, 1 (in Figure 3.2), such that the working gas can again expand and do mechanical work on the piston, work must be done on the engine to bring the piston back up to its position near the head of the cylinder and to recompress and reheat the working gas so that its temperature and pressure values, or state, correspond to state 1. If the work done on the Carnot engine simply retraced the exact pathway from step 3 to step 2 to step 1, at least as much work would have to be done on the Carnot engine as the engine released in the power stroke in going from 1 to 2 to 3. If so, no net work would be carried out by the Carnot engine on the external world.<n>Instead of retracing the power stroke pathway, the Carnot engine, and all heat engines, use a simple trick. You will do it. At step 3, the end of the power stroke, you push on the handle, pushing the cylinder into contact with the low-temperature reservoir, T2. Indeed, you have arranged things such that at the end of the power stroke the working gas is itself at this lower temperature, T2.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
A cell is a parallel-processing dynamical system. That is to say, the cell carries out a wide variety of molecular activities, including the turning on and o of transcription of genes into RNA; the processing of that RNA into mature messenger RNA; the translation of that RNA into proteins, the activities of many of those proteins as enzymes to catalyze reaction, the modification of the activities of enzymes by chemical events such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation; the building of structural components such as bilipid membrane, and microtubule assembly and disassembly; and the construction of proteins and other receptors. These receptors are located transmembrane at the cell boundary and elsewhere in the cell, including on nuclear membranes of eukaryotes, such that signal molecules can be detected and responded to.<n>So, lots of activities are going on all the time, in parallel, in your typical E. coli, yeast, or your own pancreatic cells. The proper conceptual framework to think about all this activity is the “state space” of the system. If we ignore geometry, that is, the locations of molecules relative to one another in the cell  which is a big idealization  then the state space of a cell consists of a list of all the molecular species and their “activities” or “concentrations.”<n>In the following, I will focus on the behavior of the genetic regulatory network. It has been known since the seminal work of Jacob and Monod in and , work for which they won the Nobel Prize, that genes can turn one another on and o. In more detail, the protein made by one gene can diuse in the cell and bind to a DNA site, called a “cis acting site,” near a second gene. Genes that encode proteins are the structural genes; the binding of the protein, or several proteins at a set of nearby cis sites, can turn the second structural gene on or o. More generally, the binding of diusible factors, called “trans acting factors,” to cis sites, can tune graded rates of transcription of the nearby structural gene.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
It all began at the Santa Fe Institute several years ago. Steve Harris, a molecular biologist from Texas was visiting. I told him about canalyzing functions. “Never,” said Steve. Seeing my opportunity I replied, “You have a good genetics library, want to read a bunch of papers and analyze the transcription rules of genes with three or four or five known regulatory inputs?”<n>I didn’t think Steve would say yes, for the reading of over a hundred papers in the subsequent years, and cataloging the detailed results, was going to be a substantial task.<n>“Sure,” he replied.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
Dandy, the mock community was stable. They kept adding randomly chosen species. At first, it was easy to add new species, but it became progressively harder until no more species could be added. The deep mystery is, why? It is not a lack of food or energy. Furthermore, on the way to assembling the community, Stuart and Mack began to notice that as the community filled up, addition of one species could make one or more other species go locally extinct. They began to find evidence of power law distributions of such extinction events.<n>Why? No one knows for sure, and Stuart has some wonderful ideas discussed in his fine book, The Balance of Nature. But I am going to move on to the recent ideas of Bruce Sawhill and Tim Keitt, which build on the work of physicist Scott Kirkpatrick. Scott is famous for coinventing the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model and hangs out at IBM being smart. Not long ago, he took up what is called the “Ksat” problem.<n>Here is the Ksat problem. Consider some logical formula, or expression, as in our Boolean net. Any Boolean expression can be cast in “normal disjunctive form”; an example is (A or A) and (A or A) and (not A or not A). In such an expression the variables between brackets constitute a “clause,” so this logical expression has three clauses. The clauses are linked by “and.” Thus, for the entire statement to be true, all three clauses must be true. Within each clause, variables are linked by the logical “or,” symbolized with v. (A v A) is true if A is true, if A is true, or if both A and A are true.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
Thus, this model shows an invisible hand in which natural selection, acting on individuals only, tunes landscape ruggedness. All players are, on average, fitter in the sense of surviving as species for much longer periods, yet the ecosystem appears self-organized critical with a power law distribution of extinction events. Species lifetime distributions are also power laws.<n>Does this model apply to the real world? There is now considerable evidence that over the past million years the size distribution of extinction events in the record, in terms of the number of species going extinct per -million-year period, is best understood as a power law, with many small and few large extinction events, (Figure .). Furthermore, the lifetime distribution of species, as well as genera and families, is, indeed, a power law (Figure .a,b).<n>I have discussed my own model primarily to focus on the fact that coevolution by self-natural selection alone acting on individuals alone can tune landscape ruggedness so those landscapes are self-consistently well searched by the creatures searching them and their search mechanisms. We can, and presumably do, self-consistently coconstruct ourselves, our niches (and hence problem spaces), and our search mechanisms such that, on average, we propagate ourselves and our descendants. It has worked for . billion years. Were our fitness landscapes such that we could not search them, we would not be here. We coconstruct our ways of making a living and search out better ways of making a living while we jiggle one another.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
Actually, there has been a major extension of general competitive equilibrium called “rational expectations.” Like general competitive equilibrium, this theory too is beautiful but, I think, deeply flawed.<n>Rational expectations grew, in part, out of an attempt to understand actual trading on stock exchanges. Under general competitive equilibrium, little trading should occur and stock prices should hover in the vicinity of their fundamental value, typically understood as the discounted present value of the future revenue stream from the stock. But, in fact, abundant trading does occur, and speculative bubbles and crashes occur. Rational expectations theory is built up around another fixed-point theorem. Rational expectations theory assumes a set of economic agents with beliefs about how the economy is working. The agents base their economic actions on those beliefs. A fixed point can exist under which the actions of the agents, given their beliefs about the economy, exactly create the expected economic behavior. So, under rational expectations one can understand bubbles. It is rational to believe that prices are going above fundamental value and thus to invest, and the investments sustain the bubble for a period of time.<n>Meanwhile, Homo economicus has been thought to be infinitely rational. In the Arrow-Debreu setting, such infinitely rational agents bargain and achieve the best equilibrium price for each dated contingent good. In rational expectations, the agents figure out how the economy is working and behave in such a way that the expected economic system is the one that arises. The theories and actions of the agents self-consistently create an economy fitting the theories under which the agents operate.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt

At 8:59, Flight 175 passenger Brian David Sweeney tried to call his wife, Julie. He left a message on their home answering machine that the plane had been hijacked.

No one at the FAA or the airlines that day had ever dealt with multiple hijackings. Such a plot had not been carried out anywhere in the world in more than 30 years, and never in the United States. As news of the hijackings filtered through the FAA and the airlines, it does not seem to have occurred to their leadership that they needed to alert other aircraft in the air that they too might be at risk.<n>United 175 was hijacked between 8:42 and 8:46, and awareness of that hijacking began to spread after 8:51. American 77 was hijacked between 8:51 and 8:54. By 9:00, FAA and airline officials began to comprehend that attackers were going after multiple aircraft. American Airlines' nationwide ground stop between 9:05 and 9:10 was followed by a United Airlines ground stop. FAA controllers at Boston Center, which had tracked the first two hijackings, requested at 9:07 that Herndon Command Center "get messages to airborne aircraft to increase security for the cockpit." There is no evidence that Herndon took such action. Boston Center immediately began speculating about other aircraft that might be in danger, leading them to worry about a transcontinental flight-Delta 1989-that in fact was not hijacked. At 9:19, the FAA's New England regional office called Herndon and asked that Cleveland Center advise Delta 1989 to use extra cockpit security.<n>Several FAA air traffic control officials told us it was the air carriers' responsibility to notify their planes of security problems. One senior FAA air traffic control manager said that it was simply not the FAA's place to order the airlines what to tell their pilots.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
Many controllers work at the FAA's 22 Air Route Traffic Control Centers. They are grouped under regional offices and coordinate closely with the national Air Traffic Control System Command Center, located in Herndon, Virginia, which oversees daily traffic flow within the entire airspace system. FAA headquarters is ultimately responsible for the management of the National Airspace System. The Operations Center located at FAA headquarters receives notifications of incidents, including accidents and hijackings.<n>FAA Control Centers often receive information and make operational decisions independently of one another. On 9/11, the four hijacked aircraft were monitored mainly by the centers in Boston, New York, Cleveland, and Indianapolis. Each center thus had part of the knowledge of what was going on across the system. What Boston knew was not necessarily known by centers in New York, Cleveland, or Indianapolis, or for that matter by the Command Center in Herndon or by FAA headquarters in Washington.<n>Controllers track airliners such as the four aircraft hijacked on 9/11 primarily by watching the data from a signal emitted by each aircraft's transponder equipment. Those four planes, like all aircraft traveling above 10,000 feet, were required to emit a unique transponder signal while in flight.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
At 8:34, the Boston Center controller received a third transmission from American 11:<n>American 11: Nobody move please. We are going back to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves.<n>In the succeeding minutes, controllers were attempting to ascertain the altitude of the southbound flight.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
Between 9:01 and 9:02, a manager from New York Center told the Command Center in Herndon:<n>Manager, New York Center: We have several situations going on here. It's escalating big, big time. We need to get the military involved with us. . . . We're, we're involved with something else, we have other aircraft that may have a similar situation going on here.<n>The "other aircraft" referred to by New York Center was United 175. Evidence indicates that this conversation was the only notice received by either FAA headquarters or the Herndon Command Center prior to the second crash that there had been a second hijacking.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
While the Command Center was told about this "other aircraft" at 9:01, New York Center contacted New York terminal approach control and asked for help in locating United 175.<n>Terminal: I got somebody who keeps coasting but it looks like he's going into one of the small airports down there.<n>Center: Hold on a second. I'm trying to bring him up here and get you-There he is right there. Hold on.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
New England Region: Okay. Yeah, we gotta get-we gotta alert the military real quick on this.<n>Boston Center immediately advised the New England Region that it was going to stop all departures at airports under its control. At 9:05, Boston Center confirmed for both the FAA Command Center and the New England Region that the hijackers aboard American 11 said "we have planes." At the same time, New York Center declared "ATC zero"-meaning that aircraft were not permitted to depart from, arrive at, or travel through New York Center's airspace until further notice.<n>Within minutes of the second impact, Boston Center instructed its controllers to inform all aircraft in its airspace of the events in New York and to advise aircraft to heighten cockpit security. Boston Center asked the Herndon Command Center to issue a similar cockpit security alert nationwide. We have found no evidence to suggest that the Command Center acted on this request or issued any type of cockpit security alert.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
NEADS: Okay.<n>FAA: I'm going to try to confirm an ID for you, but I would assume he's somewhere over, uh, either New Jersey or somewhere further south.<n>NEADS: Okay. So American 11 isn't the hijack at all then, right? FAA: No, he is a hijack.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
At the suggestion of the Boston Center's military liaison, NEADS contacted the FAA's Washington Center to ask about American 11. In the course of the conversation, a Washington Center manager informed NEADS:"We're looking- we also lost American 77." The time was 9:34. This was the first notice to the military that American 77 was missing, and it had come by chance. If NEADS had not placed that call, the NEADS air defenders would have received no information whatsoever that the flight was even missing, although the FAA had been searching for it. No one at FAA headquarters ever asked for military assistance with American 77.<n>At 9:36, the FAA's Boston Center called NEADS and relayed the discovery about an unidentified aircraft closing in on Washington:"Latest report. Aircraft VFR [visual flight rules] six miles southeast of the White House. . . . Six, southwest. Six, southwest of the White House, deviating away." This startling news prompted the mission crew commander at NEADS to take immediate control of the airspace to clear a flight path for the Langley fighters:"Okay, we're going to turn it . . . crank it up. . . . Run them to the White House." He then discovered, to his surprise, that the Langley fighters were not headed north toward the Baltimore area as instructed, but east over the ocean." I don't care how many windows you break," he said." Damn it. . . . Okay. Push them back."<n>The Langley fighters were heading east, not north, for three reasons. First, unlike a normal scramble order, this order did not include a distance to the target or the target's location. Second, a "generic" flight plan-prepared to get the aircraft airborne and out of local airspace quickly-incorrectly led the Langley fighters to believe they were ordered to fly due east (090) for 60 miles. Third, the lead pilot and local FAA controller incorrectly assumed the flight plan instruction to go "090 for 60" superseded the original scramble order.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
There was no response.<n>Then, at 9:39, a fourth radio transmission was heard from United 93: Ziad Jarrah: Uh, this is the captain. Would like you all to remain seated. There is a bomb on board and are going back to the airport, and to have our demands [unintelligible]. Please remain quiet.<n>The controller responded: "United 93, understand you have a bomb on board. Go ahead." The flight did not respond.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington. Indeed, it is not clear to us that the video teleconference was fully under way before 9:37, when the Pentagon was struck.<n>Garvey, Belger, and other senior officials from FAA headquarters participated in this video teleconference at various times. We do not know who from Defense participated, but we know that in the first hour none of the personnel involved in managing the crisis did. And none of the information conveyed in the White House video teleconference, at least in the first hour, was being passed to the NMCC. As one witness recalled, "[It] was almost like there were parallel decisionmaking processes going on; one was a voice conference orchestrated by the NMCC . . . and then there was the [White House video teleconference]. . . . [I]n my mind they were competing venues for command and control and decisionmaking."<n>At 10:03, the conference received reports of more missing aircraft, "2 possibly 3 aloft," and learned of a combat air patrol over Washington. There was discussion of the need for rules of engagement. Clarke reported that they were asking the President for authority to shoot down aircraft. Confirmation of that authority came at 10:25, but the commands were already being conveyed in more direct contacts with the Pentagon.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing. Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room, but as far as we could determine, no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon. The focus was on the President's statement to the nation. The only decision made during this time was to return to Washington.<n>The President's motorcade departed at 9:35, and arrived at the airport between 9:42 and 9:45. During the ride the President learned about the attack on the Pentagon. He boarded the aircraft, asked the Secret Service about the safety of his family, and called the Vice President. According to notes of the call, at about 9:45 the President told the Vice President:"Sounds like we have a minor war going on here, I heard about the Pentagon. We're at war . . . somebody's going to pay."<n>About this time, Card, the lead Secret Service agent, the President's military aide, and the pilot were conferring on a possible destination for Air Force One. The Secret Service agent felt strongly that the situation in Washington was too unstable for the President to return there, and Card agreed. The President strongly wanted to return to Washington and only grudgingly agreed to go elsewhere. The issue was still undecided when the President conferred with the Vice President at about the time Air Force One was taking off. The Vice President recalled urging the President not to return to Washington. Air Force One departed at about 9:54 without any fixed destination. The objective was to get up in the air-as fast and as high as possible-and then decide where to go.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft.<n>The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, "Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do." Then she recalled hearing him say, "Yes sir." She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room.<n>We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt

During the 1920s and 1930s, Cokorde Gde Agung Sukawati, ruler of Ubud, extended a long Sukawati family tradition of patronizing talent and craftsmanship by hosting visiting Western artists, including the German painter, Walter Spies, who stayed for 14 years. Spies’ influence revolutionized painting in Bali, which had previously been one of the least inventive of Bali’s arts, bound by repetitive conventions. The Pita Maha school of young Western-influenced artists emerged (also influenced by the Dutch pastel-ist, Rudolf Bonnet), putting Ubud on the world map of contemporary art. Spies’ house and spring-fed swimming pool (now part of the Tjampuhan Hotel) were visited by Western artists, academics, musicians, and stars of theater and film. Deeply involved in Balinese culture, Spies himself choreographed the still-performed version of the most famous Balinese dance, the kecak, based on a story from the “Ramayana.” When Germany invaded Holland in 1940, Spies was interned as an enemy alien. He died in 1942, when a ship on which he was being transported to British Ceylon was torpedoed by the Japanese.<n>From 1900 until the start of World War II, many young Indonesians received a Dutch education, with the brightest students going to universities in the Netherlands. The Dutch language gave the vast polyglot archipelago a sense of unity, even among islands that had been bitter enemies for centuries. Indonesian nationalism and a movement for independence from Holland gained strength.<n>War and Independence<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-History.txt
In atmosphere, Sanur falls somewhere between the brash, noisy Kuta and secluded, pricey Nusa Dua. Half-hidden by tropical gardens and foliage, many of Sanur’s hotels are small in scale, and face the pleasant, sandy beach. The water is generally calm, protected from waves and undercurrents by an outlying coral reef. At high tide, the swimming is wonderful, but at low tide, the water dips to knee or waist level, and wading is the only activity possible. Beyond the reef are massive pounding waves, a challenge for experienced surfers.<n>Just inland, parallel to the beach, the town of Sanur looks at first like nothing more than a long strip of souvenir shops, clothing boutiques, and restaurants. But take a walk along some of the lanes leading off the main road, Jalan Tanjung Sari, or beyond the impatient traffic of the bypass (Jalan Bypass) and you’ll find traditional life still going on as if tourism had never happened. Many small Indonesian and seafood restaurants on the street are pleasant; one or two are outstanding. Sanur hotels provide the best top-bracket dining.<n>Only a short walk north along the shore from the ten-story Grand Bali Beach Hotel is the Le Mayeur Museum, once the house of the Belgian painter, Adrien Jean Le Mayeur. He came to Bali in 1932 and stayed to marry the beautiful Ni Pollok, who had been a well-known legong dancer (see page 88) before retiring (at 14!) to teach dance. In its day, the garden with its ponds and statues was open on the seaward side; now it is fully enclosed. The outside of the house is covered with stone carvings while the interior is a gallery of sculpture collected by Le Mayeur. The walls are hung with his own paintings: European landscapes, Balinese scenes, and studies of dancers, including Ni Pollok. When Le Mayeur died in 1958, the house was turned into a museum that his widow ran until her death in 1985.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
At Nusa Dua, the outside world — even the everyday Balinese world — is excluded. The name, meaning “two islands,” refers to two knobs of land sticking out from the coast in the middle of the reserve. They are not true islands but are each connected by a narrow neck of land. As at Sanur, when the tide is out, the water is too low for swimming, but most Nusa Dua hotels have vast swimming pools. There’s little traffic or noise, and no hassle from hawkers in this neatly manicured expensive hotel zone. A dozen luxury hotels sprawl amid spacious grounds next to dazzling white beaches, with two championship golf courses, a convention center at the Sheraton Nusa Indah Hotel, and the Galleria, a modern shopping and restaurant complex in the same area. Predictably, lower-priced hotels and affordable eating places line the 5 km (3 miles) of coast north of Nusa Dua’s hotel zone, all the way to Benoa. Once a dusty, somnolent fishing village, Benoa has turned into a watersports center of buzzing jet skis, motorboats, diving centers, and bars.<n>Don’t confuse Benoa village (Tanjung Benoa) with Benoa Port, on the opposite (north) side of the muddy inlet known as Benoa Harbor. Reached from the Sanur-Kuta road by a long causeway, the harbor is where cargo ships tie up. There is a charge for driving along the causeway to the jetty, and no reason for going to the end unless you plan to take the fast twin-hull, Maubua Express ferry to Lombok, a cruise to Nusa Lembongan, or a deep-sea fishing trip.<n>Jimbaran Beach is a great arc of sand facing a sheltered bay south of the airport, shared by a handful of resort hotels and a fishing village. More hotels are rapidly going up on a new access road that runs parallel to the coast here. Look for the sign to Uluwatu on the road from the airport toward Nusa Dua — you have to pass it and then make a U-turn. Jimbaran Beach is famous for its restaurants that serve fresh grilled fish and seafood on the beach.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt

All the way up the long flight of steps of this temple, and especially near the shrines, you’ll be eyed by monkeys that are friendly, assuming they’ve already been well fed. Bus tours converge on Uluwatu toward sunset, and the romance of the place is somewhat spoiled.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Lovina Beach<n>The beaches west of Singaraja began to attract escapist travelers in the early 1970s, and simple and fairly inexpensive accommodations were built to house them. Slowly the number of visitors grew and the small homestays turned themselves into larger bungalow-type hotels. Today, tour groups come for short stays and, as everywhere in Bali, standards and prices are steadily going up. Actually, Lovina is not one village but a string of small ones, starting 6 km (4 miles) west of Singaraja and continuing for 10 km (6 miles) up the coast road. Shops, restaurants, and moneychangers are scattered along the busy stretch.<n>The beach itself is shallow and gently shelving, making it an ideal place for small children. There is calm water on the inside of the reef and good snorkeling over it. Lovina’s dark sand is less inviting than the white or golden variety at the southern resorts, and gets too hot to walk on in bare feet in the middle of the day.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
You won’t find many notable temples, palaces, or other historic sites, but visitors to Lombok are rewarded with the pleasures of the island’s relaxed, rustic ways: the sight of water buffaloes and their calves; hens, and chicks dashing across your path; sudden views of blue sea dotted with sails. Most visitors stay in the hotels alongside Senggigi beach, but the far south and the offshore Gilis also have good beaches and snorkeling.<n>Some villages are renowned for their traditional crafts — intricate basketry, weaving, pottery, or carving. A few of them have realized the chances of increasing the flow of tourist traffic, setting up stalls by the roadside or getting younger members of the family to bring visitors to have a look at the work going on. For an insight into village life, it’s worth inquiring about the timing of local market days, held in the mornings once or twice a week in many towns and villages. Roads are refreshingly free of traffic; a prime source of motive power is still the tiny ponies pulling unlikely loads in two-wheeled traps.<n>Ampenan, Mataram, and Cakranegara<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Barcelona is hardly Madrid or Seville when it comes to tablaos—live flamenco performances, though a few shows target the tourist trade: Tablao Flamenco Cordobés (Las Ramblas, 35; Tel. 93/317 66 53) is the most popular and predictable, while El Patio Andaluz (Aribau, 242; Tel 93/209 33 78) also puts on sevillanas, more traditional southern-style singing and dancing. There are also flamenco shows twice nightly, except Monday, at El Tablao de Carmen in the Poble Espanyol on Montjuïc (Arcos, 9; tel. 93/325 68 95).<n>For one-stop partying among those interested more in convenience than quality, the Poble Espanyol features jazz clubs, flamenco performances, big-bands, theater, bars, and discos going strong until 4am.<n>Two classic Barcelona cafes that are perfect for getting started or winding down are Café de la Ópera (La Rambla, 74) and Els Quatre Gats (Montsió, 3). An excellent wine bar, with a great list of Spanish wines, is El Senyor de la Vinya, right across from the Santa María del Mar church. In good weather, it and another nearby bar set tables out in the plaza, which is unequaled for ambience. A cavernous bodega that became immediately popular with wine lovers is the new but ancient-looking Va de Vi (Banys Vells, 16), near the Picasso Museum. It features a superb wine list and excellent tapas, cheeses and embutidos (Spanish hams, sausages and other cold cuts). El Xampanet (Montcada, 22) is an immensely popular cava bar always full of chatty locals. Schilling (Ferran, 23) draws a smoky European crowd of late-night smokers. Boadas (c/ dels Taller, 1) is a cocktail bar that looks like a movie set for a shoot of 1940s Havana. Bar London (c/ Nou de la Rambla, 34) is a rough-and-tumble place with occasional live jazz and rock. In a gorgeous medieval palace at c/ Montcada, 20, Espai Barroc is a sumptuous, pricey bar that looks like something out of The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, the Peter Greenaway film.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt
El Molino (Vila i Vila, 99) is one of Barcelona’s oldest cabarets. Cabaret of the distinctly kitschy kind is the nightly rule at Bodega Bohemia (Lancaster, 2), on the west side of La Rambla. Live jazz most nights of the week can be found at Harlem Jazz Club in the Gothic Quarter (c/ Comtessa de Sobradiel, 8), probably the city’s best jazz club. For live flamenco or pop flamenco, head to Los Tarantos, or for jazz, to Jamboree, both on the Plaça Reial.<n>Luz de Gas (Muntaner, 246) and Otto Zutz (Lincoln, 15) continue to be the reigning dance clubs, which don’t get going until well after midnight. The latest in modern dance, music, and experimental theater is regularly staged in the evenings at the Mercat de les Flors, the old flower market a short walk from the spectacular sound-and-light show of the Font Màgica (see page 68).<n>If you’re lucky enough to be in the city during a festival—either a religious or secular holiday—you’ll see the city’s different neighborhoods erupt into a carnival. Food, fireworks, music, costumes, and especially the huge papier-mâché effigies called gégants (giants) and their comical companions, the cabezudos (bigheads), are essential fiesta features. Each neighborhood has its own identifying models. The gégants are about 4 meters (13 feet) high and elaborately dressed as kings and queens, knights, ladies, gentlemen, and country folk. Cabezudos, meanwhile, are usually oversize cartoon heads of well-known personalities or types. They prance about mischievously, accosting people in the crowd.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt
From its beginnings more than two thousand years ago, Barcelona has grown outwards in rings, like concentric ripples on a pond. The ancient core is a hill the Romans called Mons Taber, where they raised a temple to Augustus Caesar and in the fourth century a.d. built high walls about a mile around to protect their settlement. This is the nucleus of the medieval district called the Barri Gòtic. While much of it is not technically Gothic, it is a remarkable concentration of medieval palaces, convents, and churches.<n>The best place to begin a tour of the quarter is the Catedral — Barcelona’s superb cathedral, which is the neighborhood’s major site and focal point. The cathedral was begun in 1298 on the site of earlier churches going back to Visigothic times. The final touch — the rather florid Gothic façade — was not completed until the end of the 19th century and thus contrasts with the simple octagonal towers. The ribs of the cathedral’s high vault are joined at carved and painted keystone medallions, a typically Catalan feature. In the center of the nave is a splendid Gothic choir with lacy spires of carved wood. Above these are the heraldic emblems of the European kings and princes invited by Charles V to be members of his exclusive Order of the Golden Fleece (Toison d’Or). The first and only meeting was held in the cathedral in 1519. The seats reserved for Henry VIII of England and François I of France are next to the emperor’s, but they didn’t bother to come.<n>Connected to the choir is a pulpit with an exceptional wrought-iron stair rail. Ahead, steps under the altar lead to the alabaster tomb of Santa Eulàlia, one of the city’s two patron saints, martyred in the fourth century. On the wall of the right aisle are the tombs of Count Ramón Berenguer I and his wife Almodis, who founded the earlier cathedral on this spot in 1058 — each was apparently very short. Don’t miss the Catalan Gothic altarpieces in the chapels behind the altar; the nine panels of the Transfiguration painted for the San Benito chapel in the 15th century by Bernat Martorell are considered his masterpiece.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
For live jazz, the best bets are the CD Café Jazz Club (Third Ring Road East) on weekends and the Sanwei Bookstore (60 Fuxingmenwai Dajie) on Friday nights. Beijing’s plushest jazz club — often attracting international performers to its piano bar — is Aria, an upscale bar and grill located in the China World Hotel (1 Jianguomenwai Dajie).<n>Fans of disco (which is not a dying fad in Beijing) have made the Hot Spot (south of the Jiangguang New World Hotel) the hottest dance venue in town, with stage shows and caged dancers going strong every night until 2am. Other popular disco venues include NASA (2 Xitucheng Lu, Haidian District), stuffed with military motifs, and Poachers Inn the Park (Tuanjiehu Park), with its English pub and stone dance floor. The most international late-night dance floor is at Beijing’s own Hard Rock Cafe (8 Dongsanhuan Bei Lu), the first such franchise in China, with hamburgers, fries, beer, a Chinese staff, and live (and loud) music nightly.<n>Recreation and Sports<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhatToDo.txt
Berlin showed its sense of the times with its mastery of film, the 20th-century art form. Fritz Lang, F.W. Murnau, G.W. Pabst, and Ernst Lubitsch were the leading directors of their generation. While Hollywood had considered cinema to be principally an industry of mass entertainment, the Berlin film-makers added a new perception of its artistic possibilities with M, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Lulu, and Nosferatu. After seeing Fritz Lang’s premonitory fable of human regimentation, Metropolis, Hitler wanted the master of the dark spectacle to make publicity films for him.<n>Berlin was going through a wild time, but the Versailles peace treaty had laid heavy burdens on the nation. At the start of the twenties, inflation had made little more than nonsense of the German currency, and political assassinations became routine. The most significant of the victims was foreign minister Walther Rathenau, an enlightened democrat and Jew who was killed near the Grunewald forest. It was also the time of vicious street battles between Communists and Nazis, exploiting the social disruptions of inflation and unemployment that were impossible to ignore.<n>The Third Reich<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-History.txt

The Museum of Fine Arts (or MFA) contains one of the most important art collections in the country. There’s much — too much — to absorb in one visit, so choose particular galleries or take a Highlights Tour leaflet and pick out just a few works. For example, the museum’s outstanding collections of Asian works include Japanese armor, Javanese statue gods, Thai Buddhas, and Indian elephants. There are first-rate Egyptian galleries with mummies and early sculptures, and Nubian statues and stelae. The American galleries feature a full cupboard of silver made by Paul Revere, and his portrait (among many others) by John Singleton Copley, who was probably Boston’s best-known artist. The complete pantheon of European art is represented — from the Italian Renaissance to English landscape painters. The most overwhelming rooms are those exhibiting works by 19th-century French artists, containing dozens of Monets, Millet’s The Sower, Renoir’s Dance at Bougival, and works by Cézanne, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Van Gogh. There’s also a great museum shop, a café, and a restaurant.<n>Nothing in Boston can match the beauty of the courtyard in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Modeled on a Venetian loggia, the cloister, delicate arches, and salmon-pink marble walls enclose a stunning, atmospheric space lined with mosaic and filled with foliage and classical statuary. Isabella Gardner created Fenway Court in 1903 to hold her outstanding collection of art. A flamboyant New Yorker, her unconventional ways scandalized the Boston Brahmins on more than one occasion. Her portrait by John Singer Sargent (in the Gothic Room) captures her individuality and her eccentricity lives on in her will, which stipulates that all of the 2,000 pieces on display in the house must be left exactly where they are. This decree is qualified by the condition that were anything to change, the museum’s contents would be sold off, with the proceeds going to Harvard University. It’s an extraordinary place filled with great art works which are displayed idiosyncratically in often (for the time) innovative ways. It’s more a personal home than a museum and the works are often poorly lit and cursorily labeled. Each of the rooms displays art of a particular artist — Titian, Raphael, or Veronese — or style — Dutch, Gothic, or early Italian.<n>A Night Out withthe Red Sox<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
A shuttle bus runs between Kendall Square, at the eastern edge of the MIT campus, and the CambridgeSide Galleria. The impressive waterfront mall has a number of large department stores and many smaller specialty shops.<n>You could spend a whole day in the Museum of Science complex that straddles the Charles River, playing and learning on the 400-plus interactive exhibits. Some of these, such as those on mathematics and biotechnology would stimulate an MIT graduate, while many others appeal to young children. Highlights include: the electron microscope that magnifies objects 25,000 times; a variety of dinosaur models and fossils; games that show how the human body works; stimulating games for learning about energy; and a rain forest re-creation. The demonstrations are thrilling too. Try to catch the world’s biggest Van de Graaff generator going through its paces at the Theater of Electricity. In late 1999 The Museum of Science announced that it was merging with the old Computer Museum and so the museum now has a couple of interactive computer-oriented exhibits.<n>There are also laser and stargazing shows in the Planetarium, and brilliant 3-D films shown in the Mugar Omni Theater. River trips offering good views of Back Bay leave from the Galleria and the Science Museum (see page 110).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
Balatonfüred, some 13 km (8 miles) farther west, has a history as a spa stretching back to Roman times. The main square, called Gyógy tér (meaning Health/Therapeutic Square), is a handsome place where the local mineral water bubbles up from the ground beneath a pagoda-like well-head. On three sides of the square stand grand old buildings: the 18th-century Horváth House, once an inn, now a miner’s sanatorium; the Trade Union Sanatorium of 1802, and the Cardiac Hospital, which has treated heart patients from all over the world. The small grove in front of the square has a number of trees dedicated by personalities who have visited here, including Indira Gandhi.<n>Just off the square is Blaha Lujza utca, with a ﬁne 1867 villa. On the opposite side of the road is the best coffee house on the lake: Kedves has been going strong for two centuries and once you’ve tasted their chocolate cake you’ll understand why. At the end of this street is a rotund church built in the 1840s, and a small museum to the Hungarian author Mór Jókai (closed November to February). It is not all cures, coffee, and culture here: Balatonfüred is also one of the lake’s liveliest resorts, bustling by day and night.<n>One of the most attractive spots on Lake Balaton is the village of Tihany. The place gives its name to a peninsula which almost cuts the lake in two and ends at the ferry point of Tihanyi-rév, where there is a Club Med-style camp and hotel offering a gamut of entertainment. The peninsula is unspoiled and protected by its National Park status. It even has its own small lake, popular with bird-watchers and nature lovers. To the south are the domes of former geysers.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
Russian Hill is less opulent than Nob Hill, but the gardens and immaculate little cottages of this fashionable residential area make it far more appealing.<n>The roller-coaster dips and crests of the city’s hills, breaking up the monotony of the standard grid system of streets, reach a crazy climax on Lombard Street between Hyde and Leavenworth. After you’ve negotiated all eight hairpin bends lined with gardens of hydrangeas, you’re not going to quibble about the claim that it’s the “crookedest street in the world.” Two blocks south is Filbert Street, boasting the steepest slope — a stomach-churning 31.5 percent gradient, with no bends.<n>It is worth climbing to the top of Telegraph Hill for the view of the bay from the top of Coit Tower, built in 1934 to honor the city’s fire department. One of San Francisco’s many landmarks, its shape is not meant to resemble the nozzle of a fire hose, as is so often reported. Inside you will find Socialist Realist murals depicting “Life in California, 1934.” Take a look at the cottages and gardens around the Greenwich Steps, clinging to the steep slope overlooking the bay — this is one of the city’s most desirable addresses.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
Portsmouth Square, between Clay and Washington streets, was the city’s original town square, where Sam Brannan announced the discovery of gold in 1848 (see page 16). But what really grabs your attention is the chatter of Chinese voices, the crowds, the color, the smells of five-spice and dried shrimp — it’s a little corner of Hong Kong right in the middle of California.<n>At Columbus Avenue, Chinatown spills over into North Beach, a Little Italy of cafés, bakeries, restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee houses. This lively neighborhood, the center of the Italian community, was once the focus of the city’s intellectual and artistic life. From the days when the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti gathered fellow Beats around his City Lights Bookstore during the 1950s, North Beach has been a hangout for the bohemian literary crowd. City Lights (261 Columbus Avenue; open daily until midnight) opened in 1953 and was America’s first paperback bookshop. It’s still going strong today.<n>Once you’ve bought your copy of On the Road, cross Jack Kerouac Street and settle down with your purchase over a drink at Vesuvio’s, another famous literary hangout. Or if it’s a sunny day, buy a sandwich from a delicatessen and enjoy a picnic on Washington Square, a splash of green overlooked by the white spires of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul, where Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio were married in 1954.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
On Church Street you’ll find the site of Father Serra’s original adobe church. Rebuilt in 1795, it is now the Royal Presidio Chapel (or Cathedral of San Carlos de Borromeo). By the waterfront is the Customs House Plaza, with the Maritime Museum, as well as the Old Custom House (1827), where the American flag was raised by Commodore John Sloat in 1846 when he claimed Monterey for the United States.<n>Beside the Plaza is Monterey’s Fisherman’s Wharf. Like San Francisco’s, it is a collection of souvenir shops and restaurants on the dock, offering a great view across the boats in the marina. The fish on sale is most definitely fresh, but alas, no longer abundant enough to keep Cannery Row going as more than a weather-beaten curiosity. The famous sardine fisheries finally closed down in the 1940s as a result of over-fishing, but the waterfront district of timbered canneries, immortalized by the novelist John Steinbeck as “a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia,” has found a new lease on life today as a tourist attraction with souvenir shops, delightful cozy boutiques, and artists’ studios.<n>One old cannery building has been splendidly converted to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, one of the premier aquariums in the world as well as an educational showcase for the unique underwater environment of Monterey Bay. The centerpiece is the stunning 30-ft- (10-m-) deep Kelp Forest Tank, a window on California’s most important marine habitat. Kids will love the Sea Otter Pool and the Touch Pools, where they can both handle and learn about sea anemones, crabs, and even bat rays.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
William Lyon Mackenzie King, who became leader of the Liberal Party after Laurier’s death, made Canada progressively more independent of Britain. At the Imperial Conference of 1926 he won the acknowledgement that Canada was autonomous in external affairs and thus not subject to a common, British-dominated policy for the whole Empire. This led to the 1931 Statute of Westminster, which effected the equality of Britain and the Dominions, thus consecrating Canada’s full autonomy in home and foreign affairs. The governor general in Ottawa became the symbolic representative of the Crown rather than of the British government. But the provinces insisted that the Constitution remain with London rather than let Ottawa infringe on their prerogatives.<n>At the same time, the country came more and more into the American economic and cultural orbit. The boom years of the 1920s saw the growth of a “branch-plant economy;” with American automobile, rubber, chemical, and clothing factories springing up around the Great Lakes at Hamilton, Oshawa, Windsor, and Montréal. The boom in American popular culture inundated Canada with radio, movies, and mass-market magazines. Québec, in particular, tried to resist the invasion, even going so far as to ban adolescents from cinemas. Apart from the Group of Seven, a spirited band of Ontario painters who were seeking a distinctive “national” style, most Canadian-born artists — actors, musicians, and writers — felt obliged to seek fame and fortune in New York, London, or Paris.<n>Canada’s Great Depression was felt first by farmers in the Prairie Provinces, unable to get rid of their surplus from the wheat glut of 1928. Even the drought in 1929 did not ease matters, and ten more years of bad harvests meant they would not recoup their losses. Other sectors of the economy — timber, fisheries, mining, and construction — ground to a halt as production outstripped demand. Spirits were raised by the escapist fare of the new Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, today’s C.B.C. — Hollywood extravaganzas, and home-grown media stunts, not the least of which was the hullabaloo surrounding the Dionne quintuplets, born in Ontario in 1934.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt
In the Arctic region, the stabilization of the sea level and a dramatic cooling of the climate around 1500 b.c. caused hunters to switch from land mammals to fish, seal, walrus, whale, and ice-dwelling polar bear. At the same time, these ancestors of the Inuit moved out of their skin tents into warmer igloos of hardened snow blocks. They glided over the ice on skates of ivory or antler horn. From the Yukon, further migrations took them north to the High Arctic, south around Hudson Bay to Manitoba, east to Greenland, and down the Labrador coast to Newfoundland.<n>For the West Coast peoples, as the song says, the living was easy. The fish were indeed jumping; bountiful salmon were barbecued in the summertime, smoked for the winter. Prehistoric techniques for fishing and trapping have continued right into modern times, though bone has been replaced by steel in the weapons. One of British Columbia’s favorite freshwater fishing sites, at Hell’s Gate in Fraser Canyon, has been going strong for 9,000 years. Prairie Indians hunted buffalo by forcing the herds onto marshland, snowbanks, thin ice, or over cliffs — one of these nasty surprises being known to this day as the Head-Smashed-In buffalo jump, near Fort MacLeod, Alberta. Already in 3000 b.c. these people were drying and smoking strips of meat — modern beef jerky. In Ontario and Québec, where encroaching forests gradually dispersed the herds of caribou, the Iroquois ousted the Algonquin and settled down to cultivate maize, beans, and squash, living in rectangular, multifamily longhouses.<n>The Inuit<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-History.txt
July and August guarantee the best weather, though it can get very hot in Montréal, Toronto, and the Prairie Provinces (aggravated in those provinces by the hot chinook wind off the Rockies). Farther to the north, mosquitoes can be a problem in summer. Connoisseurs of the forests of Québec and the Maritimes favor the spectacular autumn from September to mid-October. While the West Coast is mild in May and June, in central and eastern Canada you’ll still find snow on the ground in May and a nip in the air into the month of June. The period from November to April is strictly for winter sports enthusiasts.<n>Remember the old adage: There’s no bad weather, only bad clothing. In addition to your light summer wear, be sure to bring a sweater for the occasional chilly evenings. Rather than weighing down your luggage with anything cumbersome, take a leaf out of the Canadians’ book and keep warm by wearing several layers. If you’re thinking of going north, consider long underwear. In any case, don’t forget a raincoat, especially for British Columbia. Important everywhere is a good pair of walking shoes — something light but more solid than tennis shoes.<n>How<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
You might face severe punishment from those very proud Torontonians if you don’t begin your waterfront tour with a trip up the CN Tower. This handsome, outsize TV antenna makes up for its unimaginative name (from its builder, the Canadian National railway and telecommunications company) with all the fanciful interpretations of its shape: jousting lance, hypodermic needle, serpent frozen rigid while swallowing a football. At 605 m (1,815 ft), it is currently the world’s highest freestanding structure, 19 m (56 ft) more than a similar monster in Moscow.<n>A plexiglass elevator whizzes you up the outside of the tower to two observation decks in the Skypod. The ride is free for those going to the revolving restaurant or nightclub (which also rank as the world’s highest, if you don’t count a couple in the Rockies, Alps, and Himalayas). The view at the top reveals a whole history of Toronto in the contrast between the glass-and-steel skyscraper canyons of the financial district, the geometric dome and cantilevered structures of the Ontario Place leisure complex, and the old-fashioned gabled houses of the neighborhoods.<n>Take a second elevator to the Space Deck, to get the full sweep of Lake Ontario’s so-called “Golden Horseshoe.” Including Toronto, this dense urban belt from Oshawa in the east to Hamilton and St. Catharines in the west houses half the total population of the province. More romantically, you can catch a glimpse of Niagara Falls and peer across the border to Buffalo.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Across the street from the ROM, the George R. Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art offers a very attractive way of acquiring an instant history of ceramics from 2000 b.c. to the 18th century. The huge collection includes pre-Columbian earthenware figures, brilliant Italian Renaissance Majolica, more sedate but elegant Dutch and English Delftware of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the Rococo forms of German Meissen porcelain. In front of the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO), 317 Dundas Street West, an intense Henry Moore bronze, Large Two Forms, proclaims the museum’s outstanding feature: North America’s finest collection of the Briton’s works. The Henry Moore Sculpture Centre occupies a whole wing designed by the artist himself. The 600 pieces of the collection shown on a rotation basis include major works, small-scale bronze models, sketches, and paintings. But it’s the great plaster casts in their sometimes brutal original state that give the visitor a unique opportunity to see a representative sample of the monumental pieces that grace public squares and university quadrangles all over the world. Besides the celebrated reclining figures, look for the formidable skull-like design from which the Nuclear Energy monument was cast for the University of Chicago.<n>The AGO’s Walker Gallery exhibits sculpture by fellow Briton Barbara Hepworth, as well as Rodin, Dégas, and Maillol. The European collection of paintings includes important works by Tintoretto, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Rubens, Frans Hals, Jan van Goyen, and Poussin. An Ontario collection gives a prominent place to British painters, including Hogarth, Raeburn, Reynolds, and Gainsborough. Among the Impressionists and their followers represented here are Renoir, Pissarro, Monet, Cézanne, and Van Gogh. “Moderns” include Matisse, Picasso, and Braque. The Canadian collection provides a comprehensive survey of 200 years of Canadian painting, pride of place going to Emily Carr, Tom Thomson, and members of the influential Group of Seven.<n>Two museums on the city outskirts are well worth the trip. The marvelously entertaining Ontario Science Centre stands 11 km (6 miles) northeast of the city center (770 Don Mills Rd.). Here, adults and children are expected to participate, and they do so enthusiastically in what turns into a sophisticated push-button play center, focused as much on the future as the past and present —  proving that science can be fun.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Fiestas<n>The Spanish colonists carried on the traditions of their mother country, and to this day there are yearly fiestas in most major towns. Many mark Saint’s days or founding days, and the whole population will dress up and enjoy lots of singing and dancing. Most have a religious procession to start the proceedings. The major fiestas are listed in the Calendar of Events (see page 92), but ask the tourist information office about what’s going on during your stay.<n>The city of Mérida seems to be in the throes of a constant fiesta, hosting live cultural shows at sites around the downtown area. Here you will find the most authentic cultural displays in the region. The program changes nightly from ballet to traditional Yucatecan folk music and dances, and all the performances are free. There are special performances on the famed Mérida Domingos (Mérida Sundays), lasting all day but for a short break in the heat of the afternoon, and coinciding with a huge market. On Sunday evenings Mexican families take to the streets to meet friends and family, dance, and generally have a good time.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhatToDo.txt
This became patently clear during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, in which the inadequacy of the Chinese army was starkly displayed. Japan and Western powers were dismantling the Chinese Empire. Demands for reform won the support of the emperor, but his notoriously scheming aunt, the Empress Dowager Cixi (Tz’u Hsi), edged him off the throne. Soon after, Cixi had the chance to exploit the Boxer Rebellion (1900), a revolt against foreign influence. It was finally put down by the intervention of all the great powers, which joined together in an unprecedented alliance. China was saddled with payment of a humiliating indemnity and a further loss of respect.<n>The elderly empress died in 1908, one day after the mysterious death of her nephew, the unseated emperor. The heir apparent was a two-year-old prince, Puyi — hardly the leader the dynasty and the nation needed in the face of civil disorder and foreign threats. Less than three years later, an army uprising took place in Wuhan and quickly won widespread support. The success of the revolution surprised many observers. It came so suddenly that Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the inveterate revolutionary who had led several earlier insurrections, was still abroad at the time. He returned in triumph to accept the presidency of the Chinese Republic. With a stroke of the brush, the Manchu Dynasty and its child-emperor surrendered in 1911. The imperial tradition, going back thousands of years, was snapped like a twig.<n>Unity Eludes the Chinese<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-History.txt
Reed Flute Cave (Ludiyan) burrows deep into a hill, while on the surface grow reeds suitable for making flutes. The visions within are strange indeed and benefit from good lighting effects. As in most other caverns, certain formations have been given poetic names. Apart from Virgin Forest and Giant Lion, there is one huge rock that suggests the form of an Old Scholar, seated in contemplation of a simulated waterfall across the way. According to legend, a scholar tried to write a poem worthy of the cave’s beauty, but before he could find adequate words he had turned to stone. The cave’s largest chamber, called the Crystal Palace, can accommodate a thousand people. Bats inhabit the darker recesses, but the eerie waters that flow through the cave have no fish.<n>Seven Star Cave (Qixingyan) is a mere million years old and has been a tourist attraction for more than a thousand years. Some of the scenic formations of stalactites and stalagmites have names like Old Banyan Tree Welcoming Guests and Dragon Splashing Water, providing an idea of the poetic license enjoyed by Chinese cave explorers. The round-trip tour of this cave is considerably longer than the itinerary in the Reed Flute Cave. Both underworlds have constant, comfortable temperatures year ‘round, but they are dripping with a humidity that makes the going slippery. Another attraction of Seven Star Park is its Forest of Steles, a cliff where poems and pictures have been carved into rock over the past 1,500 years.<n>An Amusement Park<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
East from Ágios Nikólaos<n>Heading east from Ágios Nikólaos the road along the northern coast is in the long process of being updated. Follow the gulf south to Istro where there are a cluster of hotels, and then on along the coastal plain to one of the major ancient sites in the east — Gourniá, 18 km (11 miles) south of Ágios Nikólaos. Myriad stone walls — foundations for multi-storied homes — linked by cobbled streets blanket the hillside site of Gourniá. Here more than any other site it is possible to envision ordinary Minoans going about their business. You’ll be able to explore the marketplace and workshops of the artisans.<n>The palace sat at the top of the hill, its west court housing sacrificial slab and magazines for storage of ritual liquids and libations as seen in other Minoan palaces. Gourniá was a large city, stretching down to the coast where it had an important port. Much remains to be discovered under the low scrub and rocks though there seems little intent to do so. The best overview of Gourniá — excavated by American Harriet Boyd Hawkes in the early 1900s — is from the main road as it rises beyond the archaeological site.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Entertainment<n>Although cultural activity has been under state control since the revolution and Havana no longer sizzles with the sleazy Mafia-funded casinos and clubs of the 1950s, both high culture and more down-to-earth nightlife thrive in Cuba. Outside the resorts, it can be hard to pin down what’s going on where, but informal musical performances are ubiquitous. In the resorts, nightlife is focused around hotels, ranging from decent live bands, dance, and fashion shows to mimed Beatles sing-a-longs.<n>Live Music Performances<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhatToDo.txt
Live Music Performances<n>Cubans crave live music, and — with the surge in international popularity of traditional Cuban music — so do most visitors to Cuba. You certainly won’t have to go out of your way to hear music performances. Roving groups of musicians can be found playing everywhere from airports to restaurants. Merely wandering the streets of Havana, Santiago, or Trinidad, you’re likely to stumble across a party with a live band, or even a back alley where some impromptu jamming is going on. On Saturday nights in Camagüey, the music spreads to the streets in a “Noche Camagüeya” block party along Calle República.<n>All the styles of Cuba’s delectable traditional music �� habaneras, son, boleros, guarachas, guajiras, and more — can be heard in every town’s casa de la trova, usually a fine old building on or near the main square. Performances are amateur and professional, take place afternoons and evenings, and are free or have a minimal cover charge (US$1–$2). Especially in the evenings and on weekends, when you’ll encounter a vibrant mix of Cubans and foreigners, the island’s casas de la trova really swing. The most famous is in Santiago de Cuba (which has sprung many a star), while those in towns like Trinidad, Baracoa, and Camagüey are especially charming.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhatToDo.txt
That Baracoa was the first settlement to be established by Diego Velázquez in 1511 — making it the oldest colonial city in the Americas — is not in doubt. However, locals also claim that Columbus first landed at this spot (rather than near Gibara, north and west of here, as most historians believe). They insist that Columbus planted the Cruz de la Parra (Cross of the Vine) in the soil on his arrival. The cross is on display in Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, the church on Plaza Independencia. (Whatever the truth of the matter, carbon dating has established that the cross is more than 500 years old.)<n>Baracoa, though, has so much going for it that any associations with Columbus are a bonus. A good place to get your bearings is the hilltop Hotel El Castillo, a former castle looking out over old red-tiled roofs, the town’s oyster-shaped bay, and the landmark mountain known as “El Yunque” (“The Anvil”), so named on account of its singular shape.<n>On Calle Antonio Maceo, you’ll find people queuing for hot chocolate drinks in the baking tropical sun at Casa del Chocolate. Opposite is a charming Casa de la Trova, with rooftop performances. In the main square is a striking bust of Hatuey, the brave Indian leader who resisted early conquistadores until he was caught by the Spanish and burned at the stake. Also wander along the Malecón, the seaside avenue, from the snug Fuerte Matachín (an early 19th-century fort that has a small municipal museum attached) to the Hotel La Rusa, named after a legendary and glamorous Russian émigrée who over the years hosted celebrities from Che and Fidel to Errol Flynn.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
Modern Times<n>When India became independent in 1947, pressure for change mounted within Nepal. In 1950, King Tribhuvan pretended he was going on a shooting picnic and managed to escape to India. An uprising spread against the Ranas, and Prime Minister Mohan Shumshere Rana resigned in 1951. King Tribhuvan returned, a first constitution for the monarchy was installed, and some foreigners were allowed into Nepal. Two years later, Mount Everest was conquered.<n>King Mahendra acceded to the throne on the death of his father Tribhuvan in 1955. After an experiment with elections and parliamentary democracy, King Mahendra abolished the constitution in 1962 and instituted the system of “panchayat democracy.” Road-building and airport construction progressed during his reign.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-History.txt
Planning and Preparation<n>There are basically three styles of trekking. You can book through a private agency that will plan your itinerary and provide everything: from down jackets, sleeping bags, and food and drink to sirdar (guide), cook, and porters who will set up the tents at campsites. Alternatively, you can hire a guide and/or porter and do a lodge-to-lodge trek, which involves very little planning and allows you to do your hiking with only a light day-pack on your back. The last — and cheapest — alternative is to carry your own pack and strike out with a good trekking guidebook but no Nepali guide or porter. Most people who opt for this latter type of trek stay in the numerous and increasingly more comfortable trailside lodges that can be found on the major trekking routes. By staying in lodges, you avoid having to carry a tent, food, or cooking gear. A luxury trek in the first category might cost $100 or more per day per person. Hiring a guide and porter will lower your daily costs to somewhere around $20 or $25, while going it alone (meaning without a guide, as trekking without any companion should not be attempted) can be done for less than $10 a day.<n>October and November are the most popular trekking months because they are warm and sunny, and the trails are dry after the monsoon. December is good for low-level treks, though it will be getting cold at higher altitudes. The winter months bring the clearest skies. Spring comes in March and April, when rhododendrons and other flowers set the forests ablaze with color. In spring the skies gradually become hazy and there are light rains, which can make flights to starting points unpredictable. By May it is hot in Pokhara, the high peaks are rarely visible, and humidity mounts until the weather breaks in June, with the onset of the monsoon. Trails during the monsoon are muddy, slippery, and leech-ridden, which makes trekking between June and October a miserable experience. It is possible to fly to higher elevations where leeches are less of a problem, but the rainclouds make mountain flights particularly dangerous.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
On the Trail<n>Trekking isn’t mountain climbing, but it also isn’t just a stroll in the park. It’s walking, with lots of uphills and downhills. Almost anyone can go trekking, though a trek is definitely more enjoyable if you’re reasonably fit. Sure there are lots of athletes on the trail who seem to be here merely for the challenge, but you’ll also come across groups of the less physically fit, including school groups from the international school in Kathmandu and organized senior citizens’ treks, going happily along at their own pace.<n>As you hike, whether with a fully loaded backpack or just a light daypack, you can’t help marveling at the burdens that porters carry in their dokos (baskets). Everything not made or grown in the villages has to he packed in on the backs of wiry, barefoot porters, who carry loads of as much as 60 kg (130 pounds). Even more amazing is the fact that these baskets have no shoulder straps but only tump lines (forehead straps). You may notice that going downhill, porters take short steps on the balls of their feet with their knees bent. Do the same and you’ll avoid the common complaint of “trekker’s knee.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt

Buffaloes and goats are milked, and millet is threshed by pounding the stalks on the threshing floor. Women and girls troop to and from water taps with their water jars, while small children rock babies slung in baskets under the thatched eaves of stone-walled houses. Grain is taken to water-driven mills for grinding, or in some cases is ground between two flat stones or pounded in a mortar by a foot-operated rocker-beam pestle. In recent years numerous hydroelectric projects throughout the Annapurna and Solu-Khumbu regions have brought moderately reliable electricity to remote villages. However, this electricity is usually only available for a few hours in the evening. With electricity available, it is now possible to watch CNN (via satellite dish) from a remote lodge many days’ walk from the nearest road.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
Trekking Tips<n>Good hiking boots are the most important equipment for trekkers. Although some people trek in running shoes and even flip-flops (and Nepali porters go barefoot), it is advisable to wear sturdy hiking boots with lug soles and especially solid ankle support. A second pair of athletic shoes or river sandals can be packed for changing into at day’s end. A light pair of sock liners covered by heavier woolen socks or a pair of high-tech sweat-wicking sports socks make for comfort going up- and downhill. Be sure to have a roll of moleskin or adhesive plaster to put on your heels or other friction spots before blisters form, and to make a cushioned pad around any blister. Tight pants, such as blue jeans, can make for very uncomfortable climbing. Looser pants, shorts, or, for women, a calf-length loose skirt (such skirts are widely sold in Kathmandu and Pokhara) are recommended. You’ll also need extra socks (keep a dry pair separate for putting on at the end of the day), a couple of changes of pants and shirts, a wool sweater or synthetic fleece jacket, and a down jacket.<n>Take a flashlight (torch), binoculars, sun hat and sunscreen, sunglasses, water bottle, and pocket knife. In your backpack carry a first-aid kit with disinfectant, gauze pads and adhesive tape, elastic bandage (Ace Bandage) for sprains, insect repellent, tincture of iodine to sterilize water (four drops to a liter), throat lozenges, aspirin, a small pair of scissors, safety pins, and a thermometer. Get your doctor to prescribe a treatment for diarrhea and a wide-spectrum antibiotic. You may be many days from the nearest medical care and will have to doctor yourself and possibly others.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
There are few telephones or radios from which messages may be sent in the mountains or where medical help can be found. Find out where these may be on your route. Helicopters may be chartered from various companies in Kathmandu at the princely sum of about $2000 for a few hours, payable in advance. It can take as much as 24 hours, including time for the message to get through, for a rescue to be arranged. Porters can also carry a sick or injured person.<n>Register with your embassy and let them know where you’re going and when, and do not trek alone; find a companion through a trekking agency or by posting a notice on one of the many bulletin boards in Thamel.<n>White-Water Rafting<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
Entertainment<n>For comprehensive listing of what’s going on in Paris while you are there, buy one of the weekly guides, Pariscope (with an English-language supplement) or L’Officiel des Spectacles.<n>The cinema is a great national passion, with over 300 different films showing in Paris every week. For undubbed versions with French subtitles, look out for the letters VO (version originale) in listings or posters. Cinemas on the Champs-Elysées, in Montparnasse, St-Germain-des-Prés, Bastille, and the Forum des Halles all show VO movies.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhatToDo.txt
Poland is not an obvious place to take children, perhaps, and in fact few foreigners who haven’t been posted overseas in Poland seem to do it. Traveling with children in Poland is a matter of being flexible, creative, and putting together disparate activities to keep the kids interested when palaces, castles, and rebuilt old towns impress them less than they do their parents. Many of the activities listed below are in the capital, Warsaw, where there is simply a greater abundance of facilities.<n>To begin with the most obvious option, the Warsaw Zoo (ul. Ratuszowa 1-3, Tel. 619 40 41, <www.warszawa.um .gov.pl./zoo>) has been going strong since 1928. The habitats of some 4000 animals, including Siberian tigers, kangaroos, cheetahs, crocs, snow leopards, and an unusual red panda are spread across 40 hectares (99 acres). The zoo also has a free-flight bird hall. Another option in the capital for small children is the Baj Puppet Theater (ul. Jagiellonska 28, Tel. 818 08 21) housed in a former Jewish school in Praga, across the river from Old Town. Playgrounds — the kind with tunnels, jungle gyms, and inflatable cages filled with rubber balls — are found in the capital: Stratosfera (ul. Ostrobramska 75c, Tel. 611 35 83); Kolorado Ursynów (ul. Herbsta 4, Tel. 664 88 77).<n>For kids with energy to burn, there are water parks and swimming pools (see above) in summer and ice rinks in winter. To go ice skating, check out the Stegny Skating Track (Tor Lyzwiarski Stegny), (ul. Inspektowa 1, Tel. 842 27 68) or Torwar (ul. Lazienkowska, Tel. 621 44 71) in Warsaw. Another activity that is all the rage is paintball, and there are multiple fields where you can inflict paint rather than pain. Try Marcus-Graf (ul. Widok 10, in Beniaminów near Warsaw; Tel. 816 10 08), TM Pretor (ul. Zaaruskiego 6, Warsaw; Tel. 838 25 35), Rival Paintball Guns (ul. Bartosika 10/77, Warsaw; Tel. 671 22 63), or Extreme Sports (ul. Klaudyny 18/5, Warsaw; Tel. 833 73 73). Paintballers in Kraków should check out Ultimate Sports (near fort Bodzanów; Tel. 431 20 61).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Poland-WhatToDo.txt
With Portugal facing the Atlantic Ocean , rather than the Mediterranean Sea, it remained cut off from most trade routes. However, as the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century dominated the Mediterranean and shipbuilding technology improved, longer Atlantic journeys became a serious prospect. Peace with Spain in 1411 prompted Portugal to seek overseas conquests.<n>Prince Henry retired to what was known as the “end-of-the-world,” the Sagres peninsula in the Algarve (see page 101). There he established a school of navigation that attracted astronomers, cartographers, and other leading scientists of the day. Henry established expeditions that ultimately succeeded in redefining Europeans’ very understanding of the world. During Henry’s lifetime, Portuguese caravels sailed far beyond the westernmost point of Africa. With the colonization of Madeira and the Azores, the foundations were laid for the future Portuguese empire. The Portuguese also sailed down the west coast of Africa, going beyond Cape Bojador in 1434, a feat theretofore considered to be impossible.<n>Henry died in 1460, but Portugal’s discovery voyages continued. The king who ruled over the golden age of exploration — and exploitation — was Manuel I “The Fortunate,” who reigned from 1495–1521. The many important discoveries that were made during his reign would assure his position as Europe’s richest ruler: He could well afford to erect monuments as elegant as the Tower of Belém and as impressive as the Jerónimos Monastery in Lisbon.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-History.txt
Music<n>Music is the ingredient that keeps this island moving, and, whatever their age, Puerto Ricans cannot help but dance to any beat they hear. The popular rhythms are a unique mixture of Spanish and African influences, though the instruments traditionally used have antecedents going back further than the Spanish colonial and African slave imports. The güiro, a percussion instrument made of a notched dried gourd, was developed by the Taíno Indians. To this the Spanish added several types of guitars, with the ten-stringed cuatro being the most famous — it is the national instrument of Puerto Rico. African slaves brought with them the wherewithal to produce tambours, wood covered in animal skin to create drums, and maracas, dried gourds filled with seeds. These instruments played together form the basic “orchestra” for several popular musical genres.<n>Puerto Rican folk music is rich with songs based on real-life issues faced by the jíbaros, the ordinary country folk of the island — death, unrequited love, and poverty resulting from bad harvests. Salsa is probably the most famous form of music to emerge from Puerto Rico. Ironically, salsa (which means “sauce”) was imported back to the island from the Puerto Rican community who settled in New York city in the late 1940s. Salsa combines an array of percussion instruments with a swinging horn section. You will hear it everywhere. A much older “Latin” dance making a comeback is the merengue, which, when it first became popular, was considered to be so provocative that it was banned by the Spanish authorities.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhatToDo.txt
For “big-name” entertainment, your best bet may be an all-inclusive dinner-show-dancing ticket. Resident singers and comedians perform and a dance troupe struts its stuff before you take to the dance floor yourself.<n>During the high (winter) season and on any weekend, you must reserve seats for a show or a popular restaurant. The biggest night-on-the-town is “social Friday” (which begins after work on Friday evening and doesn’t end until breakfast time Saturday). If you’re going anywhere in San Juan by car on Friday night, allow at least a half-hour extra to negotiate the traffic.<n>Sports<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhatToDo.txt
South of Boquerón you leave the world behind. Make your way along Route 301 towards Cabo Rojo and the lighthouse at the southwest tip of the island to really enjoy natural Puerto Rico. Fishing is the main way people make a living here — between mangrove outcrops are many small shacks with boats tied up to rickety wooden jetties. The salt flats that you see are still harvested commercially. Eventually, the tarmac stops and the road changes to a simple dirt track. The surface is reasonable, so don’t worry about continuing on. You’ll travel over a narrow bridge and enter a section of the Bosque Estatal de Boquerón. Leave you car below the lighthouse and walk up the hill to reach it (a five-minute walk for the reasonably fit). Turn around as you climb the hill, and a wonderful sandy bay will open out in front of you. Pelicans play and feed, and frigate birds wheel in the sky above.<n>The Faro de Cabo Rojo (Cabo Rojo Lighthouse) has been sadly neglected, but the light still plays an important part in protecting shipping off the island. It sits atop some of the highest cliffs on Puerto Rico, a truly spectacular sight. But beware of going too close to the edge, as there are no fences here.<n>Inland from La Parguera and Boquerón is pretty San Germán, once also set on the coast but moved inland after the original site was sacked several times. Built on an undulating hillside, the town is the epitome of the Spanish colonial style. Its two town squares have not yet been spoiled by neon fast-food signs. There’s much of architectural interest around the pretty promenades and grand houses. Over 200 named buildings are under protection, but unfortunately, as yet, there is no tourist information office in the town, and many of the buildings are neither identified nor open to the public. Just enjoy the beautiful views and stroll along the streets to take in all the detail.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
You’ll find a more traditional nightlife, consisting of a weekly “dance” that takes place in an outdoor stadium or on a makeshift dance floor in smaller coastal towns such as Yelapa, Cruz de Loreto, and Barra de Navidad. Banda or ranchero-style music tends to dominate, but anything from hip-hop to classic rock may be tossed in for good measure.<n>Manzanillo, Ixtapa, and Zihuatanejo offer less in the way of nightlife. Manzanillo’s clubs are few, but crowded, and feature recorded music for dancing. The Latin music clubs get going around 10pm, and don’t even show up before midnight at the techno and alternative clubs. The majority of clubs, and the ubiquitous Carlos ‘n’ Charlie’s, are located along the main boulevard, Miguel de la Madrid. In Ixtapa, sunset happy hours offer the most options, and Mexican fiestas seem to be a “best bet” for a complete evening. Other later night offerings are a sampling of what you’ll find in any resort town in Mexico: Christine’s disco at the Krystal Hotel, Sr. Frogs, and Carlos ‘n’ Charlie’s. The only really original option here is the club, La Valentina, a combination restaurant/video bar with a desert-inspired décor.<n>There is no doubt that Acapulco rules when it comes to nightlife. In fact, I would venture that most visitors here come especially for that. Anyone that believes disco is dead hasn’t been to Acapulco — it’s alive and well, and happens nightly in an array of clubs that get going around midnight and often close after the sun comes up. The most majestic of these, Enigma, Palladium, and Fantasy, are located in the Las Brisas section of town, with towering, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking stunning views of Acapulco Bay in all its night-lit splendor.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt

These offer dancing under the stars with a view of the ocean. The crowd here is young — very young — and the general rule is that one cover charge entitles you to all you can drink. Special coupons are handed out aggressively on the beaches during the day, in hopes of luring the biggest crowd that night.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt
