Then they went on, they didn't make it to the house.<n>At about, about three weeks later, then arrived a group of about four, at my brother's house, and told him, that they were coming to, to be, that is to take control of the place, where we lived.<n>Well, but that they weren't going to steal, they weren't going to kill, neither would they harm the people, but it we didn't, if we worked with them.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_ArguetaBertila-ENG.txt

I didn't know anything about it until about the time, well, uh, I knew about it when they was running the clearance on me when I had a top secret, so I didn't know anything about what it was all about until I arrived.<n>I got orders to go to Del Rio, TX, so when I arrived out there, well, I found out I had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base.<n>I was reporting to a certain place in Del Rio, then I had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base, which had just re-opened.<n>	#face-to-face#	face-to-face_FrancisClem.txt
