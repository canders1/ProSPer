I'll produce that order, if necessary. [SEP] Well, let me share with you where I'm	coming	from, because I think what I've done here -- and obviously I can't do your job.	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	2
Do you recall a young man by the name of Max Pell speaking at that meeting? [SEP] Unfortunately I was in the restroom at the time that Max Pell was speaking because -- my husband told you I was eight months pregnant. I was actually nine months pregnant and due any day, so I spent quite a deal of time in the restroom. But I had excused myself to go to the restroom just after Barrie did this whole thing. In fact, I may have been walking out of the room at the time and in close proximity to her. And so at the time when Max was speaking -- I believe that there were people who spoke in between she and Max Pell. [SEP] But at the time when he stood to speak, I was in the restroom and sort of	coming	back from the restroom, so I don't really recall exactly what his comments were. [SEP] I know him because he was my husband's student, though. [SEP] Do you recall any other board members saying anything during the course of any discussion about the biology textbook?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	2
Do you recall any other board members saying anything during the course of any discussion about the biology textbook? [SEP] Well, like I said, I was reentering the room from the bathroom, so I was sort of in the doorway. [SEP] And I obviously didn't know what Max had said to the board but that he had spoken to the board. [SEP] So the comments that were	coming	back were, I assume, directed at him. [SEP] But there were comments from Bill Buckingham about brainwashing, and I remember hearing that, the whole thing about brainwashing, because it dealt with going to college and getting this education and students who go to college become brainwashed. [SEP] And I was very upset by that because I attended college and I don't feel as if I were brainwashed. [SEP] And also I recall Alan Bonsell making a comment about, you know, there are only two theories, there's this theory evolution and there's this theory creation, and if you're teaching only those two theories, then there's not a problem. [SEP] Do you recall anything else Mr. Bonsell said?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	2

Do you remember specifically anything he said? [SEP] Yes. [SEP] He made comments like, years ago someone died on the Cross, can't we take a stand for Him. [SEP] He made comments about the liberals in black robes	coming	and taking away our freedoms in the school. [SEP] He made many, many comments at that meeting. [SEP] Now, did you attend any other meetings of the Dover Area School District Board of Directors that summer?	#court_transcript#	court_transcript_Day3PMSession.txt	come	spoken	masc_spoken	2

Vice President Gore? [SEP] Yes, Jim. [SEP] I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength	coming	from what we stand for in the world. [SEP] I see it as a question of values. [SEP] It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be. [SEP] And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans. [SEP] It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us. [SEP] As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom. [SEP] So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union. [SEP	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	2
rketplaces. [SEP] But take Russia, for example. [SEP] We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. [SEP] The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. [SEP] They're going to have to make the decision themselves. [SEP] Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. [SEP] But Russia has to make the decision. [SEP] We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make. [SEP] So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is	coming	from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, we do it this way, so should you. [SEP] Now, we trust freedom. [SEP] We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans. [SEP] But maybe I misunderstand where you're	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	2
Is that right? [SEP] I'm not sure what kind of view he's describing to me. I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people. [SEP] I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't. [SEP] I'm not sure where he's	coming	from. [SEP] But I will be a tolerant person. [SEP] I've been a tolerant person all my life. [SEP] I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman. [SEP] Do you believe in general terms that gays and lesbians should have the same rights as other Americans?	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_2nd_Gore-Bush.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	2
But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices. [SEP] Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies	coming	out of your pockets. [SEP] That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums. [SEP] When I'm president, I'm sending that back to Congress and we're going to get a real prescription drug benefit.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	2
We're increasing the border security of the United States. [SEP] We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border. [SEP] We're using new equipment. [SEP] We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people	coming	across. [SEP] And we'll continue to do so over the next four years. [SEP] It's a subject I'm very familiar with. [SEP] After all, I was a border governor for a while.	#debate-transcript#	debate-transcript_3rd_Bush-Kerry.txt	come	written	masc_spoken	2

And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs. [SEP] That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. [SEP] It makes sure that the people	coming	across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families. [SEP] See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it. [SEP] It also means it takes pressure off the border.
