Sequels: 45734 “I trust you had a safe flight, dismal as the airline was?” [SEP] I nodded. [SEP] “How can you tell that?” “I could tell the moment you	walked	in. Not only was the dust on your shoes suggestive, but you smell faintly of jet fuel & inferior peanuts. That, & your boarding pass is sticking out of your pocket with the airline’s name facing out.” [SEP] I laughed.

“Hey.” [SEP] A girl, sixteen years old, with masses of bright red hair and big gray eyes opened the door. [SEP] She snapped her gum, leaning comfortably against the doorway. [SEP] Loud music sounded from inside. [SEP] “Hey, Beth.” [SEP] I	walked	up the pathway and into Beth’s mansion of a house, pulling at my camisole nervously. [SEP] Was I ever going to get over being around her? [SEP] I held in a sigh. [SEP] Probably not. [SEP] “Everyone’s downstairs. Get yourself a beer.” [SEP] Beth pointed down the stairs, to where the music was blasting from. [SEP] I strode over to the opening. [SEP] I looked back over my shoulder, seeing if she was coming, but Beth was already on the couch, absorbed with a cute junior. [SEP] I sighed, out loud this time.

[SEP] I watched him move the mouse, saving the document and then clicking on internet explorer. [SEP] I watched the screen switch to yahoo, and was silent as he sent whatever-it-was to himself. [SEP] I examined his face in silence. [SEP] There were deep bags beneath his eyes, and, as he turned to me, I could see how deeply worn he was from the lines on his face.

[SEP] I dragged her over to a ditch, and covered her with a piece of scrap plywood. [SEP] After dark I carried her to the cave. [SEP] The cave was the home of hundreds of rats.

[SEP] Now she seemed to have the beauty of a raven silently flying overhead, an ebony silhouette against the fire-red sky. [SEP] “Child,” she said again, “Why do you frown so? Are you not happy to be released after so many long years of imprisonment?” “Of course,” I said, but even as I said so my frown grew deeper. [SEP] I saw a fire in her black eyes.

[SEP] Two days before her 13th birthday, her parents, Dawn and Morning Tea, as she called her mother, took her to the Wayward Diviner, as was customary for children of the Days. [SEP] The Wayward Diviner had no doubt in his mind. [SEP] He told Alice’s parents who she was to be the heir of as soon as they	walked	through the door. [SEP] But they didn’t believe him.

Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still hadn’t come home. [SEP] I called Mitch and our other friends, hoping that she’d crashed at one of their houses, but I had no luck. [SEP] A couple of them remembered seeing her leave, but none of them had seen the thin man with her. [SEP] I didn’t know how they could miss such exotic features, even in that distorting light. [SEP] I caught a taxi back to the church. [SEP] It was still a mess, but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared. [SEP] I	walked	across what had been the dance floor. [SEP] The church was completely different now: sunlight fell through the stained glass, catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry, healthy warmth into the edges of the room, through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights. [SEP] I realized that Rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and I had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up – which, if she were in a situation where I should be doing something, would probably be never.

Walking out of the church, a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise. [SEP] A cold front must have hit while I was inside. [SEP] Glancing down the street, I realized that I didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time, and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran. [SEP] I pulled my T-shirt’s sleeves down my arms as far as they’d go, but I wasn’t ready for cold. [SEP] Walking didn’t build up much heat; it just moved the air enough to chill me more. [SEP] After I’d	walked	about a block, a car rolled up behind me. [SEP] It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry. [SEP] This wasn’t the best of neighborhoods. [SEP] I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it. [SEP] I heard an automatic window roll down. [SEP] “Hey,” said a male voice, “do you need some help?”	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	walk	written	masc_written	3
“I know your family. Get in. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and it’s best to start now.” [SEP] I	walked	around the car and got into the passenger seat. [SEP] Before I had my belt on, we were rolling forward. [SEP] “Okay,” I said. [SEP] “I’m in the car. Now, will you tell me how you know my family, and how you happened to be driving by just now? In fact, why didn’t you call me by name the first time? And how did you recognize me when – ” “That’s enough! I can only answer one question at a time. I know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours. I am here now because you called for help, and no-one else would answer.” [SEP] He turned onto the next street and shifted up. [SEP] “I will help you find your Rachel. I have to warn you, though, you won’t like what I have to tell you.”	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	walk	written	masc_written	3
bye to the hunchback as we left. [SEP] He gave me a half-hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing, and whether I should be wearing body armor. [SEP] Back on the street, I began to see things that I had never looked for until then. [SEP] Still in my initial shock, I suddenly noticed qualities of the people that my mind hadn’t registered when we parked. [SEP] I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through – people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them, and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail. [SEP] The yellow of this sky wasn’t just smog: it had a leeching, heavy dimness. [SEP] I saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light. [SEP] A corpulent, batrachian woman	walked	along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle. [SEP] Leaning from the rough-hewn window of one building on our right was something with long, green hair draped across the seven gangly arms hanging from its windowsill. [SEP] Thirty-five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed. [SEP] I noticed when my back hit the wall that I was walking backwards. [SEP] “We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,” said my driver. [SEP] I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills.

[SEP] “Don’t let the sun fool you. Then I’m going to shed a little blood, but don’t worry, none of yours.” [SEP] I blinked at him, but he just kept walking until we reached the corner. [SEP] “Okay, you might feel silly, but just turn three times to your left. Try to keep in time with me.” [SEP] We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust. [SEP] The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back. [SEP] When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner. [SEP] Nepthys	walked	towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening the door. [SEP] “Are you coming?” [SEP] We slipped through the door and came out, not inside the building, but on a busy street in a completely different part of town. [SEP] The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East. [SEP] Nepthys took us immediately to the right, where he led us to a cart filled with herbs. [SEP] Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn’t place. [SEP] The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar.

Step behind the cart and enter through the door there, using your left hand to open the door and your right – ” he looked at me “ – to close it.” “Thank you.” [SEP] Nepthys bowed slightly and we	walked	behind the cart. [SEP] The latch opened under Nepthys’ left hand with a clack! [SEP] The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs. [SEP] At the top was one door.

[SEP] “Come on, Amy,” I said, “he’ll be along soon.” [SEP] Nepthys caught up with us after a minute and	walked	silently to the end of the hall. [SEP] When we got there, another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood. [SEP] He offered it to Nepthys, who opened the box: on velvet lining, a wooden hammer and two stakes. [SEP] “Mountain ash,” said Nepthys. [SEP] “That was very kind of her.” [SEP] Closing the box, he paused beside the open door and looked back at me. [SEP] “I really hope we find your Rachel,” he said.

[SEP] Some quarter-mile from Arthur's gate, he halted, confronted by a halloo. [SEP] "Nathan?" he called out to the empty road. [SEP] The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree. [SEP] "I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today," said Nathan, "so I thought I'd wait here for you." [SEP] Nathan's lanky frame, dressed in a loose, tan jacket, fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton. [SEP] His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface, infusing his body with a rakish energy.

My dear friend, you have done it. Oh, they may rail against you at first; they may decry you as a heathen or a literary savage; but while those in power say such things, others will read your tales and see their true worth. Believe me when I say that you will be read a century from now." [SEP] Allan, though dubious as to that possibility, felt some temptation from the compliment; mainly, it granted him the encouragement he still needed. [SEP] Nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and Allan left it with him, then	walked	home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face. [SEP] He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right; although the man was somewhat peculiar, he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight.
