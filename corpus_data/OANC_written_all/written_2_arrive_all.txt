Significantly, it was in several of these [labor-intensive] more fragmented industries—textiles, apparel, furniture, and some food processing—that the mass retailer (the department stores, mail-order houses and chain stores) began to coordinate the flow of goods from manufacturer to consumer. In those industries where substantial economies of scale and scope did not exist in production, high-volume flows through the processes of production and distribution came to be guided—and the resulting cost reductions achieved—by the buying departments of mass retailers, retailers who handled a variety of related products through their facilities.43<n>And so we arrive at the new information technologies of the 1980s. These have begun to create integrated channels among enterprises in the three industries, facilitating even more product proliferation and stimulating changes in merchandising, inventory management, internal production practices, and methods of using human resources. When it comes to the driving force behind the late twentieth-century industrial transformation, lean retailing is at the forefront of that revolution.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch2.txt
Then along came lean retailing and the need for rapid replenishment—manufacturers are now expected to replenish products in less than a week. At first, only a few retailers required this, and apparel manufacturers tried to meet these needs with minimal changes in their internal practices. Often, this was done at the expense of a manufacturer’s non-lean retail customers. For example, the CEO of a men’s dress-shirt supplier reported to us in 1992 that its finished goods warehouse was divided into two areas. A locked section contained finished goods reserved for orders from Dillard’s, Inc., this manufacturer’s biggest customer and its only one with stringent rapid-replenishment requirements. The rest of the warehouse held inventory for all other retailers. If the locked section had insufficient inventory for a Dillard’s order, product from the rest of the warehouse could be picked and sent to Dillard’s, but no retailers could receive products from the locked section reserved for Dillard’s, no matter how severe their needs. This arrangement worked well from Dillard’s perspective; it found this firm to be one of its best rapid-replenishment suppliers, with high order-fulfillment rates and on-time deliveries—the main criteria for success. For the manufacturer, it meant a larger finished goods inventory and worse service for its other customers.<n>As long as only one or two retailers required rapid replenishment, manufacturers could get away with this type of solution. But it didn’t take long before most retailers wanted orders for basic apparel items replenished this way and they became very demanding. As an increasing number of suppliers are dancing to the demands of rapid replenishment, they are finding it a complex tune. Manufacturers suddenly have much more to do than just make clothing—they are being asked to do work previously done by the retailer, such as picking and packing the order for each store from the retailer’s warehouse. Each store’s order has to be put in a separate carton, labeled with its own bar code, and accompanied by an advance shipping notice. Moreover, retailers want an order to arrive at their distribution center at an exact time. If the truck is late, the driver often has to wait until the end of the day to unload, if allowed to do so at all. Deliveries made a day late are sometimes refused and sent back.<n>Such retail requirements have certainly put substantial pressure on apparel manufacturers to change their own practices. Chapter 5 described some of the basic changes many manufacturers are making to stay in the game with lean retailers. But even if lean retailing has led to suppliers’ wide-scale adoption of bar codes and EDI-related capabilities, divergent production strategies among suppliers have emerged. Conceivably, two business units could each meet the same lean retailing requirements yet have very different internal practices and performance. One could raise finished goods inventories substantially (like the dress-shirt manufacturer described above); the other could make crucial operational changes to reduce manufacturing lead times. However, in light of the growth of rapid replenishment, our research predicts that the performance of these two units will vary over time, with the supplier that has implemented flexible planning and short-cycle production processes coming out ahead. By investing in these practices, apparel suppliers have the potential to satisfy lean retailing performance standards without bearing the costs of greatly expanded inventory in their own operations. From our standpoint, holding high inventories to meet rapid replenishment demands is strictly a short-term strategy for manufacturers.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt
The vast majority of workers in the apparel industry are involved in assembly. This is illustrated in Table 9.1 (page 158) for the men’s and boys’ shirt industry. In 1990, 73 percent of all workers in this industry were classified as working in the sewing department; 91 percent were sewing machine operators. Given the predominant share of workers in assembly, organization of work in the sewing room has been the central focus of management attention.<n>The sewing rooms of most apparel factories are similar in overall appearance. Apparel parts, trim pieces, buttons, zippers, and thread arrive at one end of the room and are separated for each operation, or subassembly. As the last chapter noted, large apparel firms usually operate a central cutting room that provides cut parts to an average of five sewing plants.9 About two-thirds of the production volume of our surveyed business units did their marker-making, spreading, and cutting in a single location. Most would deliver cut goods to sewing plants many times a week; however, when cutting is done hundreds of miles from the sewing plants, weekly deliveries are the norm. Trucks take fresh parts to the plants and return with finished goods for the distribution center.<n>Sewing rooms are generally arranged in rows of workers, each seated at a machine doing one operation on a bundle of parts. Traditionally, the progressive bundle system assumed that maximum worker productivity could be achieved by breaking down the steps of assembly into a series of discrete operations. Each sewing operator would be trained in the correct approach to one specific task. Through repetition of the task and coaching by experts, the operator would become very productive. Although new work practices are evolving in the apparel industry, many workers still specialize in one operation or at most two. In fact, long product runs in men’s and unisex product lines, such as jeans, have made U.S. sewing operators extremely efficient.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
It is not clear when low riding started, but it was already a custom by the 1930s in Los Angeles and Sacramento, although the name “low rider” did not come into usage until the 1960s. After World War II, because of the growth in the economy, many Chicanos could afford to buy cars, old and new, and the practice of customizing cars and cruising became very popular throughout the Southwest and California during the 1950s. The most popular cars to lower are long ones, such as Fords, Buicks, and Chevrolets. Hydraulic lifts are used to lower and raise both the front and rear ends of a car. Before it was discovered that a hydraulic lift could be used with the batteries stored in the trunk of the car, different methods were used to lower the chassis of the car. Early crude methods were to place heavy bricks and cement bags in the trunk, or to cut the spring’s coils, or lower the car’s blocks. To give the car that lowered look the top might be cut back to lower the roof. In recent times, once a car is “lifted” or “all juiced up,” the driver controls the lift with a hand control.<n>The painting and decorating of the exterior and interior of the car are very important for appearances, personal identity, and also for belonging to a car club and participating in car shows. The interior may be upholstered in crushed velvet, red or black, have wall-to-wall carpeting, a bar, a chandelier, a TV, and a stereo tape deck. The exterior may be painted in two tones, a lacquer mixed with iridescent flakes, or have a pearl finish. Sometimes the undercarriage is chromed and gold-plated. Painting low-rider cars is a specialty only available at certain paint and body shops, so low riders must be aware of such businesses. Besides the painting of the car, other decorative designs or motifs may also be applied, such as pinstriping, fancy lace (a fire design), and murals. Murals of an Aztec or Mayan scene or La Virgen de Guadalupe are popular icons painted on the trunk, hood, or roof of the car. Even though there is similarity in the styles, each car is very different in the final production. There are many techniques employed to arrive at a unique personal style. For instance accessories from different-year models are interchanged, such as side panels from a 1957 model may be cut and welded to a 1952 car, or “’57 Cadillac tail lamps on a ’62 Chevy Impala” (Bright, 196).<n>Low riders are usually young urban Chicanos, between the ages of eighteen and thirty, and there can be two and three generations of low riders in one family. The cost of fixing and maintaining a low-rider car is fairly high, so the owner typically is a working person. Since finding older cars, say from the 1950s, is becoming difficult, some low riders now customize small trucks, motorcycles, and bicycles as well. The movie Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life) depicts the work that goes into customizing a pickup truck.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
From the Spanish word nacer, nacimiento is the name for a Christmas nativity scene. In the Southwest the creation of nacimientos has been a tradition since the seventeenth century. A nacimiento may resemble a religious altar in that it is an assemblage of many articles and objects, all depicting the recent birth of Jesus Christ in the manger, but a nacimiento can also include other Christmas-related images, biblical scenes, and possibly artifacts relating to the life experiences of the creator. The set of the nacimiento can vary in size from a small table to half a room, or to the whole front yard of a home. Outdoor nacimientos will have life-size figures of Mary and Joseph and various other biblical characters and animals. This custom is not particular to the Chicano community, and nativity scenes can be found throughout the country during the Christmas season. It is thought that Saint Francis of Assisi is the saint responsible for much of the veneration of the infant Jesus, and the custom of creating nativity scenes or monuments to the birth of Christ has been going on for hundreds of years.<n>In private homes nacimientos are usually set up for the first night of Las Posadas, which starts on December 16 and continues until December 24. A nacimiento is left in place until El Día de los Reyes, Epiphany, on January 6, when the three kings arrive to visit the Christ child.<n>See also Las Posadas<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chN.txt
Las Posadas (Christmas Pageant)<n>A tradition marking the beginning of the Christmas season with the dramatization of the search for lodging in Bethlehem by Joseph and Mary. It always includes a procession with singing and music and starts nine days before Christmas. The story, in the form of a novena (Catholic nine-days devotion), is based on the gospel of St. Luke. For nine consecutive nights before Christmas Eve, la Noche Buena (the good night), los peregrinos (the pilgrims) representing Joseph and Mary visit a different home each night, reenacting the search for an inn by Joseph and Mary. Los mesoneros, those who portray the innkeepers, keep refusing them lodging. Los peregrinos form a procession, and children and angels hand-carry the small figures of the Holy Family. When they arrive at a home they ask for shelter and sing carols. Las Posadas occurs from December 16 through December 24. Nine different homes are opened to the pilgrims and food and drink are offered after the peregrinos have been denied lodging. Most homes will have a nativity scene, a nacimiento, set up for the prayers and singers. An important tradition of these festivities is the piñata that is brought out and broken by the children. There is evidence that piñatas originated from this Christmas celebration.<n>Posadas are still held today in many Mexican communities in the United States. Some are organized by church groups, but recently others have been organized for commercial purposes by city entities. The reenactment of Las Posadas is an ancient tradition that can be traced back to the early conquest in Mexico and to the christianization of the Aztecs by the Augustine priests. They originated in the small village of San Augustin Acolman located near the pyramids in Teotihuacán. The Aztecs celebrated the birth of their god Huitzilopochtli for one night, and celebrations were held all of the following day in every home. This occurred about the same time of the year that the Catholic Church celebrated the birth of Christ. The Augustine priests saw the similarity between these Aztec celebrations and the Christmas festivities and chose this opportunity to teach the new religion to the Aztecs. While the Aztecs were celebrating the birth of Huitzilopochtli, the priests reenacted the pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph. The nine nightly journeys symbolize the nine months of pregnancy for Mary. These Christmas Masses, as they were called, were celebrated in the convents and churches, but eventually were moved to the haciendas, farms, and ranches, and finally to the neighborhoods. The celebrations ended with firecrackers and the breaking of a piñata. Today many cities in the Southwest reenact this pilgrimage for one night with a procession winding through city streets. In Monterey, California, the whole city comes out for Las Posadas, and in San Antonio, Texas, a posada is held during the Fiesta de las Luminarias (Festival of the Bonfires) that includes a procession on the Paso del Rio (river pass).<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt
Before turning to the huge diculties of quantum gravity, we should review the fundamental mystery of quantum mechanics. Most readers are familiar with the famous two-slit experiment, which exhibits the fundamental oddness of quantum interference. Feynman, in his famous three-volume lectures on physics, gives the mystery as simply as possible: We begin with a gun shooting bullets. The bullets pass through one of two holes in a metal plate and fly further on, landing on a flat layer of sand in a box. Bullets passing through either hole may be deflected slightly by hitting the walls of the hole. Thus, in the sandbox behind the metal plate, we would expect, and actually would find, two mounds of bullets. Each mound would be centered on the line of flight of the bullet from the gun through the corresponding hole to the sandbox, with a “Gaussian” or normal bell-shaped distribution of bullet densities falling away from the peak of each mound.<n>When we use monochromatic light rather than bullets, we note the following: If the light hits the sandbox, changed into a photon-counter surface, we find that the size of the energetic impact is the same each time a photon hits the surface. Photons of a given wavelength have a fixed energy. A photon either is recorded at a point on the surface or not. Whenever one is recorded, the full parcel of energy has been detected at the surface. Now if only one hole is open, one gets the Gaussian mound result. Most photons pass through the hole unscathed and arrive in a straight line at the photon-counter surface. A Gaussian distribution peaked at that center is present because some photons are deflected slightly by the edges of the hole.<n>But if two holes are open, then one gets the famous interference pattern of light and dark interfering circles spreading from the centers on the photon-counter surface that were the peaks of the mounds seen when hole or hole was open. Of course, as Feynman points out, there is no way to account for this oddness in classical physics.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt
But there is an alternative approach to the link between the quantum and the classical worlds. This possible approach is based on the well-established phenomenon of “decoherence.” Decoherence arises when a quantum-coherent Schrödinger wave is propagating and the quantum system interacts with another quantum system having many coupled variables, or degrees of freedom. The consequence can be that the Schrödinger wave function of the first quantum system becomes entangled in very complex ways with the other complex quantum system, which may be thought of as the environment. Rather like water waves swirling into tiny granular nooks and crannies along a rugged fractal beach, the initial coherent Schrödinger equation representing the initial quantum system swirls into tiny and highly diverse patterns of interaction with the quantum system representing the environment. The consequence of this intermixing is decoherence.<n>To understand the core of decoherence, one must understand that the exhibition of interference phenomena, the hallmark of quantum mechanics noted in the double-slit photon experiment, requires that literally all the propagating possible pathways in Feynman’s sum over histories that are to arrive at each point on the photon-counter surface, do in fact arrive at that point. If some fail to arrive, the sum over all histories fails. In eect, if some of the phase information, the core of constructive and destructive interference, has been lost in the maze of interactions of the quantum system with its environment, then that phase information cannot come to be reassembled to give rise to quantum interference.<n>Decoherence is accepted by most physicists. For example, in attempts to build quantum computers that can carry out more than one calculation simultaneously due to the linear features of quantum mechanics, actual decoherence is currently a technical hurdle in obtaining complex quantum calculations.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt
There is a weaker sense of reductionism, namely the casting of an account of a higher-level object, concept, or phenomenon in terms of a suYcient, but not necessary and suYcient, set of conditions at a lower level. In this sense, statistical mechanics surely does “account for” classical mechanics. Many argue that this weaker sense of reductionism suYces. Well, suYces for what? That is a bit harder to be clear about. Roughly, the temptation is to say, “Temperature is nothing but the average kinetic energy of the atoms in the system”; that is, we appear to reduce the ontological furniture of the universe.<n>I suspect that this familiar ontological move is not always warranted. Let’s take some cases that Phil Anderson uses to exemplify “emergence.” Gold is a yellow, malleable metal familiar to all of us. Nowhere in the quantum mechanical description of atomic gold are these macroscopic properties to be found. Moreover, there is no deductive way to arrive at these macroscopic collective properties from the underlying quantum mechanics of atoms of gold. Rather, we observe the macroscopic properties, find lawful features of those properties, then attempt to link them to suYcient conditions in our quantum mechanical description of matter.<n>Another class of cases Anderson refers to is broken symmetries. A familiar example would be a pole standing vertically on an horizontal slab on the earth’s surface. The vertical pole is unstable in the face of gravity and will soon fall. It might fall and point in any direction. Hence, the system has the full symmetry of the plane prior to the falling of the pole. In due course, the pole does fall over and points in some specific direction. Thereby, the symmetry of the system prior to falling has been broken. We cannot deduce from the symmetry of the initial state how that symmetry will be broken.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt

Although only a small square, and cut by so many tramlines that it is difficult to know which way to look, it has a very beautiful tower — Muntorren (Mint Tower). Originally a medieval gate guarding the entrance to the city, it was damaged by fire in 1619, and the clock tower was added by de Keyser during the renovations of 1620. In 1699 the carillon was installed and this still fills the air with its regular bell rounds. During the war with France in 1672, when Amsterdam had its supply of money cut off, the tower was transformed for a short time into the city mint, and the name has remained since that time.<n>In the shadow of the tower, and floating on the Singel canal (the medieval protective moat for the city) is the Bloemenmarkt (Flower market). The daily market has been held for centuries, when the flower sellers would arrive by canal with boats laden with blooms. Today the stalls still float on the water but are permanently attached to the canal wall. The blooms they sell bring a splash of color to even the dullest Amsterdam day.<n>Stroll along the market until you reach Konigsplein and take a left down Leidsestraat. This is a major shopping street and one of the busiest because it links one of the largest squares in the city to the central area.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Immediately as you enter the compound you can get a bird’s-eye view of Grave Circle A, where the Royal grave shafts were found, and then climb to the top of the settlement to view the remains of the Royal Palace. From here the views of the surrounding rolling countryside are magnificent.<n>Half a mile below the city is an immense Beehive tomb cut into the hillside and lined with stone blocks. The acoustics inside the tomb are very precise, exaggerating the sound of your approaching fellow visitors. If a party of schoolchildren arrive to test out the tomb, it may be a good idea to beat a hasty retreat for the sake of your ears!<n>Further east from Mycenae is another ancient site also renowned for its acoustics. The Theater of Epidauros (Epidavros), was built in the fourth century b.c. and could hold an audience of 12,000 people. Live performances still take place here every summer. The theater does not sit in splendid isolation but was part of a large settlement based around the Sanctuary of Asklepios — one of the most important centers of healing in the ancient world. Today there is little left of the site and it is difficult to imagine hospitals, spas, and faith-healing practices catering to travelers from across the Greek world.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
Seashells and sponges can be found in every market and souvenir shop in the Bahamas. They make beautiful, natural souvenirs, but some may come from protected species. Do not buy coral or turtle products as this is illegal and only encourages further damage to these delicate and rare forms of sea life.<n>Clothing. If you like, you could take an empty bag and buy your holiday wardrobe when you arrive in the Bahamas. Many of the shops on Bay Street, at the International Bazaar, and the Port Lucaya Market Place offer beachwear and T-shirts galore. Sarongs, printed dresses, and shirts in light fabrics are sold in almost every craft stall in the straw markets. Light-cotton Androsia clothing, made on Andros, is perfect for the Bahamian climate; you’ll find these items all over the Bahamas.<n>Straw hats, which will protect you from the strong sun and save you from a wrinkle or two, are abundant and inexpensive. You’ll be able to choose from styles ranging from the understated to the extremely flamboyant.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhatToDo.txt
The Mountains<n>To the Balinese, the mountains are the abode of the gods, the source of the rivers that water their crops, and of occasional outbursts of destructive fury. The highest of them are active or dormant volcanoes: Gunung Batur simmers more or less continuously while Gunung Agung erupts violently once every few hundred years. When you set out for the higher altitudes, be prepared for cold with damp mists, or for scorching sunshine.Either condition is possible. Many tour companies run day trips, sometimes combining visits to Besakih (see page 60) and Penelokan (see page 58). This is an easy way to see the views, but you will arrive at the same time as hundreds of others. With more and more accommodations opening, think about overnighting at a mountain resort, or an inexpensive guest house. If you plan to climb one of the peaks — not a mountaineering feat but a few hours’ or a full day’s hill walking and scrambling over rocks — it’s essential to stay nearby and start early.<n>Bangli<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Bali’s highest peak, at 3,142 m (10,309 ft), is also its holiest. Still active today, the volcano erupted in 1963 (see page 23) and poured red-hot lava down its slopes, setting villages ablaze. Ash covered much of northern Bali, ruining crops, blocking up the rivers, and causing mudslides that took many lives.<n>Besakih, known as Bali’s “mother temple,” stands high up on the southwestern slopes of the mountain. From a distance you’ll see a forest of black thatched, pagoda-like meru roofs rising in tiers above the rice terraces, with the volcano as a backdrop. This was probably even a holy place in the pre-Hindu era. During more than a thousand years it has evolved into a complex of nearly 200 temples and shrines. The most important group stands in the middle, representing the three manifestations of God: Brahma (right, with great red banners), Shiva (center, with big white banners), and Vishnu (left, with large black banners). Most tour buses arrive at mid-morning and mid-afternoon, but no matter when you visit, you will be harassed by hawkers, goaded by guides, and ordered by gatekeepers to make donations. Local people don’t see this commercial activity as inappropriate; to them, a temple isn’t a holy place until the gods are present, and that only happens during a religious ceremony.<n>There are also guides offering their services to those who want to climb Gunung Agung; only the fit and well-prepared should attempt it, and only in the dry season. Even then, the expedition can take as long as twelve hours and involves a lot of slipping and sliding on stony slopes.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Ampenan, Mataram, and Cakranegara<n>Flights land at Selaparang Airport, on the northern outskirts of Lombok’s provincial capital, Mataram. The ferries from Bali dock at Lembar, 10 km (6 miles) to the south. One of the most pleasant, exotic ways to arrive in Lombok is on the Bounty and Mabua Express ferries. Faster and more comfortable (and more expensive) than the older ferries from Padangbai, these leave Bali from Benoa Harbor and arrive at Bangsal, close to the Gilli Islands. Small craft take you from the ferries to the beach at Bangsal or to the Gilli Islands, avoiding the grungy port at Lembar, and introducing you immediately to the more idyllic parts of Lombok.<n>Not so long ago, the old port of Ampenan, the administrative center of Mataram, and the commercial district of Cakranegara were completely separate. Now they have joined up in an urban sprawl, home to a quarter of a million people. A long, broad avenue lined by an improbable number of government buildings links them all and then continues to Sweta, the island’s transport hub.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
BARCELONA FOR CHILDREN<n>Barcelona is an excellent city for children. Besides the city beaches, the Port Vell waterfront has L’Aquàrium, the largest aquarium in Europe (along the Moll d’Espanya; Tel. 93/221 74 74), a 3-D Imax movie theater (Tel. 902/33 22 11), and lots of adolescent diversions in the Maremagnum mall—even getting there, crossing the wooden drawbridge Rambla del Mar, is fun. The Zoo (Parc Zoológic, on Ciutadella Park, Tel. 93/221 25 06), has the world’s only albino gorilla in captivity. Poble Espanyol (Avda. del Marqués de Comillas, on Montjuïc), a re-creation of a Spanish village with architectural styles from all over Spain, is very popular with families. The amusement parks on both Montjuïc and Tibidabo (Parc d’Atraccions) are very entertaining, and kids love to arrive at the former via aerial cable car (see page 69).<n>In terms of traditional sightseeing, both La Rambla, with its squawking birds and brilliantly attired mimes, and Parc Guëll, Gaudí’s playground for children of all ages, prove very diverting (see pages 57).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt
St. George’s Harbour and Penno’s Wharf were working at full capacity to unload cargoes that were then transferred onto blockade-runners. These long, slim vessels were specially designed to outrun the Union navy’s picket ships. They made their way to Wilmington, North Carolina, the closest Confederate port to Bermuda. Here they would take on a new cargo of cotton — a most profitable ballast that increased in value tenfold by the time it was delivered to buyers in Britain. St. George’s boomed during the Civil War; the town seethed with sailors, speculators, Confederate agents, and Union spies. When General Lee laid down his sword in 1865, it was as if Bermuda, too, had lost a war.<n>In the years that followed, Bermuda’s fortunes picked up as the first steamships began to arrive on a regular basis. In 1883 Princess Louise (daughter of Queen Victoria) arrived on a lengthy visit en route to her new home farther north, as the wife of the Governor General of Canada. She extolled Bermuda to those in her upper-class English circles, and wealthy tourists began to arrive soon thereafter. By the turn of the century, Bermuda was a well-known winter destination for visitors from the US and Canada as well as Britain. The Princess Hotel was opened in Hamilton in 1885 to commemorate the visit.<n>Three More Wars<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-history.txt
The game of cricket is Bermuda’s life blood, and the Cup Match is the premier sporting — and social — event of the year. The whole island is in a holiday mood when the event is held in late July or early August, and most shops and many restaurants close. Everyone’s attention focuses on enjoying the day. You are not just watching the match; you are watching a society at play.<n>Bermuda’s maritime heritage can be seen most clearly in the many regattas and ocean races held during the summer. Local Bermuda dinghies, with white sails unfurled, cut through the azure waters. Large sleek sailboats ply the Atlantic from the US in an ocean-going race at least once each year, and there is nothing quite like watching these beautiful vessels arrive in harbor (see page 95). Large crowds gather in Hamilton to welcome winner and losers alike.<n>There are also frequent golf, tennis, and rugby tournaments. Road races, carting, fun runs, triathlons, and marathons are all regular activities, and many of Bermuda’s sporting associations hold invitationals or open tournaments. If you have a special sporting interest, it would be worthwhile contacting the Bermuda Department of Tourism for specific information.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhatToDo.txt
Bermuda is not a duty-free island. In fact, since there is no income tax for the local population, charging duty on imported goods is one way for the government to raise funds. Duty varies on the type of goods but is always included in the price. However, there is no sales tax at all in Bermuda, so here is your opportunity to save a little.<n>Tax-free shops will claim to save you up to 30 percent on prices back home, but this is not universal. It is always important to do some research at home before you arrive so that you can compare prices. Some goods are only a little cheaper in Bermuda, but you might want a “real” bargain.<n>In many ways, Bermuda is still a vendor of fine British goods, although the range of merchandise is definitely expanding. Bermudian traders have always bought directly from the manufacturers rather than through middlemen, which has traditionally resulted in a cheaper price than you would find at home. However, government-imposed import duty means that prices might not be as advantageous as they once were. The key to tax-free shopping in Bermuda today is quality, not price.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhatToDo.txt
Clothing<n>If you don’t feel like packing for Bermuda, take an empty bag and buy your holiday wardrobe when you arrive in the islands. The Front Street department stores in Hamilton have a full range of fashion items from Europe, and there are many independent boutiques with ready-to-wear collections. And as in any other tourist destination, there are plenty of shops selling beachwear and T-shirts galore.<n>Collectibles<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhatToDo.txt
The American Pioneers<n>The first Americans to come to California from the eastern states were Boston fur traders taking the Cape Horn route at the end of the 18th century. They didn’t stay for long, but gradually other traders and fur trappers began to arrive overland through Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, settling only in small numbers until the famous covered wagons began their heroic treks of the 1840s. The hardships the pioneers suffered in the Sierra Nevada mountains, Death Valley, and the Mojave Desert became the stuff of California legend, the most tragic being the fate of 87 pioneers who set out from Illinois in 1846. While attempting to cross the Sierra Nevada, George Donner’s wagon train became snowed in, and from November until February was stuck high in the mountains north of Lake Tahoe, at a point now known as the Donner Pass. Just 47 people survived, and then only by resorting to cannibalism.<n>Just simple farmers seeking a place in the sun to work a piece of land, the pioneers came at a time when territorial expansion was much in vogue — the French in the Pacific and Algeria, the British in Africa and the Far East. The United States was eager to get in on the act and so, during the war with Mexico over the annexation of Texas, California was suddenly regarded as a useful addition to the spoils. United States forces captured Los Angeles in 1847, and the Mexicans capitulated at Cahuenga. A treaty of American annexation of California was signed on 2 February 1848. Meanwhile, unknown to the American and Mexican signatories, gold had been found in the Sierra Nevada foothills only nine days earlier.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-History.txt
If you’re heading west from downtown, avoid the freeway and follow another great thoroughfare, Wilshire Boulevard. Once an Indian trail, in its heyday this 16-mile (25-km) roadway glittered with the prosperity of its department stores and luxury hotels. A living museum of the Art Deco architecture that characterized Los Angeles’s rise to greatness during the 1920s and 1930s, the section of Wilshire between La Brea and Fairfax avenues, known as the “miracle mile,” is slowly being renovated after years of neglect. Notable buildings include the former Bullocks Wilshire department store standing at the corner of Kingsley, and the Franklin Life Insurance building situated at Van Ness and Wilshire.<n>The primary reason to cruise along Wilshire is to arrive at Hancock Park, home of the famous La Brea Tar Pits. Here petroleum deposits ooze through fractures to the surface and evaporate, leaving natural tar lakes (brea is Spanish for “tar”). From viewing stations, visitors may observe the excavation of fossilized remains. The adjacent George C. Page Museum (5801 Wilshire Boulevard) has on display the skeletons of mammoths, mastodons, saber-toothed tigers, and other unfortunate creatures who became trapped in the sticky tar during the last Ice Age.<n>Next door to the tar pits is the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), whose provocative modern architecture houses one of the state’s best art collections, including outstanding examples of Nepalese, Indian, and Tibetan art, Japanese scroll paintings, pre-Columbian art, and German Expressionist drawings. Other highlights include important works by Rembrandt, Dürer, Frans Hals, Picasso, and the Impressionists.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
The older hotels continue to make improvements to keep up with the megaresorts — Circus Circus built Grand Slam Canyon, a family theme park sheltered within a climate-controlled pink glass dome. Most hotels offer family amenities and shows, many of them first-class (although kids are never allowed to loiter in the casinos). Any show by Cirque du Soleil (at Treasure Island or Bellagio) is worth seeing — this international troupe of performers reaches mystical heights.<n>If it’s the traditional Las Vegas you dream of, the best time to arrive is at sunset, when the city lights loom out of the desert darkness. For the same reason, nighttime is the best time to roam along The Strip, when the lights are brightest and the tables at their liveliest. Apart from the décor, the casinos are pretty much alike — admission is free, and they’re open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. There are one-armed bandits (slot machines) near the doors, the delights of roulette, blackjack, craps, and Keno further in, and everywhere huge television screens showing horse-racing and other big sporting events from all over the country. For the bewildered, there are free booklets explaining how best to lose your money at the various tables, and free blackjack lessons in the afternoons. You will notice there are no clocks or windows in the casinos — the management wants you to lose track of time.<n>There are also alternatives to gambling — the big casinos offer live stage shows with all kinds of entertainment, from major singing stars to leggy extravaganzas like the Folies Bergères to world-title boxing matches. If you want to get out and about, there are opportunities for almost every type of recreation activity, including winter sports, within an hour of the city.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
The first foreign visitors to the Canaries are thought to have been Arab sailors who landed on Gran Canaria some 2,000 years ago and were met warmly. In later centuries the islanders’ gracious hospitality was to cost them dearly.<n>Europeans did not arrive until the 14th century, when the Genoese sailor Lanzarotto Marcello colonized the island, known then in native tongue as Tytheroygatra and subsequently as Lanzarote. Slave traders, treasure seekers, and missionaries all followed in Lanzarotto’s wake, but it was not until 1402 that the European conquest of the Canaries began in earnest. At its helm was the Norman baron, Jean de Béthencourt, under service to Henry III, king of Castile. After the baron had taken Lanzarote and Fuerteventura with comparative ease, his ships were scattered by storms off Gran Canaria. He next turned to El Hierro, where the awestruck islanders welcomed the new visitors arriving in their great floating vessels as gods. Béthencourt returned the hospitality by inviting the natives aboard his ships. He then took them captive and sold them into slavery.<n>Around this time the Portuguese, who had also been colonizing the Atlantic, turned their attention to the Canaries. Naval skirmishes ensued between the two powers, but at the end of the war of succession between Portugal and Castile, the wide-ranging Treaty of Alcaçovas ended Lisbon’s claims to the Fortunate Islands.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-History.txt
In the Wake of Cortés<n>The first recorded Europeans to arrive in the Yucatán, in 1511, were doubly unfortunate: a group of Spanish sailors survived a shipwreck on the coast of what is now Quintana Roo, only to be sacrificed by the Mayan natives. However, two were allowed to live as slaves and one, Gonzalo Guerrero, went native and married the chief’s daughter. His children were the first mestizos — the people of mixed Indian and Spanish blood who now make up 55 percent of the Mexican population.<n>In 1517, an expedition led by Francisco Hernandez de Cordobá landed on the west coast of the Yucatán, near Campeche, but were beaten back by a hail of arrows from the hostile natives. However, the following year, ambitious, young Captain Juan de Grijalva discovered the island of Cozumel and skirted the coast of the peninsula, hearing tales from the Indians of the great civilization of the Aztecs. Here, they told him, you can find a city made of gold.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-History.txt
The Spanish conducted the first Catholic mass in Mexico here after their arrival in 1518, but they had little interest in the island. It remained almost uninhabited through the 18th century. But following the War of the Castes in 1847–1848, several rebel families settled here to escape retribution by colonial landowners on the Yucatecan mainland. They eked out a simple living for decades until the invention of the scuba tank. And the rest, as they say, is history!<n>Cozumel has multiple personalities; it caters to divers who go to bed early and rise with the sun, yet it also has occasionally raucous nightlife for those who want to stay out and party. Those who know the island well refer to this phenomenon as the “wet” side and the “dry” side. Day-trippers who arrive on their huge floating cruise ships — or on daily ferries from Playa del Carmen — add an extra dimension; they want to see everything in a few hours, so the slow routine of island life speeds up when they arrive.<n>There is only one settlement, the capital, on Cozumel, San Miguel de Cozumel; it’s a bustling town chock-full of souvenir shops, duty-free emporiums, bars, and assorted cafés and restaurants. If you arrive on the island by ferry from the mainland, you’ll be dropped off directly opposite the heart of the downtown area, Plaza del Sol, also called the zócalo. This large, tree-lined square is where everyone meets for coffee, or lunch at one of the cafés nearby. Several streets surrounding the square are traffic-free, and you can stroll at your leisure among the stores selling T-shirts, pottery, onyx, and silver. The storeowners have a practiced line and can be pretty persuasive, so it pays to have a sense of humor — or a few words of Spanish so you can join in the banter.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt

It is lined with numerous duty-free stores selling fragrances, designer clothing, and jewelry and gemstones. Above these are bars and restaurants that keep the street buzzing until the early hours of the morning. Stop in at the Museo de la Isla de Cozumel (Museum of the Island of Cozumel) on Avenida Melgar, which displays some interesting artifacts found on the island and salvaged from wrecks around its shores. The two main rooms on the first floor offer simple explanations about the geology of the Yucatán peninsula and the development of coral reefs offshore. The second-floor rooms tell the story of Cozumel’s history, from ancient Mayan carvings to conquistador helmets and swords. There is also a room dedicated to the families who settled in Cozumel in the 19th century — after the War of the Castes — and who have developed the island since that time.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
Changsha<n>If you go to Changsha by train, you will arrive at the second biggest railway station in China, a distinction quite out of proportion to the amount of rail traffic or the size of the city. The explanation is that, until the late 1970s, legions of pilgrims converged on this provincial capital in search of the roots of Chairman Mao Zedong. Now that the cult of Mao has faded in glory, the stations and the shrines are uncrowded and Changsha has returned to its age-old role as a rather prosaic regional center of trade and culture. However, the surrounding fertile countryside is attractive, the spicy Hunan cuisine is worth trying, the scenic mountain areas of the province are outstanding, and the archaeological displays are stunning.<n>The capital of Hunan Province, Changsha lies along the Xiang River, a wide and often turbulent stream that flows into the Yangzi. The long thin strip of Orange Island (Juzizhou), rich in oranges among other crops, bisects the river and in the early 20th century was home to a small band of Western traders and missionaries. From the pavilion at the southern tip there is an engrossing view of sampans, barge trains, and passenger ships. On the far side of the river, fragrant forests climb the slopes of Yuelu Hill, a favorite escape from the subtropical heat of the city in summer. One of the evergreen trees in the mountainside Lushan Temple is more than 1,700 years old. The Qing Dynasty pavilion on top (Yunlugong) affords a fine panorama.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
One of the country’s best-known Buddhist monasteries, Hangzhou’s Lingyin Temple (“Spirits’ Retreat”), west of West Lake, attracts crowds of Chinese tourists and believers. The monks — for this is a working monastery — are kept busy supplying joss (incense) sticks to devout or merely fun-loving visitors. The main hall contains a statue of the Buddha seated on a lotus leaf. Carved of camphorwood, it is 191⁄2 m (64 ft) high and thought to be the largest such sculpture in China. Nearby, the “Peak That Flew from Afar” (Feilaifeng) shelters 380 Buddhist stone carvings created during the Yuan Dynasty and four sacred caves. The most famous sculpture is of the Laughing Buddha with a bulging belly, an animated figure fashioned about a thousand years ago.<n>Further southwest into the lush West Lake hills is the village of Dragon Well, where Hangzhou’s celebrated Longjing tea is cultivated. The villagers welcome visitors who arrive by local bus or bicycle, sharing cups of tea and selling the precious leaves. On the way, it’s worth a stop at the China Tea Museum, a recently expanded attraction with displays of ceremonial tea implements and its own model teahouses.<n>Hangzhou is also renowned for its silks. The Hangzhou Silk and Satin Printing and Dyeing Complex is the largest in China. Tours follow the production process from the sorting of cocoons, which arrive by barge in 20-kg (44-pound) sacks, to the silk-screen printing stage. At the end of the line is a shop where foreign visitors, exploiting their newly gained expertise, browse through the bolts of silk.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt

The lakeside promenade also provides plenty of shopping and small restaurants. But the essence of Hangzhou is its scenery. The lake and hills afford some of the most scenic walking and bicycling of any city in China.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
You’ll see the corrida at its most thrilling in the demanding rings of Alicante, Cartagena, and Murcia. Top matadors — qualified toreros who fight fully grown half-ton bulls — occasionally appear in Benidorm, while novice fighters can be seen in other tourist centres. Don’t underestimate newcomers to the ring. Among them may be another El Cordobés on the way up.<n>Perhaps the best seats to buy for a first fight are sol y sombra, tendido bajo, lower stands in the sun part of the time and in the shade the other. The first two rows are the most expensive. Admission prices are lower in Alicante than in Benidorm. Tickets everywhere are 20 percent more than the official price when purchased from agencies and as much as 40 percent more from hotels. Whether you have booked in advance or not, try to arrive at the plaza de toros with an hour to spare, enough time to watch the crowd and feel the tension rising. The corrida always starts on time — even if the clock occasionally has to be stopped.<n>The usual six bulls, fought by three matadors, give an average spectacle of 21⁄2 hours, so a cushion hired on the spot is a good idea. You should remember that the bullfight is neither a sport nor a competition. It’s a highly ritualized three-act art form that depends initially on the aggressiveness of the bull and the torero’s skill and ability to take risks. No risk, and there would be no bullfight.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Where to Go<n>Most visitors to the Costa del Sol are based in one of the large coastal resorts to the west of Málaga (Torremolinos, Benalmádena, Fuengirola, Marbella or Estepona), while far fewer head east toward Nerja, Almuñécar, or even as far as Almería. Although the main aim for many is to relax on the beach and soak up as much sun as possible, increasing numbers arrive to play golf. It comes as little surprise, therefore, that the road signs proclaim the area west of Málaga not just the Costa del Sol, but the Costa del Golf also.<n>A few visitors forsake the beach for a day or two and venture out to either the amazingly varied historic towns and cities or the natural wonders of the national parks nearby. Málaga, Ronda, and perhaps Gibraltar can be seen in a day, but Sevilla, Córdoba, Granada, and the parks necessitate at least an overnight stop.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Málaga to Nerja<n>Leaving the suburbs of Málaga, you arrive immediately in Rincón de la Victoria, a Spanish resort largely given over to weekend apartments owned by the local city dwellers. But prehistoric man was here first, occupying a cave on the Málaga side of the town known as Cueva del Tesoro (Treasure Cave). Cave paintings and prehistoric remains, including a shrine to the goddess Noctiluca, have been found and there is a beautiful underground lake with stalactites. According to legend, five Moorish kings buried a huge treasure inside the cave, but it has never been found.<n>Torre del Mar is the gateway to the wine and raisin-producing region of the Axarquía, and its capital, Vélez-Málaga, which lies 4 km (2 1/2 miles) inland. Founded by the Phoenicians, Vélez sprawls around a historic center dominated by a Moorish alcazaba and two venerable churches: the late-Gothic Iglesia de San Juan Bautista and the Iglesia de Santa María (which incorporates a section of the town’s former mosque).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
For most other museums this would be treasure enough, yet in Iráklion there are also impressive Greek and Roman artifacts to enjoy. The museum is a must for those intending to visit the ancient sites, since the objects here add life to the now empty cities and palaces.<n>To fully appreciate all of its glories will take at least a couple of hours — the exquisite detail in painting on pottery and frescoes, and the fine workmanship in jewelry and everyday tools is breathtaking. Try to visit early to avoid the large tour groups who arrive in the middle of the day. The 20 rooms are arranged in chronological order, grouping artifacts from each site. Although you will surely find your own favorite pieces, here are some of the highlights you will discover on your tour.<n>Room 1 has the earliest finds, dating from 6000 b.c. (Neolithic and Pre-Palace periods). Many were found at Móchlos on the northeastern coast. Primitive pottery is on display — including a rather naïve clay bull with an acrobat holding one horn — and finer work such as a stone pyxis (jewelry box) incised with geometric patterns and a reclining animal. Room 2 is the first of two rooms displaying finds from the Old-Palace period (2000–1700 b.c.), including the earliest examples of fine Kamáresware pottery with its polychrome decoration, found in the ruins at Knossós. Fascinating miniature work is also in evidence, with a series of tiny faience plaques depicting the façades of Minoan houses. Room 3 holds the Phaistós Disc, a 16-cm- (6-inch-) diameter clay disc imprinted with hieroglyphic and geometric symbols that have yet to be deciphered. All other finds here were also uncovered at the palace.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Knossós<n>Five kilometers (3 miles) directly south of the Iráklion is Knossós, now famed worldwide as the village where Sir Arthur Evans (then director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford) found proof that the Cretan civilization of myth had been based on reality. Evans named them the Minoans after their most famous king — Minos. He began digging in 1900 after buying the site and financing the excavation program with his own money, and almost immediately struck the first building blocks of a huge Bronze Age palace replete with magnificent pottery and other artifacts. Evans’ subsequent attempts to recreate areas of the palace have met with intense criticism from other scholars but Knossós is now Crete’s premier attraction and rightly so. Though there is no documented proof, most Cretans believe that Knossós was the site of the famed battle between Theseus and the Minotaur in the Labryinth below King Minos’ palace. You may wish you had a ball of golden thread as you explore the maze of small rooms here, as it is very difficult to follow the map provided. It also becomes very busy in the middle of the day so arrive early if you want to contemplate the site with few distractions.<n>The first palace at Knossós was built around 2000 b.c. in the Old Palace era, but this was destroyed by a massive earthquake only 300 years later. Most of the remains seen at the site today constitute the second palace built following the disaster which also coincided with a Golden Age of Minoan society or the New Palace era — 1700 b.c., when the people were rich through trade, and artistic endeavor was at its peak. The palace grew continuously through the following years resulting in a complex of around 1200 small rooms several stories high covering over 20,000 sq m (215,278 sq ft). The construction was immensely complicated with light wells illuminating lower chambers and polythyra, masonry supports to create structural integrity, between which were large wooden doors serving as partitions.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
What remains today is the outer rim of the original circular island. Sheer cliffs up to 300 m (984 ft) high bound the caldera, and a number of whitewashed settlements nestle along their crests — looking from a distance like icing melting down the sides of a Christmas cake.<n>The main town of the island is Firá, set atop the high cliffs in the center of the long interior curve. Its buildings tumble down towards the water below giving stunning views. A narrow cobbled trail of 587 steps leads from the town to the small port below, now the domain of a fleet of donkeys that wait to carry cruise ship passengers into town. For those who would prefer a quicker method there is also a cable car which wings you from sea level in a couple of minutes. Most commercial ferries arrive at a new port of Athinios further along the coast.<n>Firá is a shopper’s paradise, a series of narrow alleys where you can wander free from the fear of traffic, although do keep eyes and ears open for donkeys. You can buy anything from a reproduction icon to a genuine Fabergé egg; designer jewelry of the finest quality and designer clothing by the most desirable ‘names.’ Find a spot for a drink at sunset, which has to be one of the most spectacular on earth.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Inland from Benidorm<n>The mountains you see off in the distance on Benidorm’s horizon are fragrant with wild herbs and lavender, and in July and August the hedges are lush with blackberries that few local people bother to pick. Drive south on the motorway to Villajoyosa, then take the road that leads to Sella. The countryside is undistinguished, until suddenly you look down on the emerald-green waters of the Amadorio Dam, a favourite haunt of fishermen and discerning picnickers. Within another 5 km (3 miles) you arrive at Sella village, dwarfed beneath an extraordinary plateau.<n>From Sella the road winds higher through terraced hillsides filled with vines until it reaches its highest point at Puerto de Tudóns (1,015 metres/3,345 feet). About 8 km (5 miles) on, a secondary road leads to Peñaguila, an exquisite old Moorish village with a sturdy ruined castle.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
No doubt many Cubans would emigrate if allowed to do so. In August 1994 Castro suddenly lifted restrictions on those wishing to leave (coastal patrols usually force potential émigrés to return). More than 30,000 Cubans tried to cross shark-infested waters to Florida on improvised rafts. Facing a dramatic influx of Cubans, President Clinton abolished the US policy of automatic asylum to Cuban refugees, placing them in a makeshift tent settlement in Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.<n>In the opinion of many, Cuba is an isolated socialist dinosaur. Yet it — and its aging leader — soldier on against all odds. The US embargo, denounced by an ever-increasing majority in the United Nations, is spurred on by vehement anti-Castro lobbying by Cubans in southern Florida. Still, changes in the status quo seem likely. But nearly four decades after the Cuban missile crisis, the world continues to wait, wondering whether a lifting of US trade and tourism sanctions or a change in leadership in Cuba will arrive first.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-History.txt
A legacy of the high-rolling casino days in Cuba, cabarets have been kept alive and well as an outlet for tourist dollars. Cavorting mulatta dancers in sparkling G-strings and pairs of strategically placed stars may not be most peoples’ image of socialist doctrine — but this is Caribbean communism. While the best shows (at the Tropicana clubs in both Havana and Santiago de Cuba) are rather expensive by Cuban standards, seeing at least one big song-and-dance production in the flesh (so to speak) is de riguer.<n>The Tropicana in Havana (Calles 72 and 43, Marianao; Tel. 33-7507), founded in 1939 in a dazzling open-air arena, is indisputably the queen of cabarets. The likes of Nat King Cole performed here in pre-revolutionary times. With a 32-piece orchestra and a cast of over 200 (some parading in impossibly large headdresses), the sheer scale of the spectacle will make your head spin. The show regularly kicks off at 9:30pm, and a shorter performance follows later; there are also a restaurant and disco. Reservations and transportation can be arranged at your hotel for US$60. You can always visit independently, but the venue, situated in the suburb of Marianao, is tricky to find, and you might arrive only to find no tickets remaining. Havana’s next-best cabaret show, smaller and less expensive, is Cabaret Parisien, at the Hotel Nacional (Calles 21 and O, Vedado; Tel. 30-3564), nightly at 10:30pm; admission is US$35.<n>The Tropicana in Santiago de Cuba (Autopista Nacional km 1.5, with signs from Plaza de la Revolución; Tel. 4-3036) fills an enormous, recently constructed complex on the city’s northern outskirts. It is no less impressive than Havana’s but a bit less gaudy. Admission is US$30, including a drink ($27 if purchased from a travel agency).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhatToDo.txt
The Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1762 brought a shattering blow to the population of Louisiana. Overnight, it appeared, they had been handed over to King Charles III of Spain — though the treaty was not announced until 1764. It all made perfect sense to King Louis XV, cousin of Charles (both were Bourbons), for the French and Indian War, known in Europe as the Seven Years War, had been disastrous for French interests abroad. Britain won Canada and everything east of the Mississippi, including Spanish Florida. To Louis, Louisiana was now isolated in a British-ruled part of the world, a money-losing outpost that seemed to have no future.<n>It must have come as an almost unbearable shock to the patriotic Frenchmen of New Orleans to be told that they were Spanish citizens. Waiting for the first Spanish governor to arrive put a huge strain on the disillusioned society. When Governor Antonio de Ulloa finally sailed up the Mississippi in 1766, four years after the treaty was signed, a crashing storm erupted, as if an omen for the climate ahead. The governor, a scholarly retired naval officer with good intentions, was accompanied by a contingent of 80 Spanish soldiers, most of retirement age.<n>The high-society frolics of the Vaudreuil era were over; the Spanish governor’s wife froze out the Creole ladies of New Orleans from official invitation lists. French-speaking citizens protested the snub with a petition and a demonstration that got out of control and turned into violence. Spain called it treason. The harassed Ulloa could take no more and sailed into exile.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_NewOrleans-History.txt
The baron was also toying with the idea of replacing the gracious red brick houses of the triangular place Dauphine with a neo-Grecian colonnaded square when, thankfully, he was forced out of office for juggling the books. Near the lively Pont-Neuf, the place was built in 1607 by Henri IV in honor of his son the dauphin (or future king, Louis XIII). Sadly, only numbers 14 and 26 are still in their original state. Number 10 was the home of film stars Simone Signoret and Yves Montand.<n>The huge Palais de Justice, heart of the centralized French legal system, stands on the site of the Roman palace where the Emperor Julian was crowned in 360. Together with the Conciergerie (see page 30), it sprawls right across the Ile de la Cité. Concealed in the courtyard between them is a Gothic masterpiece, the Sainte-Chapelle, whose fine proportions stand in sharp contrast to the ponderous palace. The chapel was constructed in 1248 to house holy relics, fragments of what were believed to be Jesus’s Crown of Thorns and the True Cross, which pious Louis IX (later canonized as St. Louis) had bought from the Byzantine emperor. Try to arrive as the chapel opens or at sunset (see page 39) and make your way to the upper level, where light blazes in through 15 stained-glass windows separated by buttresses so slim that there seems to be no wall at all. Miraculously, of the 1,134 individual pieces of glass, 720 are 13th-century originals. The chapel provides an exquisite setting for chamber music concerts.<n>Between 1789 and 1815 the chapel assumed various guises: a flour warehouse during the Revolution and a club for high-ranking dandies, then an archive for Napoléon’s Consulate. It was this latter role that saved the chapel from projected destruction, since the bureaucrats could not think of another site in which to put their mountains of paper.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
Portalegre is the prosperous, no-nonsense capital of the northern Alentejo, located near the hills and neolithic monuments of the Serra de São Mamede, 59 km (36 miles) north of Estremoz. Its past wealth, based on carpet and silk production, accounts for the graceful 18th-century mansions lining the Rua 19 de Junho. By far the most interesting sight in town, though, is the Fábrica Real de Tapeçarias (Tapestry Factory), housed in a 17th-century Jesuit school, where dozens of women use great handlooms to weave carpets from thousands of different shades of wool.<n>Horse fans should be sure to visit Alter do Chão (33 km/20 miles southeast of Portalegre), the location of the Coudelaria de Alter Real (Royal Stud Farm), where Portugal’s finest horses are bred. If you arrive in the morning you can watch the Lusitanian and Alter do Chão horses being fed. There is also an interesting museum, and the town has a fine restored castle.<n>Flôr da Rosa and Crato are two small agricultural towns west of Portalegre. In the former is one of the best examples of how the state pousada chain is adapting modern architecture to historic buildings. The inn now occupying the 14th-century Convento de Flôr da Rosa is extraordinary. Outside of town, on the road to Aldeia da Mata, is one of the best-preserved dolmens in Portugal, a mysterious prehistoric chamber sitting unobtrusively in rolling pastoral lands. In Crato is a stately square with an interesting Varanda do Grão Prior, with stone arches under a terrace once used for outdoor Mass, and a municipal museum of local handicrafts and artifacts two doors down. Above town are the curious ruins of the castle, now undergoing extensive restoration.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
On the western flank of the square you’ll find the Museo del Niño (Children’s Museum). No sterile display cases full of artifacts here! This is an entertaining, hands-on activity center where kids can be kids and yet still have a learning experience. There are four floors of interactive exhibits, including a real dentist’s chair where mom or dad can be examined by their offspring, and a giant bubble machine on the upper floor.<n>Behind the museum are a number of other important attractions. Take Calle las Monjas toward San Juan Bay. After a short distance you’ll arrive at the western wall and a small square, Plazuela de la Rogativa, with a bronze statue commemorating the torchlight religious procession, or rogativa, that saved the city in 1797. It’s believed that the lights held by the bishop and the women of the city fooled the British forces in the bay into assuming that Spanish reinforcements had arrived. The British fled empty-handed.<n>Just a short walk north of the square is the Casa Blanca (White House), which for 250 years was the home of the descendants of Ponce de León. Something of a mini-fortress, safe behind its own high wall, the house itself is fascinating — the interior is a museum to life in 16th- and 17th-century San Juan, with many rooms full of period furniture.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
While at La Guancha you may see groups of people across the narrow bay staring down into the water. More likely than not, they’re trying to catch sight of the giant tarpon that have taken to swimming around in the shallows. Hundreds of these fish — some are up to 7 ft (2 m) long — congregate here because they’ve learned they’ll be well supplied with tasty tidbits offered by the humans on shore.<n>North of Ponce are attractions of a different kind. Take Route 503 out of town — this road runs along the banks of the Río Portuguéz — and after about a mile and a half (2 km) you’ll arrive at the Tibes Indian Ceremonial Park, one of the most important Amerindian archaeological sites in the Caribbean. The ceremonial site and cemetery are across the river, and you may not enter without a guide. A small museum explains the known history of the Amerindian races; it has a number of cabinets holding artifacts, as well as a skeleton, still in the traditional fetal burial position. Once you’re into the park, the ceremonial grounds come into view. Open spaces discovered since the 1960s are now believed to be used for “ball games,” which had an important though as yet only poorly understood ceremonial purpose in Indian culture.<n>High in the hills behind Ponce is Hacienda Buena Vista. To get there, take Route 10, a major north-south artery. The road climbs steeply into dense vegetation and cooler air before you see signs for the hacienda; the climate and environmental conditions here were ideal for the coffee that the plantation began to grow more than 150 years ago. The plantation fell into neglect in the 20th century, but since 1984 it has been returned to its original state by The Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico. Agricultural machinery such as coffee bean huskers can be seen in the original buildings, and the water mill and canals, which harnessed the power of the Canas River, are now in working order. The facility shows how plantations used to operate and offer a fascinating insight into agricultural life in Puerto Rico all those years ago. Advance reservations are required for the tours (see page 64).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Just east of La Parguera is Phosphorescent Bay, known for its glowing water filled with micro-organisms. Over the years many residents have built houseboats on the margins of the mangrove, and this has caused problems for the sensitive environment of the bay. The situation is said to be improving now, as new environmental controls are being put into place.<n>Heading west beyond La Parguera, you’ll need to use secondary roads, but these are in surprisingly good condition and relatively quiet. It’s almost a pampas landscape here, with grassy slopes and horses galore. Boquerón, a small village on the west coast, has arguably the most beautiful balneario (public beach) on Puerto Rico, a long arc of fine sand backed by sea grapes and palm trees. The settlement is growing due to its popularity, and a new marina is taking shape, but it still retains the feel of its origins as a fishing village. When the catches arrive, small temporary stalls are set up around the tiny town square. You can buy fresh clams and oysters, which can be shucked for you to eat as you go. There are a few small hotels here, which soon fill up on weekends and holidays, but if you arrive midweek or out of season, you may find that you are the only visitors.<n>South of Boquerón you leave the world behind. Make your way along Route 301 towards Cabo Rojo and the lighthouse at the southwest tip of the island to really enjoy natural Puerto Rico. Fishing is the main way people make a living here — between mangrove outcrops are many small shacks with boats tied up to rickety wooden jetties. The salt flats that you see are still harvested commercially. Eventually, the tarmac stops and the road changes to a simple dirt track. The surface is reasonable, so don’t worry about continuing on. You’ll travel over a narrow bridge and enter a section of the Bosque Estatal de Boquerón. Leave you car below the lighthouse and walk up the hill to reach it (a five-minute walk for the reasonably fit). Turn around as you climb the hill, and a wonderful sandy bay will open out in front of you. Pelicans play and feed, and frigate birds wheel in the sky above.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
The Nao trade route continued until the early 1800s, when José María Morelos y Pavón, a hero of Mexico’s War of Independence, took over Acapulco and stopped the trade, sending the town into a century-long respite, a hiatus that ended only when the Mexican government paved the highway between Mexico City and Acapulco. The beautiful beaches of Acapulco Bay immediately lured Mexico City’s elite, and the metamorphosis began, from slumbering trading port into the “Pearl of the Pacific,” as the media came to know it in the 1930s.<n>The first airplanes from the US began to arrive in the mid-1930s, and with them came a bevy of notorious visitors, from movie stars to presidents, writers to millionaires. Acapulco became the playground for the rich and famous. Glitzy hotels went up in a hurry, supported by new boulevards, power plants, and a superhighway. Acapulco’s peak was the 1940s to 1960s. Celebrated images included Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner sipping margaritas while watching cliff divers at La Quebrada, President Eisenhower meeting Mexico’s President López Mateos for a summit conference in a new high rise hotel, and Johnny Weissmuller swimming laps in the Flamingos Hotel pool overlooking Acapulco Bay.<n>Since those glory days Acapulco has aged — maybe not quite as gracefully as its fans would have hoped. However, the “Perla del Pacífico” still attracts scores of vacationers, who are still regaled by old stories about the rich and famous, told by seasoned waiters as they serve pool-side drinks with a weathered but unwavering smile.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-History.txt
Concerns about safety have led civic leaders to place lifeguard stations along the main beaches and install nighttime lighting.<n>You can fly in from Mexico City or Oaxaca, drive, or take a bus along the scenic Mexican 175 highway through the mountains from Oaxaca. It’s only 250 km (155 miles) but takes a full day. You can also arrive by taxi or car from Huatulco, which takes just about two hours along a fairly well-maintained two-lane highway.<n>Day Trips from Puerto Escondido<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt
