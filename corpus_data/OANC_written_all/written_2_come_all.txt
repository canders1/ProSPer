—Jeff Kernodle, Vice President for Replenishment, VF Corp<n>Many of the popular accounts of quick response, rapid replenishment, and supply-chain management assume that all parties—consumers, retailers, and suppliers—win as a result of these policies. Consumers have definitely benefited because these practices afford them a greater choice of products at lower average prices.1 It is safe to say that lean retailers have also come out ahead, given their rapid growth in relation to, and at the expense of, traditional retailers in many different retail channels. But have suppliers benefited from entering into relations with lean retailers? Have such firms improved their competitive position along with the retailers they supply?<n>The short answer to these questions is “It depends.” Although it is certainly true that a supplier gains from successful customers, the degree to which such a company actually benefits has much to do with its internal manufacturing choices. A supplier that has done little to change its internal practices may end up simply “holding the bag” of a retailer’s inventory. Alternatively, an adept supplier who uses information for planning, production, and distribution may well share in the competitive advantages derived from better information on the true state of final customer demand.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch14.txt
From Supplier Practice to Performance Results<n>Once these manufacturing and information practices have been adopted, it should come as no surprise that they affect the performance of business units. Based on our survey research, we found that implementing a combination of the four key practices—bar codes, EDI, advanced shipping systems, and modular assembly—increases business-unit performance because these practices interact with and reinforce one another. This is sometimes described as “complementarities” between practices. The specific sequence of adoption should also affect performance outcomes.<n>Two types of performance measures are of interest in this regard. The first pertains to operational performance, or the ability of a supplier to respond to lean retailing replenishment requirements. Successful performance includes providing high levels of order completeness, short lead times for new products, and rapid response to requests for replenishment. However, operational performance measures do not necessarily provide a direct financial return to the supplier beyond allowing that firm to continue supplying a retailer with these service requirements. A second set of outcomes relates to the financial performance of the business unit itself. These include impacts on its revenues (prices and sales), cost structures, and profitability. Financial performance encompasses the impact of the supplier’s manufacturing investments on its inventory levels, which directly affects the business unit’s costs and the degree of risk it bears from holding high finished goods or work-in-process inventories.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch14.txt
In Chapter 1, we introduced the fashion triangle, which includes the three types of goods commonly sold by apparel retailers: fashion, fashion-basic, and basic products. Although product variety in apparel has historically been associated with the fashion end of the industry, the number of products available to U.S. consumers in almost every apparel category has grown significantly over the past two decades.<n>Consider men’s shirts. Throughout much of the post–World War II era, the majority of men’s shirts sold in the United States were white dress shirts. But today a shirt manufacturer’s “basic” collection typically includes solid white, blue, and a white/blue weave, as well as white with color stripes in pure cotton, cotton/polyester blends of various mixtures, and other fabrics like 100-percent cotton oxford, pinpoint oxford, and several qualities of broadcloth.12 Most of the collection will come with a choice of collar styles, and some will include a French cuff option. There are also common cuts (“silhouettes”), such as regular, athletic, loose fit, and long. In addition to these dimensions, there are quarterly collections of different fabrics. Each shirt corresponding to a combination of these characteristics—for example, a 16–35 blue, button-down, pinpoint oxford shirt with French cuffs cut long—has its own pattern of demand that varies considerably over the course of a year.13<n>For a retailer, a larger number of SKUs raises the level of uncertainty regarding what product will sell or not sell in any period. In practical terms, this means that a retailer carrying a broader array of goods faces increased costs both for carrying goods in inventory that will not sell (overstocks) and running out of a good that sells beyond expectations (stock-outs). The costs associated with demand uncertainty, which were previously connected primarily with fashion products—that is, the problem of selling a highly perishable item—have grown enormously for apparel retailers. Apparel retailers are not alone: The variety of products offered has increased considerably in most consumer product sectors, from most segments of the retail food industry to home building products to personal computers.14<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch3.txt
High demand variation similarly occurs during the beginning and end of a product life cycle. This variation is due in part to the lower demand volumes during those periods relative to the middle of a product’s life, but such fluctuations also occur because of the inherent uncertainty during the ramp up or ramp down of a product’s life.<n>Demand variation plays a central role in determining a manufacturer’s finished goods inventory levels. In the following case studies, we describe how demand variation can be used to determine a firm’s production and inventory planning processes. These cases offer a rational approach to inventory management for manufacturers, one that is premised on receiving accurate POS information from retailers and maintaining good working relationships with all channel players—for example, retail orders are not placed at the last minute and textile suppliers come through when they say they will. Reality is messier of course: retailers and suppliers often “surprise” manufacturers, and the POS data are rarely perfect or may not even be available. Yet these nagging problems do not negate the need for a new approach to inventory management; they merely indicate how complicated supplier relationships have become.<n>Case 1: Inventory Control at a Men’s Coat Manufacturer<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt
Once demand variation for each SKU was determined for our men’s coat manufacturer, its managers faced the question of how to manage the inventory of the items in its rapid replenishment collection while maintaining a smooth flow of products through the sewing room. Using traditional sewing operations, it typically takes eight weeks to produce a coat, from the time an order is issued for cutting to the moment the finished goods are hanging in a manufacturer’s distribution center. Two weeks are spent in the cutting room, where the cloth is spread, cut, inspected, and has backing material fused to appropriate parts of the outer (“shell”) fabric. Four weeks are spent in assembly processes. The last two weeks involve final inspection, repairs if necessary, shipping to the distribution center, and hanging the finished coats so they can be picked to fill individual orders for a given store.<n>A men’s suit coat or a blazer requires more than a hundred assembly operations (compare this with only forty operations for a men’s shirt); it is one of the most complicated and expensive apparel items to make. Although the number of operations partly determines how long it takes to get a garment through production, other factors come into play, including the firm’s policy about how many finished coats should be allowed to build up in work-in-process and finished goods inventory. Given this manufacturer’s policy of ordering production only when inventory levels dropped below ten weeks, with the production quantity set to restore the inventory to fourteen weeks, the minimum production quantity for each item was four weeks of demand. Thus, at least four weeks of demand—a large quantity for most products—of the same style and size could move through the sewing plant at one time, minimizing setup costs for thread changes and the like.<n>The diagram in Figure 7.5 depicts the production process, including all product and information flows relevant to the inventory decision. In general, to maximize operating profit, a manufacturer must know the factory’s overall cycle time, work-in-process carrying costs, finished or hanging goods carrying costs, unit production costs, and unit selling price, as well as the Cv for each SKU of a given style. The manufacturer in this example effectively had limitless capacity to produce the single-breasted coat, since only approximately 30 percent of the plant’s total capacity was devoted to producing a variety of rapid replenishment items. This capacity could be invoked when necessary by putting aside the lower priority products made in the factory.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt
The number of plies of cloth spread at one time depends on the fabric, which, in turn, determines how many are cut at one time. Thirty plies of denim might be cut together, whereas a hundred to three hundred plies of men’s dress-shirt fabric might be cut at one time. In contrast, a men’s dress suit might be cut from a single ply, or from five or six plies of the same or different material.<n>Spreading the cloth many plies thick without stressing the cloth is, again, one of the quality steps of getting ready to sew. If the cloth has tension before it is cut, then it will contract after it is cut into separate pattern pieces. Because it is easy to stretch many fabrics by up to an inch in a yard, one can imagine the amount of distortion possible in the final garment. But technical innovations have aided the operators. Stresses in the cloth on the lay table can be minimized with the help of mechanical spreading machines, and such devices come in all sizes and costs. The most elaborate allow an operator to ride the machine, which holds the rolls of cloth, so that it can feed the cloth onto the table at a speed that just matches the speed of the machine as it moves along rails fixed to the table. On-board computers compare the location of cloth defects with pattern pieces in the marker. If the type of defect and its location are deemed unacceptable, then the bolt of cloth is cut and a new ply started with enough overlap to ensure that all pattern pieces are whole and without defects. In our sample, business units used some type of automatic spreading for about 39 percent of the volume of goods they shipped.<n>Simpler spreading machines have no on-board computer, but they do unroll the bolt of cloth “unstressed” and properly aligned with the edge of the ply below. However spreading is done, it is important for the plies to lie directly on top of each other. Misalignment of the edges can ruin many pattern pieces and the final garments for which they were intended. Once a ply is laid down, it is almost impossible to shift it because of the friction between the plies. With simple spreading machines, the operator must look for fabric defect indicators placed in the selvage by the textile manufacturer.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
Twenty or more years ago, when lasers were first used to cut cloth, a mixture of polyester and wool as well as 100-percent polyester cloth was common. Attempts were then made to cut several plies of cloth at the same time. The light beam did cut through the plies, but it melted the polyester fibers at the sides of the burn and fused the edges of the cloth together. No matter what is done, the beam affects the edge of the cut. With the lower-intensity laser beams of the past, the bead of fused material at the edge of the cut formed a rough edge and was unpleasant to touch. Some over-edge sewing operations common with knit goods actually trim the edges of cloth just in front of the needle; in these cases any fused material from the laser cutting could be trimmed away. But, if nothing else, the temperature effects on fabric, combined with the cost of installation, appear to limit the use of this technology to those applications in which the connection between plies before sewing could be an advantage.<n>The great advantage of laser-cutting is speed. Modern laser-cutters, developed both in this country and Japan, leave the laser fixed in position and move the light beam around simply by computer-controlled tilting of the mirrors that guide the beam along the desired path. With high-powered lasers, the beam can be moved quickly and still cut through the cloth. There may come a day when the demand for single-ply cutting and the economics of continuous laser-cutting will allow this technology to be more cost effective. Until then, it will not be widely used in the garment trade.<n>Bundling the Parts<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
Mass customization of this sort also means that a single garment must pass through the sewing room at a time. Apparel assembly is described in the next chapter, but for now it is enough to say that all the pieces for a custom garment must be kept together during assembly. If the sewing room is making garments one at a time, it is probably not using the progressive bundle system. Instead, items will be assembled by teams of a few workers, who will do all the assembly operations. Such a short-cycle production system adds to the cost of customized apparel.<n>You cannot make a completely customized item of apparel with just four measurements. The Levi’s process merely adjusts the pattern pieces of a basic style of jeans with these measurements. If a customer wants more areas or features customized, many more measurements are necessary. Achieving consistent measurements presents a major problem because two trained fitters will generally come up with important differences in the body measurements of the same person. No matter how the measurements are taken, most people being measured in this way have a difficult time standing up straight and holding in their stomachs.<n>The second approach to mass customization attempts to overcome some of these problems by optically scanning the customer with light beams in a private area of the store. In this case, the person needs to be dressed in appropriately tight (form fitting, but not form modifying) athletic shorts and a top. The computer-processed results of such a scan are shown in Figure 8.3 (page 148), with a sample of the extracted body dimensions in inches printed on the right side of the figure. For reference, some of the measurements are highlighted and presented as darkened lines on the processed image.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
This machine overcomes the bobbin thread limitation and can operate at higher speeds, but it does have disadvantages. In this case, there is no bobbin. Below the sewing surface, the lower thread is manipulated by a mechanical arm called a looper. The looper inserts a loop of the bottom thread into a loop of the top thread that is created when the needle pierces through the fabric plies and begins to withdraw from the cloth. The top thread is then pulled up by the take-up arm. The top thread cannot be pulled through the cloth because it is held below the fabric by the inserted loop of the bottom thread. The bottom thread is formed into a continuous sequence of very small loops by the looper arm. Although the top and bottom threads are not interlocked, as in the lockstitch machine, the stitch is fixed in place and the seam has a bit more flexibility.<n>Because the bottom thread does not have to be encircled by the top thread, the bottom thread can come from a large cone stored above the machine. A new cone of looper thread contains miles of thread and generally does not have to be replaced more frequently than a few times during a shift. The operator can glance up at the cones of both top and bottom threads and replace them before they run out in the middle of a seam. The disadvantage of this kind of machine is that it makes seams that are not as secure as the lockstitch; in addition, the appearance of the seam from the top and bottom of the fabric is different. If a stitch is skipped—the looper thread is not inserted or may not get caught in the loop of the top thread—then the resulting thread loop could pull the seam out if it were to catch on something. Factory inspectors look for such flaws, but they are hard to find because they end up on the inside of a garment.<n>Nevertheless, the advantages of the chain-stitch machine far outweigh its disadvantages. A chain-stitch seam is strong and can be produced more quickly than a lockstitch seam. Most of the long seams in factory-sewn apparel are made with a chain-stitch machine or with variations of it. The felled seam commonly used for the inseam of jeans comes from a two-needle chain-stitch machine. Such stitching generally outlasts the fabric of jeans, as one can see from looking at the holey knees of jeans worn by many teenagers.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
These issues aside, there is one other major task a sewing operator performs. She must make the pieces of the pattern fit together at the end of the sewing process. This is certainly not possible if there has been a big mistake in cutting, but it is never easy, even without serious cutting errors. If two plies of flat cloth of identical length are placed on top of each other and sewn together, then the ends of the two pieces will not line up without the intervention of a sewing operator. The two ends of a thirty-inch leg seam on a pair of jeans, for instance, might be a quarter of an inch out of alignment unless the operator takes control. During sewing, the feed-dog on the machine—a part that comes up through two slots in the stitch plate and engages the bottom ply of cloth—will pull the bottom ply under the presser foot and against the pull of the thread. The top ply of cloth is carried along by the bottom ply; hence, one ply is stretched more than the other.<n>This simple fact of sewing makes it very difficult to automate the process. In reality, the two seam lines to be joined are rarely exactly the same length. Cutting introduces differences from the top to the bottom of the layers of fabric. No matter how good spreaders and cutters are, preassembly operations are never perfect. The sewing operator must overcome all these prior minor variations, as well as the differences introduced by the sewing process, and make the joining seam come out even at the end. She accomplishes this magic by stretching the two plies differently. First, the plies are stretched to get the pattern notches in the two to align; then the ends are pulled together, causing them to align. The operator uses the elasticity of the cloth to overcome minor errors in cutting and prior sewing. Indeed, most trained sewing operators see this defect correction simply as part of their job.<n>The Sewing Room<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
In my three decades of teaching university courses in child development, I have come to know thousands of students, many of whom were parents or who became parents soon after completing my class. I also served on boards of directors and advisory committees for child-care centers, preschools, elementary schools, and parent organizations. And my research continually drew me into classrooms, where for countless hours I observed and recorded preschool and school-age children’s activities, social interactions, and solitary behaviors, in hopes of answering central questions about how they learn.<n>As a byproduct of those experiences, parents repeatedly approached me with concerns about how to foster their child’s development in the early years. Their fervent questions, at times riddled with doubt and anxiety, revealed that creating optimum learning environments for young children at home—and ensuring their access to development-enhancing experiences in child care, preschool, and school—have become mounting parental challenges.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
By the 1920s and 1930s, millions of parents had adopted behaviorist procedures in one form or another. The most committed were well-educated mothers, who read about conditioning methods in magazine articles and government bulletins on child care. Heeding Watson’s warnings about the dangers of overindulgence, parents mapped out schedules and routines for their young children and tutored them in all manner of skills and in self-controlled conduct. In preschools and kindergartens, behaviorist tenets were used to justify large-group drill on letters, numbers, and general knowledge as well as repetitive worksheet practice that required young children to sit at their desks for long periods, ﬁlling in blanks, coloring within the lines, and otherwise following teacher prescriptions.<n>Parents anxious for their children to display mature behavior were convinced that these experiences would prime them for academic success. But research eventually documented otherwise—that regimented tutoring not adjusted to the child’s interests and capabilities undermines rather than enhances learning, motivation, and self-control. In preschools and kindergartens where much time is spent sitting, listening to teachers, and doing worksheets, children exhibit high levels of stress behaviors, such as wiggling, withdrawal, and talking out. They also show a decline in self-conﬁdence and motivation, expressing doubts about their own ability and retreating from challenging problems. Furthermore, when followed up during the ﬁrst few years of school, children who spent their kindergarten year in a highly teacher-directed classroom achieve more poorly than do agemates who come from kindergartens emphasizing play and hands-on, small-group projects.28<n>Recall 4-year-old Lydia’s dislike of her academic preschool, described at the beginning of this chapter. Lydia’s negative reaction is certainly consistent with research ﬁndings. The behaviorist presumption that development can be mechanically engineered by social input, guaranteeing brighter, socially more mature children, is not borne out by the evidence.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
As Damon explains, the child-centered philosophy was a major breakthrough when ﬁrst introduced, in that it made parents and teachers aware that children have unique needs and beneﬁt from warmth and encouragement. But, Damon contends, modern child-centeredness has been stretched to the point of unrestrained child gratiﬁcation, resulting in a youth culture in which children and adolescents are less engaged, less purposeful, less accomplished academically, and more egoistic and antisocial than in previous generations.<n>Damon acknowledges that economic constraints and other family pressures play a part in this youth disaection. But he places most blame on how contemporary children are reared. Child-centeredness, Damon explains, has become an excuse for a rudderless parenting and educational culture that makes few demands while fostering in children a stress-free, “feel-good” attitude in which children are told, ”You’re lovable,” “You’re great,” “You’re terriﬁc,” regardless of what they do. But because these messages have no basis in meaningful attainment, they are counterproductive. Sooner or later, children see through them, come to mistrust the adults who repeat them, and begin to doubt themselves.<n>Damon neither endorses the insensitivity of adult dominance nor the tumultuous reign of the child. Instead, he underscores that children are avid, active learners, but adults must cultivate their drive toward mastery. They must induce children to develop talents, skills, good values, and a sense of accomplishment through engagement not just in activities that are easy and fun, but in ones that are meaningful and challenging—that help them sustain eort in the face of diculty, overcome obstacles, and advance to greater heights.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
Consider the early attachment bond that builds between caregiver and baby during the ﬁrst year of life. By age 6 to 8 months, infants single out their parents and other stable, loving caregivers for expressions of joy and turn to them for comfort when anxious and afraid. An overwhelming consensus of research shows that sensitive caregiving—responding to the baby’s cries for physical care and stimulation promptly, consistently, and appropriately—supports the development of a secure attachment relationship.7 Securely attached infants actively seek contact with and are easily consoled by their familiar, responsive caregiver. Yet such infants are not destined to become immaturely dependent! Rather, by the end of the ﬁrst year, their exploration of the physical world is conﬁdent, persistent, and complex. And they are less likely to cry and more likely to use gestures and words to express their desires than are infants whose parents delayed or failed to respond to their calls for help.8<n>Sensitive care builds an interdependent relationship between parent and baby—one in which physical and emotional closeness becomes the context for encouraging more mature behavior. Attachment serves as the springboard for a great many capacities that make their ﬁrst appearance in the second year—self-conﬁdence, compliance and cooperation; awareness of others’ needs and desires, and empathy and sympathy (emotions that enable us to feel for and help others in need).9 But the parent who fails to respond promptly and predictably, intervening only after the baby has become extremely agitated, teaches the infant to rise rapidly to intense distress. The baby has learned that only when he is distraught will the parent reliably come to his aid. As a result, he is more dicult to soothe, to encourage to communicate in ways other than crying, and to guide in acquiring other vital competencies.10<n>An analogous circumstance exists at older ages, as Anselmo’s interactions with his parents reveal. Jim’s refusal to help Anselmo with his homework, in hopes of instilling independence, is counterproductive. Anselmo’s crying and pleading accelerate, to the point that anxiety prevents him from focusing on the task. Denying Anselmo assistance yields precisely what it was intended to prevent—a dependent, doubting child. As Anselmo’s parents refrain from helping, they fuel his anger and demandingness, and ultimately his sense of helplessness. When Talia ﬁnally responds, she does so out of desperation—to stop Anselmo’s agitated appeals, which are about to escalate beyond control. Consequently, Talia assists inappropriately, by doing the task for him.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
Research consistently demonstrates that language development in early childhood is strongly related to later reading competence—and to academic achievement in general during elementary school.89 Furthermore, both language progress and an array of emergent-literacy skills can be predicted by the sheer amount of verbal interaction in the home during the ﬁrst few years of life—a relationship that holds for children of all socioeconomic levels. Conversations with adults are especially powerful contributors to early childhood language proﬁciency and, in turn, to literacy development.90<n>A strong language foundation is vital for becoming literate because people read to extract meaning. Children can more easily derive meaning from the printed page when their vocabularies are large and they have come to think in ways that resemble the narrative styles on which the large majority of written texts are based. By repeatedly listening to and participating in narrative conversation, children develop mental scripts for the way narratives are typically organized. Then, when they start to read, the organization of text material readily makes sense to them, and they extract meaning more easily.<n>One of the clearest indicators of young children’s understanding of stories, and other prereading skills, is the extent to which they can give elaborate, detailed accounts of past events.91 Children sharpen this competency through conversing with adults, who add information, ask questions, and prompt children to increase the sophistication of their descriptions and explanations—in essence, who use an elaborative style of narrative talk. Whitehurst and his colleagues have encouraged parents and teachers of young children to integrate the elaborative narrative style into shared adult–child storybook reading, an approach called dialogic reading.92<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
“I can’t remember much family togetherness when I was a kid,” Hannah remarked. “Our parents couldn’t talk things out with each other, and they rarely talked things out with us. Mom took Sarah and me to Girl Scouts, swimming, piano, and other lessons. We enjoyed the activities and the friends we made, but they couldn’t compensate for what was missing: warm, family time. We almost never sat down to a meal together or went places together; we each went our own way. Our dad started going o on vacations by himself when holidays rolled around, so family get-togethers were rare.<n>“When our parents split up, we moved with our mom from Arkansas to Seattle. Mom worked all week, weekends, and most evenings. She had to get a career going so there’d be money to live on and to send us to college. Sarah hung out with another family in the neighborhood. A couple of times a week, she had dinner and went to church with them. Looking back, I’d say they were her substitute family; she ‘adopted’ them, and they ‘adopted’ her. I was too young to go o on my own that way. When I didn’t have after-school activities, Mom insisted that I come home and do chores and homework. Sometimes I got to go to a friend’s house to play, but many nights I’d open a can of spaghetti and have dinner by myself. I spent hours daydreaming and looking at old pictures of Mom, Dad, Sarah, and me.”<n>On ﬁnishing high school, Sarah chose a religiously aliated college of the same denomination as that of her “alternative” family. The year after her college graduation, Sarah married a devout classmate, entering into a culture in which family life was pivotal. Six years later, Hannah started college, but for her the road to maturity was rough. She had diculty concentrating, earned uneven grades, and accumulated so many incompletes in courses that the university prohibited her from reenrolling until she wrapped up her “unﬁnished business.” Frustrated with Hannah’s undirectedness, her mother withdrew ﬁnancial support and insisted that she get a job. Hannah’s full-time waitressing soon became both an obstacle and an excuse for lack of progress in her studies. “I was at sea,” Hannah recalled. “I didn’t have any conﬁdence in myself, and I didn’t think I could do anything. So I started visiting Aunt Eva and Uncle Charlie, who lived three hours away.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
What factors contributed to Hannah’s turnabout? Shared understanding (intersubjectivity) between adult and child, scaolding of new competencies, narrative conversations prompting a redeﬁnition of self, and joint engagement in culturally meaningful activities—the diverse experiences we have considered that create the zone of proximal development—appear to be at the heart of her success story. Indeed, Hannah’s tale suggests that young children denied these supports can still proﬁt from them later, if such supports are available and they have the fortitude to capitalize on them. But not all young people are as fortunate as Hannah. Some remain profoundly impaired by inadequate adult investment in their childhoods. And even those who fare reasonably well may carry with them inner wounds—a sense of emptiness and regret at having missed self-deﬁning, conﬁdence-inducing early experiences that cannot, in the ﬁnal analysis, be recaptured.<n>Experts asked to reﬂect on the malaise and problematic behavior of children today repeatedly comment that they lack sucient adult guidance and involvement.127 We have seen that children come into the world marvelously prepared to enter into partnerships with parents and other caregivers. In the course of this chapter, I have had much to say about just how parents and teachers can capitalize on children’s natural propensities. Vygotsky’s concept of the “zone” clariﬁes for us the meaning of true “quality time.” What must we do to keep young children in the “zone,” motivated, involved, and ever advancing to new heights? Here is a brief recap of the communicative principles we have considered:<n>•Forge an adult–child relationship based on shared understanding, or intersubjectivity—one in which the adult strives to “connect” with the child by “stretching down” to his or her point of view, thereby helping the child “stretch up” to the adult’s more mature perspective. Intersubjectivity is essential for all successful dialogue.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
•Communicate with high warmth, using a positive emotional tone and providing explanations and justiﬁcations for your expectations. When adult–child relationships are sympathetic and caring, children want to acquire skills and behave in ways that preserve those gratifying ties. They are also more willing to work toward goals that are rational and reasonable. Authoritative parenting, which combines the motivating power of warmth with the guidance inherent in scaolding, predicts many aspects of children’s competence.<n>•Engage children in narrative conversation about personal experiences, using an elaborative conversational style that poses many varied questions and that expands on the child’s statements. Through narrative, children build an autobiographical self permeated with cultural beliefs and values; come to understand that people have rich mental lives and may view the same events dierently; and acquire negotiation strategies for resolving disputes and getting along with others. Narrative conversation also fosters language development and emergent literacy, which greatly ease the task of learning to read and write when children get to school.<n>Through dialogues with children, adults play a formative role in the development of children’s self-conceptions, sensitivity to others, cognition, academic knowledge, morality, social skills, and capacity to use language to gain control over thought and behavior. Can parents and teachers actually witness young children undergoing these social-to-psychological transformations? Let’s turn now to a consideration of children’s inner mental lives, as manifested in the dialogues they carry on with themselves. In the next chapter, I address a question that has long intrigued child development theorists and puzzled many parents and teachers: Why do children talk to themselves?<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
According to Vygotsky, children’s greatest self-control occurs during make-believe play. They achieve their maximum display of willpower when at their own initiative they renounce a momentary attraction in favor of rule-governed behavior.14 The paradox of make-believe is that in everyday life, when children subordinate actions to rules, they usually give up something they want—instead of keeping a treasured toy all to themselves, they share it; instead of continuing to play, they clean up; instead of watching more TV, they go to bed. During fantasy play, however, renouncing impulse and following social rules are central to the fun of playing. Rather than frustrating or disappointing the child, self-restraint is the route to maximum pleasure.<n>In sum, subordinating immediate desires to the rules of make-believe scenes becomes a new form of desire15—one that responds to the child’s need to become an accepted member of his or her culture. Indeed, if you watch preschoolers at play, you will see that they rarely violate the rules of their social world. And as they jointly create play scripts and follow social rules with peers, they come to appreciate society’s norms and strive to uphold them. A child playing storekeeper experiences ﬁrsthand the reasons for having customers line up to pay, for making change accurately, and for being polite. A child playing parent in a household scene becomes aware of parental responsibilities and why it’s important for children to follow their parents’ directives.<n>In fact, an adult who breaks a rule in make-believe usually brings preschoolers’ profound respect for social order into bold relief! Cara, a demanding but spirited 5-year-old, likes to initiate make-believe with the following transparent role reversal: “Mom, I’ll be the mother, and you be my child 5 years old.” Cara’s mother plays along for a while and then deliberately transgresses, refusing to eat her vegetables or pick up her toys. At the ﬁrst sign of misbehavior, Cara lectures in a tone of voice well beyond her years: “Children must obey their parents because their parents know things they don’t, so the parents must take care of them.” As Cara’s pronouncement makes clear, play creates a “zone” through which preschoolers internalize a basic sense of social responsibility and morality. At the same time, they acquire a wealth of practical knowledge and skills.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Vygotsky regarded the sociodramatic play of the preschool years as essential for further development of play—speciﬁcally, for movement toward game play in middle childhood. In make-believe, the rules of play are implicit; preschoolers are hardly aware of enacting them. Instead, they are caught up in creating imaginary situations—putting a stuffed animal to bed, driving an ambulance to a train crash, or ringing up a customer’s purchase at the cash register. Winning and losing, team membership and competition, and purposefully laying down rules are not of great interest to preschoolers. Try playing a rule-based game with a 3- or 4-year-old, and you are likely to ﬁnd that the child is easily sidetracked. If, with your prompting and guidance, the child does ﬁnish the game, he or she might say, “I won!” or “Everybody won!” regardless of the outcome.<n>With age, the imaginativeness of play recedes. In the games that captivate school-age children, rules come to the forefront.17 Six- to 8-year-olds are often preoccupied with working out the rules of a game and making sure all players follow them. They often spend as much or more time on the details of how a game should proceed as they do playing the game itself! Nevertheless, every organized game with rules contains an imaginary situation in veiled form. In Monopoly, children are real estate moguls; in baseball, they emulate Hall-of-Fame idols. Children retain both aspects of play, in changing balances, throughout development.<n>Increasing emphasis on the rule-oriented side of play extends the “zone” forged by fantasy play during the preschool years. By making children more aware of the goals of their play activities, game play further strengthens children’s capacity to overcome impulse. Consciously striving to reach a goal requires planning—postponing action in favor of thinking out what to do in advance, organizing one’s behavior in accord with the plan, evaluating how well the plan is working along the way, and revising the plan if necessary.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Furthermore, children acting out stories during pretend play are assisted in mastering the storytelling script, or basic framework of story organization. Preschoolers’ pretend scenarios are often quite storylike, consisting of characters, settings, and plot sequences that include adventure, suspense, surprise, conﬂict, and resolution. Witness the following trip to Sea World, during which Emily and her friends save Baby Shamu from danger:<n>S: (to Emily) Would you come with us? Let’s go to Sea World.<n>E: Sea World! Let’s watch Shamu! I’m the mom. (All three children run to one end of the room and sit down next to one another. They gaze toward the other end of the room.)<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
“Right, a cloak is a coat,” Lizzie explained. The amount of time preschoolers spent talking with peers while pretending is positively associated with the size of their vocabularies at age 5.27<n>As children engage in play talk, they not only build their vocabularies but correct one another’s errors, either directly or by demonstrating the acceptable way to speak. In one instance, a kindergartner enacting a telephone conversation said, “Hello, come to my house, please.” Her play partner quickly countered with appropriate telephone greeting behavior: “No, ﬁrst you’ve got to say ‘How are you? What are you doing?’”28<n>Furthermore, the language skills required to express different points of view, resolve disagreements, and persuade peers to collaborate so play can continue are complex and often subtle. Emily’s success in convincing several classmates to join the make-believe trip to Sea World was partly due to the way she approached them—by asking if they’d like to go. By experimenting with language during play, children can see how others react to various styles of communication and use that information to reﬁne their way of speaking. In this way, play is an ideal arena for mastering all aspects of conversational dialogue.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Research indicates that parents and teachers rarely mediate preschoolers’ peer relations unless intense disagreements arise that threaten safety or (in the case of teachers) classroom order.76 And when adults do step in, they seldom use interventions that help children regulate their own interaction. Instead, adults often resort to directive strategies, in which they tell children exactly what to say and do and therefore solve the problem for them, as in, “Don’t grab. Ask for a turn!” or “Wait until Sandra is ﬁnished.”77<n>These techniques are appropriate for children who lack social skills and therefore, at least initially, beneﬁt from clear direction. But adults need to modify these strategies to suit children’s play maturity, providing assistance tailored to the child’s “zone.” Sticking with directive interventions does not prompt children to come up with effective solutions to conﬂict as it arises—strategies that work because they take into account both the child’s and the playmate’s desires.<n>At times, the adult might model a social skill or give the child examples of strategies, as in, “You could ask Paul, ‘Would you let me try it for a while?’ or you could say, ‘May we share it?’” At other times, the adult might encourage the child to generate possible strategies: “What could you do to get Mary and Andrea to let you play, too?” In each instance, parents and teachers select the level of support that best matches the child’s current social capacities and then pull back as the child acquires new social problem-solving skills.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
I’m expecting a new baby. How much is too much information for a 4-year-old about pregnancy and childbirth?<n>It’s easy to tell preschool and young school-age children too much about pregnancy and childbirth—more than they are capable of understanding. The best approach is to respond to their questions with simple, direct answers. The younger the preschooler, the less likely he or she is to notice the pregnant mother’s growing tummy and to be interested in how the baby got in there. Such questions as, “Where do babies come from?” “Where did I come from?” and “How does a baby get born?” rarely occur before age 5.<n>When children do ask these questions, parents vary widely in how much information they are comfortable in providing. Up to age 8 or 9, most children are satisﬁed with such general explanations as it “starts as a little seed inside the mother, which grows into a baby,” “grows in a special space in the mother’s tummy called a uterus,” and “when the baby’s ready to be born, the mother’s uterus squeezes and squeezes, and the baby comes out.” Some parents show their child books with pictures of fetuses, identifying those that are about the same age as the forthcoming sibling and discussing the baby’s development as it progresses. There’s no evidence that this is in any way harmful or that it’s necessary during early childhood; rather, it’s a matter of parental choice.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
Most children build up to a tantrum gradually. Parents can tell it’s in the offing, and sometimes they can distract the child before it reaches a peak. For example, if the child is about to “blow” while you’re out shopping, try involving the child in the shopping experience—pointing out things of interest to the child; asking the child to help you select and carry purchases; and reminding the child that after the shopping is ﬁnished, you are going to do something the child enjoys. When parents interrupt a tantrum on the rise by redirecting the child’s attention, they provide strategies children can use on their own to regulate emotion. If parents always wait to intervene after the child has become intensely distressed, it’s harder not only for the parent to calm the child but for the child to learn to calm down. And once the child regains emotional control, reassuring the child of parental love with hugs and comforting words restores the parent–child relationship and strengthens the child’s sense of security.<n>Make-believe play is an effective context in which preschoolers can practice what to do when frustrated. Parent and child can take turns acting out the “parent” and “child” roles. While playing the “child,” the parent can get upset. Then parent and child can come up with ways to help the “child” control intense feelings. Occasionally during make-believe, children send parents clear messages about disciplinary tactics they want and need to quell tantrums. In one instance, Sonja, a mother at wit’s end over her 4-year-old daughter Meredith’s frequent ﬁts of kicking and screaming, consulted a child psychologist. The psychologist had Meredith play the “mother” and Sonja play the “child.”<n>When the “child” asked for a cookie, the “mother” said, “No cookies before dinner. You can have a cookie after dinner.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
If parents experience intensifying sibling conﬂict, they may want to reevaluate their communication with each child. Warmth and frequent expressions of affection are associated with positive sibling interaction, whereas harshness and coldness are associated with sibling antagonism.41 Once established, this link between parent–child and sibling relationships is self-perpetuating. Warm parenting fosters considerate sibling interaction, which prompts positive parental communication in the future. When parents are hostile and coercive, children act similarly toward their siblings, and parental anger escalates.<n>The elementary school years are a time when sibling conﬂict can increase. As children get feedback about how well they are doing in school and in other activities (such as sports and music lessons), parents may compare their accomplishments, especially when siblings are close in age and the same gender. The child who feels less valued is likely to resent a sibling whom parents seem to prefer. Therefore, when praising one child, parents should try not to diminish the merits of another. If a sibling expresses jealousy, parents can remind the envious child of an admirable personal trait or a recent commendable performance. But be careful not to give empty praise (not based on real accomplishment), which children quickly come to mistrust. It may fuel jealousy of a sibling, whom the child concludes parents really appreciate.<n>In sum, parents can foster positive sibling ties through expressing warmth and affection, stressing each child’s positive qualities and achievements, and refraining from making comparisons. When sibling relationships are friendly and sympathetic, they bring many beneﬁts, including gratifying companionship, emotional support, and assistance with everyday tasks.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
American parents often express uncertainty about helping their child with homework. They worry that by providing help, they will discourage self-reliance in thinking and problem solving. Vygotsky’s concept of the “zone” underscores that children acquire the many capacities they need to learn autonomously from the assistance of parents, teachers, and other more expert adults. By collaborating with the child on a challenging task, the adult assesses what the child can already do and what the child is ready to learn, providing a support system for mastery.<n>The metaphor of a scaffold, discussed in Chapter 2, is an excellent guide for how to help your child with homework. Scaffolding involves varying your assistance to ﬁt the child’s changing competence. When the child says, “I don’t understand,” you can adjust the task, breaking it into smaller parts. You can also provide prompts, hints, and explanations, increasing the amount and directiveness of your guidance until the child makes progress. As you do so, you can assist the child in analyzing why certain problem-solving approaches work and others do not, encouraging her to come up with ideas for surmounting difficulties. As she starts to apply the strategies derived from your dialogue, you can reduce the intensity of your intervention, letting her take over responsibility for the task.<n>Too often, parents imagine that their child’s classmates can do the homework assignment independently. After all, they say to themselves, why would the teacher have assigned it if this weren’t so? This pattern of reasoning leads parents down a counterproductive path. “What’s wrong with my child?” they say to themselves. “She should be able to do the assignment, just like everyone else!” But recall that children of the same age differ widely in their “zones.” And rooted in the very idea of the “zone” is that learning requires teaching! Children in our culture frequently are rebuked for seeking help, a response that promotes dependency, helplessness, and retreat from challenge, not competence and autonomy.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
Also, subtle feedback from adults undermines girls’ conﬁdence in their ability to do well at math. If a parent or teacher believes that a child is not very capable at a school subject, the adult may act surprised when the child succeeds, ascribing good performance to luck by saying something like this: “Gee, you did a lot better than I expected!” And when the child fails, the adult may explain the failure by referring to mediocre ability: “You’re not very good at that, are you?” Girls get much more of this type of feedback than do boys, especially in math.60 In contrast, parents and teachers often attribute boys’ poor performance to misbehavior and lack of motivation. “If only you’d listen and try,” they say, “you’d do much better.”<n>As a result of these messages, too many girls come to believe that when they succeed at math, their ability didn’t help them. And after failure, they reason that weak ability, not insufficient effort, was at fault. Children who hold these discouraging explanations for their performance often come apart with anxiety when a task is difficult. They say to themselves, “I can’t do this! It’s too hard!” before they have really tried.61 Although eventually young people ﬁgure out that effort can compensate for low ability, girls may conclude that mastering complex math is not worth the cost—extremely high effort.62 So in high school, they retreat from advanced math courses and math-related careers.<n>Fortunately, parents can do much to foster girls’ self-conﬁdence and achievement in math. Beginning in the preschool years, they can provide girls with toys and activities that promote spatial reasoning and scaffold their mastery of those tasks. And they can assist children of both genders in interpreting their math successes as due to both effort and ability, in understanding that ability accrues from trying hard, and in taking failure as a sign that more effort and better problem-solving strategies are needed.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
Alabados (Hymns)<n>Ancient religious hymns that praises the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ, or a patron saint. The Spanish word alabar means to praise, or to glorify, so most ala-bados start with the words “alabado sea” (praised be). Alabados are usually sung with religious fervor, and many are extremely long with an indefinite number of verses. The Penitentes of New Mexico were known to sing alabados during Lenten rituals, Holy Week processions, and other religious ceremonies. The songs are mystic in nature; many narrate the story of Christ’s life, his anguish, betrayal, his crucifixion and resurrection, and others praise the virtues of suffering and penance. Alabados were sung as ritual prayers in homes, at dawn, noon, and at nightfall, and they were almost always sung at funeral processions. Their melodies are fusions of indigenous music and medieval chants. Stories of Mexican California narrate the singing of alabados first thing in the morning by a family, each member in his/her own room, but all together at the same time. Like the décima (ten-line poetic song) and the romance (four-line song), alabados were introduced into the New World by the Franciscan padres, who taught them to the Indian people as they were teaching them the Bible and converting them to Christianity. In recent times alabados have come to mean any religious hymn sung at wakes or religious ceremonies. Many are very old and the authors unknown, although a few collected in southern Colorado were written by a local singer in the 1940s. Folklorists of the 1930s and 1940s were still able to collect some of these ancient hymns from elderly people who learned them from their parents in the nineteenth century. Juan Rael published one of the first essays on the alabado in 1950, and a recent researcher, William Gonzalez of the University of Utah, calls them “some of the saddest music” (Ingalls B11).<n>See also Los Penitentes<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt
Alambrista (Illegal Border Crosser)<n>Literally, alambre is a wire, and an alambrista is a person who uses alambre. The term has come to mean a person who crosses a wire fence, regardless of the means or method. In this cultural usage the fence is the wire fence along the Mexican-U.S. border, the term is interchangeable with mojado (wetback), which refers to a person who enters the United States illegally by crossing the Rio Grande in Texas. Alambrista is not as common an expression as wetback, but it is used frequently by the media. The Mexican cinema has produced many films about illegal entry into the United States with many characters playing roles as alambristas. An American film with the title Alambrista! The Illegal, written and directed by Robert Young in 1979, deals with the issue of undocumented immigration by portraying the experiences of one man’s journey into the United States and back to Mexico. It is considered a landmark film because of the authentic portrayal of a life of fear and alienation experienced by the main character.<n>Like the term wetback, this is an expression many Chicanos can identify with since many have family members who have entered the United States through nonlegal means. It is part of the folklore repertoire of Chicano culture since the Mexican-U.S. border is politically and culturally a constant element in everyday life.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt

Burritos<n>Literally a little burro or little donkey, a burrito has come to mean a taco made of a wheat flour tortilla instead of a corn tortilla, filled with meat, rice, frijoles (beans), and chile, then folded and rolled up. There are several theories about the origins of the name burrito, and there may be some truth to all of them. One theory is that when flour tortillas became available in northern Mexico, tacos de frijoles, or bean burritos, were easy to carry in the saddle-bags of the vaqueros (cowboys), so for this reason they came to be called burritos as though they were the sidekicks of the vaquero’s horse.<n>Tacos made from corn tortillas are much older; they have been around since the epoch of the Aztecs. Wheat and flour were introduced into New Spain by the Spaniards, and one can see that the flour tortilla is similar to the flat bread found in many Mediterranean countries. Once flour tortillas were discovered, the move to making tacos from flour tortillas was logical. Since corn tortillas are small, and can only bend or fold over once, and flour tortillas are more pliable and can be rolled several times, the flour taco was a natural outcome. A burrito can be made with any type of filling, such as beans, potatoes, chile con carne, chile colorado, carnitas (chile with meat, red chile, roasted pork meat), or even peanut butter.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chB.txt
The expression “low rider” is used to describe the car, the subculture, and the person who drives a vehicle that has been lowered, rides very low, and has been customized. A car, truck, bicycle, van, or motorcycle that has been lowered—and this can be achieved by various methods—means that it sits very close to the ground and has a sleek streamlined appearance. The driver and/or owner is called a low rider and the act of low riding refers to all the activities associated with driving the car: cruising, caravanning, and hopping. Low riders have commonly been associated with cholos (1990s urban youth) and gangs, but traditionally Chicanos seriously involved in low riding and customizing low-rider cars are not involved in gangs, and low-rider clubs actually present an alternative to gang involvement. Low-rider car clubs communicate a message of cultural pride and unity. Although different, the cholo subculture can be closely linked to the low-rider subculture.<n>It is not clear when low riding started, but it was already a custom by the 1930s in Los Angeles and Sacramento, although the name “low rider” did not come into usage until the 1960s. After World War II, because of the growth in the economy, many Chicanos could afford to buy cars, old and new, and the practice of customizing cars and cruising became very popular throughout the Southwest and California during the 1950s. The most popular cars to lower are long ones, such as Fords, Buicks, and Chevrolets. Hydraulic lifts are used to lower and raise both the front and rear ends of a car. Before it was discovered that a hydraulic lift could be used with the batteries stored in the trunk of the car, different methods were used to lower the chassis of the car. Early crude methods were to place heavy bricks and cement bags in the trunk, or to cut the spring’s coils, or lower the car’s blocks. To give the car that lowered look the top might be cut back to lower the roof. In recent times, once a car is “lifted” or “all juiced up,” the driver controls the lift with a hand control.<n>The painting and decorating of the exterior and interior of the car are very important for appearances, personal identity, and also for belonging to a car club and participating in car shows. The interior may be upholstered in crushed velvet, red or black, have wall-to-wall carpeting, a bar, a chandelier, a TV, and a stereo tape deck. The exterior may be painted in two tones, a lacquer mixed with iridescent flakes, or have a pearl finish. Sometimes the undercarriage is chromed and gold-plated. Painting low-rider cars is a specialty only available at certain paint and body shops, so low riders must be aware of such businesses. Besides the painting of the car, other decorative designs or motifs may also be applied, such as pinstriping, fancy lace (a fire design), and murals. Murals of an Aztec or Mayan scene or La Virgen de Guadalupe are popular icons painted on the trunk, hood, or roof of the car. Even though there is similarity in the styles, each car is very different in the final production. There are many techniques employed to arrive at a unique personal style. For instance accessories from different-year models are interchanged, such as side panels from a 1957 model may be cut and welded to a 1952 car, or “’57 Cadillac tail lamps on a ’62 Chevy Impala” (Bright, 196).<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
Machismo<n>Machismo describes a stereotypic image of a Chicano/Latino man who is extraordinarily aggressive, stresses dominance over his wife and family, exhibits physical and sexual prowess, and places strong emphasis on masculine rigidity. Chicano social scientists have authored studies about machismo, noting that it is a stereotype often used against Chicanos to blame them for their underclass social position in American society. Macho literally means “male,” and machismo is the concept of “maleness,” but in American culture it has come to mean an exaggerated masculinity. A masculinity associated with violence, self-centeredness, chauvinism, or alcoholism is not a macho concept recognized by most Chicanos. For Chicanos, un hombre macho is a man who symbolizes dignity, takes care of his family, has respect for all women, especially his mother, and possesses a strong sense of self-identity and character. Many Chicanos grew up influenced by Mexican movies, with characters like Pedro Infante, Cantinflas, Antonio Aguilar, and Jorge Negrete, as men who sang to the beautiful girls and defended the poor by fighting for justice and social equality. These were positive images of machos.<n>The famous Mexican folklorist Vicente Mendoza has stated that the concept of machismo, and the word macho, were not prevalent in Mexican corridos (ballads) and popular culture until the 1940s. Supposedly the word gained popularity after Avila Camacho became president of Mexico because in ballads macho easily rhymed with Camacho.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
La Mano Negra (The Black Hand)<n>In parts of the Southwest, children were disciplined by parents who narrated scary stories of The Black Hand. If they didn’t behave or do as they were told, La Mano Negra would take them away. In the Ernest Baughman Collection at the University of New Mexico Library, an informant narrates being told by her grandfather in Tesuque, New Mexico, about La Mano Negra. A young woman remembers, “My grandfather used to tell us when we were little, about La Mano Negra, that appeared every time little kids were bad and that if we weren’t good and helped him carry in wood and water and feed the animals ‘la mano negra’ would come for us at night. It would get really big, take us from our beds and never bring us back home” (November 1974). Members of the academic electronic listserv CHICLE have held discussions and reminisced about La Mano Negra. One member remembered it by the name of La Mano Pachona without knowing its origin, but the fear of it was well remembered by all.<n>Marc Simmons writes about a legend of La Mano Negra from the town of Bernalillo, New Mexico. An old priest dies, but the villagers believe he was unable to complete all his work because his spirit frequently returns. When the bell of the church is heard ringing late at night, the local Indians come to listen, and they see the spirit of the priest going into the church and praying. They call the Hispanos to come and see, and when the priest is seen in the church one of the observers cries out. At this point the priest places his hand on the missal and vanishes. “Burned through several pages was the scorched imprint of the padre’s hand, La Mano Negro.” Simmons states that he recalls a similar legend from Ireland (2).<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt

The name of the dancers and the dance they perform on Christmas Eve in many parts of the Southwest. In New Mexico the dance is performed by the Pueblo Indians in honor of the Madonna. The dance is also performed in Mexico, Texas, and Arizona during other holidays and saints’ days. Controversy over the origin of this ritual dance-drama has not been resolved, and the literature and research produced keep growing. It is based on a medieval Spanish mystery play, but in the New World version, influenced by Aztec culture and customs, it portrays the betrayal of Montezuma by the Spaniards, and the acceptance of Christianity by Montezuma. Its Iberian origins lie in the conflict between the Christians and Moors. The Danza de los Matachines is probably the only ritual dance that is danced by both Hispanic and Native American communities in New Mexico.<n>The word matachines can translate to mean “clowning” or “trickery,” but can also mean “puppet player,” “jester,” and “buffoon.” Matachines refers to the men who dance as a group; the group is composed usually of twelve men, but can have from ten to fourteen. In sixteenth-century Europe a matachin was a masked dancer, an entertainer who danced with a sword. It is likely that the Moors transplanted the dance to Europe and that matachin may come from the Arabic word mutawajjihin, meaning “to assume a mask.” There are many eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary references to a matachine sword dance, indicating that such a dance was performed in Europe.<n>Similar to the dance-drama of Los Moros y Cristianos, the dance of Los Matachines was taught to the subjugated Indians by the Spanish missionaries as a custom to celebrate on Christian feast days but also as a means of converting them to Catholicism. Flavia Waters Champe’s interpretation is that the dance was brought to New Mexico by Spanish and Mexican settlers who came with De Vargas at the time of the second conquest in 1692.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
This is the Mexican people’s slang term for the government card issued to legal immigrant residents, also known as the “green card,” in the United States. The legal name of the card is Alien Registration Receipt Card (Form I-151 or I-551). The card is no longer a green color, but it has continued to be called this since at least the 1970s. Illegal trafficking in the mica is very common, and there have always been forgeries of the green card and social security cards as well. Undocumented immigrants manage to learn where to purchase such forgeries. In the streets of southern California a person who sells micas is referred to as a miquero. It is unknown how the word mica originated as a name for the green card. In Spanish a mica is a female monkey, but it is used for a woman who flirts with men or a coquette. The mica is definitely an enticement that lures men to the United States.<n>Illegal immigrants come from Mexico in search of work in California and other states of the Southwest, and most are willing to do anything for employment. The folklore generated from this experience has been frozen into legends and family oral histories. The mica is a coveted trophy that opens doors to employment. Sometimes it can be gotten illegally by purchase or legally by marrying an American and becoming a legal resident. These experiences are dramatized in corridos (ballads). One corrido, “Mi Micaela,” hides the word mica in a woman’s name Micaela, but the first line gives it away: “Tú eres mi Mica, Mica, mi Micaela, Tú representas todo lo que mi alma anhela” (You are my Mica, Mica, my Micaela, You represent all that my soul desires). Later in the song there is the following line: “Tienes que ser mi Mica, mi Micaela, Verde como los pastos de las praderas” (You have to be my Mica, my Micaela, Green like the pastures in the fields) (Herrera-Sobek 1993b). The play on words, unknown to the average observer, refers to the acquiring of the green card, the mica.<n>Reference Herrera-Sobek 1993b<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
La Migra (Immigration Officials)<n>La migra is an abbreviated and slang term for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the Border Patrol. The phrase “hay viene la migra!” has been cried out in fear for many generations in Mexicano and Chicano communities and in the workplaces where they are employed. Raids by la migra are commonplace and have been depicted in films, novels, jokes, and verbal narratives for many years. Migra is short for the Spanish word immigración, and has become an important and viable character in the vocabulary and culture of Chicanos and Mexicanos alike. Cartoons and jokes often depict la migra officials as overweight policemen who chase down innocent women and children. In the folk dramas of El Teatro Campesino (the Farmworkers’ Theater), la migra was often characterized as an unscrupulous arrogant patrol officer who accepted bribes from the growers and ordered raids in the agricultural fields to arrest undocumented immigrants the day before payday. Starting in the late 1940s and into the present, la migra made raids in the San Joaquin Valley of California, rounding up braceros who had overstayed their contract time allocation. In recent years la migra has acquired a much more sinister image as individual abuses are shown on television evening news programs. Still, many Chicanos grew up being threatened by their parents that if they didn’t behave, “te vay llevar la migra,” la migra would come and take them away, presumably to Mexico. Native-born Chicano children have played a game of “la migra chasing the Mexican,” similar to the “cowboys and Indians” games of earlier generations.<n>See also El Teatro Campesino<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
Mojado (Wetback)<n>A translation of the word “wetback,” sometimes spelled moja’o, which literally simply means “wet.” It is a pejorative expression, although it is sometimes used by Mexican people to describe themselves and their experience of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to come to the United States. Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos, with the same prejudicial meaning as “greaser” or “spic.” Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants. Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called “wets.”<n>Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels. In Mexico, the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas, a literal translation for the word wetback. In 1955 a well--established Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas, which intended to persuade Mexicans not to go to the United States. It was a political film that incorporated all of the standard characters that would appear in countless other films and novels of the Chicano experience: the wetback, the pocho (half Mexican), the coyote (smuggler) who smuggles people into the United States, and the grower Mister Sterling. An ironic, yet justified ending shows Mister Sterling dumped into the Rio Grande by Mexicans, and as he swims to the U.S. side of the border he is shot by the Border Patrol. In a 1998 article Herrera-Sobek discusses the use of corridos in several Mexican films that depict the plight of the illegal immigrant, or el mojado.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt

The pachuco speech, a combination of English and Spanish, also called caló, was a fascinating fusion drawing from many linguistic sources. Caló was originally the language of the Spanish gypsies, or a dialect of Spanish showing traces of many languages acquired by the gypsies throughout their world wanderings. The pachuco argot utilized several linguistic sources in developing a vocabulary or jargon. These sources were southwestern Spanish, the older archaic Spanish from New Mexico, Mexican slang, standard Spanish from Mexico City, and also words invented by the pachucos themselves. The pachuco dialect was the product of an urban environment, and it is believed the language may have originated in the underworld and drug scene of El Paso. George Carpenter Barker pinpoints almost exactly where the pachuco jargon originated, from the 7-X gang who first met in the neighborhood of Florence and Eighth Streets in El Paso. Arthur Campa believes that pachucos originated as a linguistic group first and had no distinctive dress style. That came later as they moved into a more stable economic environment and had some financial resources.<n>Expressions and vocabulary used by Chicanos today come from the pachuco argot of the 1940s. For example, such words as órale (what’s happening, or O.K.), bato (guy, as in bato loco), califas (California), hay te wuacho (I’ll be seeing you), and la pinta (jail/prison) have been used for generations. The film Zoot Suit, written and directed by Luis Valdez in 1981, depicts the dress, language, and problems of Mexican American youth and especially pachucos in Los Angeles in the 1940s.<n>During the 1940s a caricature of the pachuco was created for the Mexican media in the person of Tin Tan, whose real name was Germán Valdéz (1919–1973). He was an actor and performer who dressed as a stereotypical pachuco and zoot-suiter. Tin Tan made several Mexican films portraying the Mexican American pocho who code-switches between English and Spanish, and speaks caló.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt
Pintos (-as) (Prisoners)<n>Pinto is a term used for prison and also for a Chicano prison inmate. A pinto is a male prisoner, a pinta a female prisoner. La Pinta, referring to prison, is believed to come from the word penitenciaria, or “penitentiary.” Other common words for prison are bote, meaning “can,” and corre, which is short for “correctional institution,” referring specifically to one in Texas. “Joint” is another word frequently used to mean prison.<n>There has been a lot of sociological literature written about the formation of gangs in prisons as a means of surviving incarceration in the United States. The media, including 60 Minutes, has done stories about the activities of the Mexican mafia and La Familia. Often ignored is the subculture of the pinto experience that is exhibited in behavior, art expression, and published poetry. In the early 1970s several Chicano magazines devoted whole issues to literature and art by pintos, always referring to it as pinto art and pinto poetry. A combination of Mexican and prison cultural values dictates the behavior of pintos inside prison and out on the street. Chicano prisoners have a strong sense of family and community and feel they are constantly being watched by their barrio, family, women, and their home-boys peer group. Most Chicano convicts have little education, speak primarily in Spanish, and have a strong sense of Mexican nationalism. Regardless of place of birth, mexicanismo and machismo are a very important part of being a pinto. Ex-pintos are often identifiable by their mannerisms, gestures, language, haircuts, and dress. They are usually extremely clean and well groomed, have very short hair, wear well-pressed pants, and are in excellent physical shape. Within the prison world pintos have established a well-defined and -structured social environment, which they carry to the outside world when released. In discussing the film American Me, Rosa Linda Fregoso states that Edward James Olmos depicts extremely well the expressive behavior of pintos both in prison and outside. In her words, “Besides rendering a Chicano pinto presence in the rhythms of speech, Santana [the movie character] represents it in the stylized walk and prose of a pinto, a stance honed in the corridors behind prison walls or in the barrios of East L.A.” (1993, 130).<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt
A god, one of the major deities of the Aztecs. Quetzal is a Nahuatl word referring to a bird found in Central America, and coatl means “snake,” so Quetzalcoatl means a “feathered serpent,” and this god is often called the Plumed Serpent. Stories about him indicate that he was an earthly hero, a light-skinned man, who acted as the ruler of the Toltecs for some time. In one legend Quetzalcoatl is sent to the underground to get the bones of the ancients. After the end of the Fourth Sun (an Aztec era), when the ancient people have been drowned or changed into fish, the spirits decide he should go seek the bones in order to start a new race. He must try three times, overcoming many obstacles, before he succeeds in bringing the bones to the sky. They are ground to a powder and placed in a bowl by the goddess Cihuacoatl. The other gods shed blood into the bowl and humans are born. Quetzalcoatl discovered corn, which he brought for the new humans to eat. He saw an ant bringing a kernel of corn from inside a mountain, and he changed himself into an ant and followed it. Lightning was used to split open the mountain to bring the corn to the people. He left the Toltecs to return to his home. It just happened that Quetzalcoatl promised to return in the same year that Hernán Cortés landed in Veracruz. It was to the Spaniards’ advantage to use the Indians’ belief in Quetzalcoatl’s return. Cortés was well received because he was thought to be Quetzalcoatl and the conquest of the Aztecs by the Spaniards was legitimized.<n>Quetzalcoatl is one of the better-known Aztec gods and has been greatly idealized by the moderns, including Chicanos. His image has influenced artists, writers, philosophers, and painters for hundreds of years. As the celestial dragon, he is patterned after the rattlesnake, a common mythical creature in Mesoamerica. This dragon has come to symbolize the Chicanos’ early heritage and has been embraced by Chicanos, especially those coming of age in the 1970s. Quetzalcoatl can be found in the literature, murals, and graphic art reflecting Chicano culture and the Chicano movement of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1970 an American Indian and Chicano college was started in northern California with the name Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl College. This college was still in existence in the year 2000 and has struggled to maintain a curriculum that meets the needs of both Indian and Chicano students. Deganawidah was the name of the chief of the Iroquois Federation, and after the college was given his name, it was learned there was a common belief that the name could not be mentioned publicly. Since that time the college has become known as D-Q University.<n>References Bierhorst 1990; Brundage 1979; Carrasco 1992; Lafaye 1983<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chQ.txt
La Raza (The People)<n>The literal translation of this term is “the race,” but it has come to be used as an in-group name for Mexican and Chicano people. Translated as “the people,” it is recognized as meaning all mixed-race Spanish and Indian people, known as mestizos. The term encompasses all Latinos (Latin Americans) who are descendents of the Spanish and Indian encounter. The Mexican intellectual José Vasconcelos wrote a book in 1925 titled La Raza Cósmica: Misión de la Raza Iberoamericana. Publishing after the Mexican Revolution, Vasconcelos envisioned the successful future of Mexico to lie in the strong bonds of its mixed-race population. Before the Revolution, in the nineteenth century, Mexicans looked toward a European identity, and most of the upper classes considered themselves white Europeans. The indigenous population of Mexico was segregated and not racially mixed, and the mestizos were more closely aligned with the Indians than with the upper classes. Vasconcelos wrote his slim volume in his search for a Mexican identity for himself and for Mexico’s population. La Raza is used by Chicanos because they identify as mestizo people and see themselves as members of a special race, a group of people with a distinct heritage and destiny. Chicano writers, artists, professionals, musicians, and students are invigorated by the proclamation of “La Raza!” and inspired to work toward a creative and political unity. In the words of Jose Angel Gutiérrez, as quoted by Arnoldo Vento, “La Raza is the affirmation of the most basic ingredient of our personality, the brownhood of our Indian ancestors wedded to all the other skin colors of mankind. . . . As children of La Raza, we are heirs of a spiritual and biological miracle” (225). The “Viva la Raza!” chant is a frequent opening and closing statement at festivities, concerts, political meetings, anywhere Chicanos might come together. In the 1970s, the first political party to be formed by Chicanos in the U.S. was called La Raza Unida Party. October 12, known in the United States as Columbus Day, is celebrated throughout Latin America as Día de la Raza, or Day of the People. It is celebrated by New York Puerto Ricans and Cubans and Chicanos throughout the country. It marks the birth of Hispanic heritage and the beginning of Hispanic culture because it is the day Columbus landed in the New World. It is unclear if President Ronald Reagan was aware of this when he declared Hispanic Heritage Month to be celebrated September 16 through October 15.<n>References Schmidt 1978; Vento 1998<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chR.txt
La Virgen de Guadalupe<n>Also commonly known as Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, she is the Virgin Mary who appeared to Juan Diego, a Mexican Christian Indian, on December 9, 1531. Historical documents verify the story of her apparitions. She identified herself as the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, and speaking in Nahuatl, she asked Juan Diego to go to the Spanish bishop and ask that a temple be built there where she appeared, the mount of Tepeyac. To Juan Diego she was a beautiful woman who spoke his language, so after much difficulty he sought to speak to the bishop, but his story was not heard, and he was asked to return another day. The beautiful woman appeared to Juan Diego a second time, and he was asked to seek the bishop’s audience again. On the second try Juan Diego saw the bishop, his story was heard and questioned, but was not believed. The bishop wanted a sign from the Great Lady so that he would know it was really she who was sending Juan Diego. Diego intended to go back to Tepeyac and inform the beautiful woman, but when he returned home he found that his uncle Juan Bernardino was extremely ill. The next morning, on December 12, as he walked to Tlatelolco to call a priest to come to his uncle’s side, the beautiful woman came to him a third time asking what was wrong. Diego told her of his sick uncle and of the request from the bishop. She told him his uncle was now well and would not die and sent him to the top of a hill to cut fresh flowers that he was to take to the bishop as proof of her existence. Diego followed her instructions and at the top of the hill he found beautiful roses of Castile, still covered with dew. He cut them and The Lady, the Mother of God, arranged them in his tilma (cloak) and sent him to the bishop, with the proof requested. When Diego unfolded his tilma in front of the bishop, the roses fell to the floor, and there on the tilma was an image of the Virgin Mary. Now the Spanish bishop believed, and as the beautiful woman requested, a church was built right on the mount of Tepeyac. The tilma with the image of the Virgin Mary still hangs in the temple called Guadalupe. The name that the beautiful Lady gave herself was Tlecuauhtlacupeuh, but to the Spaniards it sounded like Guadalupe, which they instantly recognized as “Our Lady of Guadalupe” from Estremadura, Spain. But the Aztecs understood that in the Nahuatl language the name Tlecuauhtlacupeuh meant “la que viene volando de la luz como el águila de fuego” (she who comes flying from the region of light like an eagle of fire).<n>Tonantzin was an Aztec goddess, literally called Our Holy Mother, also known as Tonan. Guadalupe appeared at what was once the temple of Tonantzin at the mount of Tepeyac. Even today in Mexico, La Virgen María is often called Tonantzin. The acceptance of La Virgen de Guadalupe by the indigenous population of Mexico was the beginning of Mexican Christianity and the conversion of the Aztecs to Catholicism. Guadalupe became the symbol of Indian Catholicism, different from the European Catholicism of the Spaniards. As the Aztecs adapted the Catholic religion to their indigenous beliefs, they created a religion that met their own needs and own way of life. She was declared the “Patroness of the Mexican Nation” in 1737, and in 1754 Pope Benedict XIV canonized Guadalupe as an official saint. She was crowned “Queen of Mexico” in 1895, showing how strong a symbol of Mexican nationalism she had become. Today she continues as the country’s strongest symbol of Mexican identity. The cathedral built in her honor can no longer be used because of structural damage, but a new one was built in the early 1970s. Masses are held every hour of the day and the church is constantly filled to capacity.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chV.txt
Although the Spanish word for garden is jardín, many Chicano families favor the term “yard” while referring to their gardens, pronouncing it in Spanish as yarda. Although yarda appears to be a pochismo (Chicano slang), it can be found in Cassell’s Spanish Dictionary. The layout and organizational aesthetics of Chicano yardas are unique enough that folklorists and cultural geographers have written about them. Many yardas can aesthetically constitute yard art, even though it does not appear that this is the intent of the creator. Besides planting shrubs, flowers, and sometimes grass, the gardener will bring into play the creativity that goes into decorating a yard unconsciously, with the result being a folk art display. Invariably, a yard will contain many potted flowers arranged in a patterned manner. The central focus of many yards is often a devotional shrine set up in memory of a family member, with a nicho housing a saint or Madonna, and the design of the yard’s plants and flowers is laid out in reference to the shrine. Some yardas may not have planted grass, but instead hard-packed dirt that is kept free of weeds, swept frequently, and kept prepared for family gatherings. But trees, preferably fruit trees, abound to make shade for family gatherings and outdoor cooking.<n>A common practice among many working-class Mexican Americans is to recycle as much as possible, although the concept that recycling is an environmentally correct thing to do is not always known. Common recycled objects that can be found in yards are tables, kitchen pots, painted tin cans, and car tires used as planters. Tires are cut across the width, making two containers, opened up and cut with a scalloped design around the edges. After being painted and filled with flowers and plants, these plant containers do not even resemble their original form. Recycled tire planters can line a driveway or establish the boundaries of a large yard. The practice of reusing objects that have lost their original purpose, such as kitchen pitchers and pots, is a means of keeping something familiar, something associated with a memory, alive and finding a new use for it. This practice probably originates from poverty, but the historical result has been that it creates its own aesthetic in adding adornment to one’s home and life. These “yardscapes,” as they’ve come to be called, are composed of bits and pieces of one’s personal life and as such can add visual charm and historical value to a home. A family’s religious and cultural values, as well as the special identity of being Mexican American, can be found in yardas.<n>See also Folk Art; Nichos; Yard Shrines<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chY.txt
Zozobra<n>A giant, forty-foot effigy in the form of a puppet, which is burned during the annual Santa Fe Fiesta held in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The word Zozobra translates to “gloom” or “worry” or “anguished.” The Zozobra is ritualistically burned at the beginning of the fiesta, which symbolizes the end of destructiveness, gloom, and worry, setting the tone for a successful fiesta. The creation of Zozobra was introduced into the fiesta in 1926 by Will Shuster, who felt that the fiesta had become “dull and commercialized.” Throughout the years the image of Zozobra changed from a simple twenty-foot puppet to the elaborate forty-foot figure with animated eyes, arms, and mouth that he is today. In 1969 Shuster turned over the responsibility and copyright of Zozobra to the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe. He is hung on a tall pole on a hill, outside the city, where the burning can be seen by the thousands of people who come to watch. The death of gloom is supposed to resurrect happiness.<n>In response to the tradition of the burning of Zozobra, a group of New Mexico Chicanos started a tradition of burning El Kookoóee, a figure known by many Chicanos as the bogeyman, during the Festival de Otoño.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chZ.txt
And who do we fear will invade and intrude upon our island of freedom? At the time of the revolution, the fear was directed toward King George III and his colonial governors. In the newly established Republic, the fear was redirected toward the federal government. This dyadic opposition between individual and state underlies most constitutional thinking to this day. The fear of the federal government has grown into distrust toward all government. According to the official doctrine, the Bill of Rights only applies to limit “state action” encroaching upon individual liberty. As Akhil Amar recently formulated the idea, officials of the state are likely to act for their own benefit rather than the benefit of its citizens.3 Therefore, we must be eternally watchful against overreaching by the state. The purpose of the Constitution is to arm us with the legal means to check the tendency of the state—federal government and indeed all forms of government—to limit our natural freedom.<n>But there is another model of thinking that recognizes the paradox of freedom. If freedom can generate exploitation, then the task of the state should be to intervene to protect the individual against the exploitation by other private individuals. The paradigm of the exploitative, oppressive relationship in the American experience is, of course, slavery, and therefore in 1865, as the first task of the new constitutional order, we banned the very possibility of private relationships of slavery, established either by force or by consensual agreement between master and slave. The Thirteenth Amendment charges the federal government with the responsibility to make sure that neither “slavery” nor “involuntary servitude” shall come to exist in the United States. The amendment does not say that the state may not create relationships of subordination or slavery. It says simply that these private relationships, however they might come about, “shall not exist.” The important point about this formulation is not merely that it dispenses with the requirement of “state action.” It does that and more.<n>The Thirteenth Amendment betokens an entirely new way of thinking about government—not as an ever-threatening enemy, but as a necessary partner in the building of a society free of interpersonal exploitation. The focus of the Thirteenth Amendment is not on the potential evils of government but on the wrongs committed by private parties. Unjust private relationships do not cease existing just because one declares them not to exist. They can arise spontaneously, and in a state of nature some people would inevitably come to dominate others. The passive voice of “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist” means that the government must be ever watchful, lest relationships of exploitation come into being.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt

The passive voice of “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist” means that the government must be ever watchful, lest relationships of exploitation come into being.<n>The new function of government departs radically from the dyadic structure—the individual pitted against the state—underlying the Bill of Rights. The relationship of government to private individuals becomes triadic or three-cornered. The relationship arises between two private parties: slave owner and slave, dominator and subordinate, aggressor and victim. The third pole is the government, which must intervene to insure that the incipient relationship of “involuntary servitude” shall not exist.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt
The assertion of a triadic conception of government brought us into line with the middle European conception of freedom as the privilege that arises from living in a matrix of protective state regulations. It is not nature but the law that makes us free. Freedom is realized not by the state’s absence but from the construction of a network of laws that liberate the individual from the oppression that would otherwise occur. Compulsory temperance and drug laws generate freedom for those who are able to stay clean. Prohibitions against sexual self-degradation and peep shows strengthen the inner freedom of our human selves.<n>This is the European conception of constitutional freedom. When the German Basic Law of 1949 declares human dignity to be the foundational value of the constitution, the implications run through all relationships that may come into being. This “third-party effect” means that private individuals are bound to respect the human dignity in each other, precisely as they are bound not to subject each other to relationships of involuntary servitude or, during Prohibition, not to sell each other alcoholic beverages. Today, men and women must avoid sexual harassment on the job, even though in this case the “third-party” effect arises not directly from the Constitution but from federal legislation.<n>An activist tripartite conception of government requires funding. Fighting a major military campaign to suppress the Southern insurrection required a stronger financial base than the government had needed up to that time. The war drove up spending from the customary 2 percent of the gross national product to 15 percent. (By comparison, in the early 1990s, government spending represented 20 percent of the GNP.)5 With no place left to turn, a Republican Congress approved the first income tax in 1862. By 1865, the income tax generated over 20 percent of federal revenue, the balance coming from tariffs and reintroduced excise taxes.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt
Think first about the way in which the French sought repose from post-revolutionary terror in their Code civil. The country passed through fifteen years of regicide, terror, and mass executions. Amidst voices clamoring for stability and security, Napoleon staged his coup d’état in late 1799. High on his agenda was revamping the legal system. In 1804, he charged a group of lawyers with the task of drafting a new civil code in language accessible to ordinary people. The committee produced the elegant Code civil, now a mainstay of French culture and a model for civil codification all over the world. The language is so refined that the novelist Henri Stendhal reportedly reviewed the style of ten code provisions every night before retiring. Today, when the Francophones in Quebec preach the distinctiveness of their culture, they never fail to mention their Code civil, modeled after Napoleon’s effort to use the law as the means of restoring civilized order to France.<n>The Code civil has proved to be remarkably durable in French culture. Constitutions have come and gone and the French have endured recurrent changes of regime, including communes, dictatorships, and five distinct republics. Yet, through all this, the civil code has survived. It is the cultural monument that unites the French across history.<n>In its substantive content, the Code civil is strongly identified with the achievements of the 1789 Revolution against the ancien regime. The code sweeps away the vestiges of feudal influence in the law of property and in the law of evidence and proclaims a liberal legal order. The end of feudalism in the law of property meant that a single concept of ownership would replace the ancient system of embedded estates. The implication was that all land would be freely alienable, without being burdened by the residual control of lords higher in the feudal chain. The code thus provides the legal foundation for a market economy. The end of feudalism in the field of evidence means that the testimony of a nobleman is no longer worth more than the oath of a peasant. Thus the code institutionalizes the égalité of all citizens, as promised in the slogan of the Revolution.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt
The survivors turned to law. One year into the war, after a string of Union defeats, Lincoln learned that the old Union could not possibly survive. “A new one had to be embraced.”10 And the new Union would have to be based on a new constitutional order. A nation of free Americans, including emancipated slaves, would bear responsibility for rebuilding the United States on the basis of a constitution acceptable to all. Formally speaking, the original charter of 1787 would remain in place, but it would be so radically transformed that it would stand to the ancien United States as the Code civil related to the French feudal order or, as any redeemed legal culture compares to the brutality and chaos that precedes it.<n>The American hope for a new beginning lay in the Reconstruction Amendments—the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth—all enacted in quest of a new definition of freedom and equality under the law. The first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment specified who would be a member of the new polity: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. . . .” With a single stroke the new constitution erased the effects of one of the worst blemishes in American constitutional history—the Dred Scott decision of 1857, which held that persons of African descent could never become citizens of the United States. In the new United States, there would be no discrimination based on blood. The only question that mattered was whether you were born within the polity and whether you were therefore likely to come to maturity with the language and consciousness of American culture.<n>With just boundaries of the new nation-state properly defined, the highest order of business was to define the basic rights of its citizens. The structure of these rights follows the pattern established in the Declaration of Independence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Yet, there was a new recognition that the inalienable rights of all Americans were now to be realized not in the state of nature but under the rule of law. The naturalistic “pursuit of happiness,” celebrated in the Declaration, gives way to the quintessential creature of the law’s definition—property. Yet, the basic rights of life, liberty, and property are inalienable without being absolute. The ideal must be adapted to the practical demands of competing claims. The legal system would have to decide when individuals could fairly be deprived of liberty or property or even of life; thus, the coining of the famous and influential clause of the American Constitution, namely that no “State [shall] deprive any person of life, liberty, or Property, without due Process of law.” The law would define the content and the limits of the inalienable rights celebrated in the Declaration of Independence.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt
These words are, in fact, better known in the United States than the preamble to the first Constitution. Schoolchildren routinely recite them and thereby imbibe the intuition that these words defined America after the Civil War. Yet, because we know these resonant phrases, we rarely stop to listen and ponder the meaning of each well-crafted line. Let us now put ourselves among the crowd of mourners at Gettysburg. Let us transport ourselves back into the frame of mind of those suffering losses, those looking for the meaning of brothers slaughtering brothers.<n>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate—we cannot consecrate—we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch1.txt
With his carefully crafted two-minute speech at Gettysburg, the best political address in the nation’s history, Lincoln created a Nomos, a world of norms and meaning, for comprehending the mass slaughter on American soil. The new understanding of why we were in mourning pointed to a resolution of the conflict and the beginnings of a new constitutional order. Rereading the speech now as the preamble to that new order, we can begin to understand the significance of the phrases so carefully chosen. The words of the Gettysburg Address are too powerful, they represent too much concentrated energy and wisdom, to be absorbed in the two minutes that it takes to read them slowly. I suggest that we proceed and listen, sentence by sentence, phrase by phrase, to these words heard so often.<n>The first sentence states the heart of the matter and sums up the past, present, and future of the American commitment. Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. This sentence alone was enough to formulate the preamble to the new constitution. It harbingers the themes that follow in the address and that will come to dominate American life for the rest of the 1860s. Let us read each of these phrases as elements in the preamble to the postbellum constitutional order.<n>Four score and seven years ago. . . By 1863, a historical consciousness had taken hold in American thinking. Rooting ourselves in the past stands in sharp contrast to the preamble of the 1787 Constitution, which begins simply, without setting the context: “We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union. . . .” There is no reference in the 1787 document to the first settlement dating back some 160 years, no sense that the new country was the outgrowth of an English-speaking culture across the seas. In 1863 the nation still desired to create “a more perfect Union,” but it had in addition a past that both inspired and troubled the newly indigenous psyche.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt
Of course, during the war, the 1787 Constitution remained nominally in force. There was little suggestion of a “military dictatorship,” though some Northern critics of the government invoked the phrase. Lincoln’s elected term came to an end in March 1865. In the midst of the war, therefore, he was constitutionally required to stand for reelection. This event in itself warranted the stability of American institutions, but still ambiguity reigned on the shape of the postbellum constitutional order. The confusion came to a head in 1868 when the House impeached Lincoln’s successor, President Andrew Johnson, for arguably asserting excessive executive power in firing his Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. The outcome of that impeachment trial is well known: Johnson avoided conviction by one vote. Less well known is the outcome of the struggle to develop a new constitutional order, the struggle that is signaled in Lincoln’s address commemorating the dead at Gettysburg.<n>. . . our fathers brought forth on this continent. . . The biblical cadence of these words resonates in memory. We know that we have encountered it someplace before. They remind us of the way God introduces himself to Moses in the Book of Exodus: “I am the God of your father . . . So I have come down to rescue [my people] from the hand of Egypt, to bring it up from that land to a land, goodly and spacious, to a land flowing with milk and honey. . . .” It is not surprising that Lincoln would evoke the style of Exodus. Even the introductory phrase “four score and seven” has a prophetic ring. The Bible, after all, was one of Lincoln’s favorite books—along with the works of Shakespeare and Aesop’s Fables.<n>Garry Wills makes much of the Greek influence in shaping Lincoln’s style at Gettysburg.6 But of the biblical influence on the Gettysburg Address, Wills has almost nothing to say. This is a rather curious twist in seeking to understand the president whose thinking and rhetoric were probably more influenced by the biblical idiom than the writings of any other president. Lincoln’s second inaugural address is replete with references to the Bible, including, notably, the latter part of Psalm 19, 10: “The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.” Lincoln saw the entire Civil War as a righteous judgment of the Divine. It is almost inconceivable that he would seek to formulate a framework for understanding the war’s place in American history without relying on biblical imagery.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt

Significantly, the abolitionist movement in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s brought a passion for religious truth in American politics that had not previously existed. Theodore Parker, among other devout leaders of the movement, preached against “the Slave Power” in tones that made one think that the devil was marching into the new territories. The recognition that slaves, too, were “made in the image of God” provided a powerful rallying point for a crusade to correct the original mistake of 1787. Of course, various biblical passages served the other side as well, but the ardor for abolition drew heavily and indispensably on the sense of a higher law.<n>The Gettysburg Address, as written, apparently did not contain the reference to “this nation, under God.” As he spoke, Lincoln spontaneously broke with his prepared text. The reference to God appears in neither of the drafts that his assistants, John Hay and John Nicolay, said were the prepared texts. Yet, the four journalists who were present reported hearing the divine invocation, though some observers have Lincoln saying “this nation shall under God have a new birth” rather than the word order that has come to be accepted “this nation, under God, shall have a new birth.”14<n>The reference to “this nation under God” reinforces the conception of the nation as an organic entity, a single subject that could, like the Jews, enter into a covenant with a God. The substitution of the Americans for the covenanted Jews—however sacrilegious the idea may sound—landed in the New World with the Puritans and became a standard item of Protestant theology. Thus, we can understand Lincoln referring at Trenton to the Americans as “His [God’s] almost chosen people.”15<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt
The genius of the Gettysburg Address is that it took the words of the Declaration of Independence and found in them a crystallization of a meaning suitable for the refounding of American democracy. In 1776, the idea that “all men are created equal—for all purposes” had no precedent in the declarations of political leaders. Even the great French Declaration of the Rights of Man, issued thirteen years after the French Revolution, preached a more limited version of equality—“All men are born and remain equal under the law.”1 In its original context, the famous five words “all men are created equal” had a limited function. They undermined the pretension of King George III to rule under the divine right of kings. If all men were of equal stature under God, then no one could claim to have been anointed as ruler by supernatural authority. At the same time, however, the famous maxim could also be understood as referring to “men” as collective entities: “all peoples have equal status.” It was not particularly novel to argue that all nations, all states, had an equal claim to govern themselves. The principle of national self-determination, urged so adamantly in the twentieth century, derives from the same source: every nation is entitled to preserve its own culture, cultivate its language, and express itself as a subject of the international community. International law is based on the idea that nations, anchored in the form of states, enter into legal relationships. The states in which nations are embodied enjoy legal personalities. They incur debts and, significantly, these debts are not extinguished by revolutionary changes of government. The forms of the state come and go, and the nation endures through it all. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Declaration of Independence would assert that the American people were equally entitled, with all other nations, to determine their form of government.<n>These two senses of the famous “all men are created equal” capture the ambiguous quality of the American revolt against the British. It was both a revolutionary and an anticolonial war of independence. The revolutionary spirit was captured in the categorical rejection of monarchy. The anticolonial thrust appears in the assertion of the Americans’ equal claim to rule by “consent of the governed.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt
These two senses of the famous “all men are created equal” capture the ambiguous quality of the American revolt against the British. It was both a revolutionary and an anticolonial war of independence. The revolutionary spirit was captured in the categorical rejection of monarchy. The anticolonial thrust appears in the assertion of the Americans’ equal claim to rule by “consent of the governed.”<n>More far-reaching than both of these original meanings, however, is the individualist interpretation: All human beings are of equal dignity. They are created equal and remain equal in the eyes of their Creator. There can be no foundation, therefore, for the claim that whites are superior to blacks or that men should count more than women. Of course, many framers of the Declaration were slave owners and most, if not all of them, were patriarchal heads of households. Yet, they bequeathed to the world a rhetorical phrase that was pregnant with meaning deeper than many of them may have intended. This deeper meaning lay, embedded in the text, ready to come alive for the first time as their Declaration became the sacred text of the American abolitionist movement.<n>Legal texts often bear one meaning on their surface and a higher meaning that requires faith and personal investment beyond the surface meaning. A good example is the commandment in the Decalogue prohibiting homicide. Allow me a short digression on the commandment against killing to illustrate the phenomenon of a text that carries one meaning on its surface and a more radical meaning beneath.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt
Gettysburg forged a link between the nation and egalitarian thinking that we sometimes forget. The connection between the limited nation and unbounded equality has paradoxical overtones. The nation is dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. The thrust toward equality has universalist implications. Neither Lincoln in 1863 nor the founders in 1776 argued that only “Americans” were created equal. The claim was that all people—in principle, all human beings on the planet—are born with equal dignity. Yet, this universalistic thinking thins our commitment to equality to a point of fragility.<n>Equality flourishes in an environment of mutual sympathy and reciprocal identification. The love for each and the needs of each come to the fore in the affective bonds of family, friendship, tribe, and, by extension, in the reciprocal attachments of nationhood. The limited political sphere of the nation facilitates the recognition of others as human beings sharing a common history. If blacks and whites, Northerners and Southerners, eventually men and women, could respect each other as Americans participating in the same national drama, they would lay a foundation for affirming their mutual equality. They need not be brothers and not exactly friends, but they could at last recognize each other as compatriots with a common language, a single history, and a shared future.<n>The source for this association between bonds of affection and equality lies outside the Judeo-Christian tradition, notably in the philosophy of the ancient Greeks. The fullest development comes in Aristotle’s Politics and in the Nicomachean Ethics. The idea of universal human equality was foreign to Aristotle, but he did believe in the mutual recognition of equality within the bonds of friendship and other close associations. Indeed, wishing well for the other as an end in himself is an essential component of philia or friendship understood broadly, and this sentiment, Aristotle believed, provides the necessary foundation for all virtuous behavior.11<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt
The invocation of God in the Gettysburg Address is both accidental and entirely predictable. It is accidental in the sense that Lincoln spontaneously added the divine invocation as he neared the end of the address.22 The innovation was predictable. Lincoln’s association of the nation and God derived from his deepest convictions. He thought of Americans as God’s “almost chosen people,” successors to the Jews in a relationship with the Divine that could be described as “almost a covenant.”23 In the mid-nineteenth century, it was relatively easy to believe that we were in the grip of a great historical force, possibly emanating from a higher power. “IN GOD WE TRUST” became a popular motto, appearing for the first time on the nation’s coinage in 1864. Trust in God can generate diverse conclusions, but this does not subtract from the obvious way in which, at the time, faith in God and the Bible nourished the radical claims of human equality.<n>For modern readers, those who do not think instinctively in the idiom of Genesis and the Psalms, it is worth reviewing the kind of argument for equality found in biblical sources. The central idea that generates the concept of universal humanity or universal brotherhood is that we are made in the image of God. As the story has come down to us from Genesis 1, 26, and 27:<n>And God said, Let us make man [Adam] in our own image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, over all the cattle, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. So God created man in his own image, in his own image He created him, male and female He created them.24<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt
This would, admittedly, be an unconventional way of formulating the demands of the Thirteenth Amendment. The usual commentary on the amendment stresses simply that it omits the requirement of action by state officials that we find in the Bill of Rights and in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Yet, it is clear that the postbellum order sought to declare a fundamental value as the symbol of the new United States. The motive was similar to the impulse of the German drafters seeking to ground their postwar constitution in the humanistic values of human dignity. There may be intriguing and important differences between human dignity and autonomy, and we shall return to these later. For now, it is important to note merely that the postbellum legal order begins with a commitment of all state power to eliminate the evil that had cursed the United States since its founding.<n>Significantly, both human dignity and autonomy, both due process and equality, transcend the limits of the nation. It is not only our nationals who are entitled to these basic human rights. All human beings, all persons, should enjoy the same rights—at least so far as they are within the jurisdiction of the state securing those rights. Our commitment to nationhood generates the reciprocal sympathy that enables us to make the move from particular to universal. We may come to understand the meaning of basic rights in the context of the nation but then we are driven to see that all persons, whether members of the nation or not, are entitled to the same treatment.<n>Alternative Readings<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt
Nationhood and Citizenship<n>As much as Lincoln sought to evoke a consciousness of American nationhood, this idea did not readily resonate in the minds of lawyers. The word “nation” was not used in the postbellum amendments. I doubt if it even occurred to counsel for the butchers to come into court and argue that independent tradesmen had a right, granted to them by the American nation, to practice their trade without the duty to pay tolls and use specific facilities. Their rights derived, if from anyplace, from universal principles governing the free market and dignity of working people. Yet, this very argument—that the nation was the source of rights acquired under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments—would show itself, remarkably, in a majestic dissenting opinion in 1883.17<n>The idea of the American nation may have been in the air in the 1870s, but it was not part of the stock of concepts that the Court would draw on directly to domesticate its abstract sense of justice. The concept of an American nation was part of the American creed, but it had yet to become a fixed feature of American law. It enjoyed a fate comparable to the inalienable right to the “pursuit of happiness” as articulated in the Declaration of Independence. The latter is sometimes mentioned in legal opinions,18 but it never became the rationale for decision making in the courts. It remains an article of faith, as does the commitment to think of the American people as a single nation.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
It is clear in this passage that the nation, as distinct from government, creates rights, grants citizenship; it has objectives that it seeks to accomplish, but it must act through the prescribed processes of the law. The nation acts initially in the process of constitutional amendment, and then, by means of delegated authority, through the Congress. The nation has expressed its will by precisely these means in the Reconstruction Amendments, which delegated Congress authority to engage in the kind of legislation under attack in the Civil Rights Cases. The logic of the argument traces the genesis of the nation-state. First the nation comes into being as a prelegal organic unity, and then the nation expresses itself in a governmental structure.<n>One might properly inquire how the idea of the nation’s expressing its will differs from “We the People” acting in concert for the sake of a better government. The differences are admittedly subtle. Perhaps the accent in Justice Harlan’s mind was on the historical bond implied in the war that held the nation together. Yet, it is no accident that the expression “We the People” is absent in the rhetoric of his dissenting opinion. The problem he addressed was not one that the people could decide for themselves. The question “Who constitutes the nation?” does not lend itself to democratic resolution. The question of nationhood logically precedes both government and the popular will. For the nation to express itself as “government of the people,” it must first come into being.<n>The nation does not constitute itself by popular vote or by a decision of government. The nation comes alive, as Lincoln viewed our history, as a bond forged in an historical struggle. The bond was first cast in 1774 with the first stirring of independence or, at the latest, in July 1776. The inclusion of emancipated slaves within the nation came as the only consequence of the Brothers’ War that could make sense of the national search for redemption.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
In recent years, the Secret Constitution has come to assert itself in the opinions, particularly the dissenting opinions, of the Supreme Court. If we are to understand the impact of our implicit postbellum commitment to the ideas of nationhood, democracy, and equality, we cannot limit ourselves to the jurisprudence of the nine justices who happen to sit on the Court in Washington. The Secret Constitution has, in fact, a much deeper grounding in American political and legal culture, and it has come to express itself in diverse arenas. It spontaneously percolates through civil society. It shapes the process of constitutional amendment; indeed, virtually every constitutional amendment enacted since the Civil War expresses, in one way or another, the values of the Secret Constitution. This is true as well of the two leading proposed constitutional amendments that have gained a large political following in the last decade: the proposal to protect the flag against “desecration” and the movement to protect victims of crime. The values of the Secret Constitution have also found their way into subconstitutional federal legislation based, as a technical matter, on the Interstate Commerce Clause, granting Congress authority to regulate commerce “among the states.”1 The earlier defeat in the Supreme Court of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 meant that Congress had to find other means of bringing to bear the same set of values in the pursuit of equal treatment in public facilities and in the workplace. In order to see the resurgence of the three great ideas of the Secret Constitution—nationhood, democracy, and equality—we have to look afield, away from the courts, to these diverse areas that give birth to legal trends and define the bedrock of the American Constitution.2<n>Constitutional Amendments<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
Constitutional Amendments<n>Of all the arenas in which the Secret Constitution has come to the fore, none is more impressive than the process of constitutional amendment. All of the amendments adopted and ratified over the last 135 years reveal the traces of a shared understanding, an unconscious plan, of what American government should be like. This is a remarkable thesis, for the general tendency is to assume that the amendments consist in a hodgepodge of special responses to unrelated problems.<n>The dominant theme is the spread of the franchise and the fine-tuning of the system of democratic representation. But there are other strains from the Secret Constitution as well. As we work our way through the amendments, from the Thirteenth to the Twenty-Seventh, we shall also see a countervailing principle at work. Democracy stresses the responsibility of the people for their self-governance. The offsetting principle is that the government must be strong, well financed, and act with a sense of compassion for the weak and defenseless. Our postbellum commitment to democracy is well known. Less well appreciated is the deep American sense of concern for those who are not able to fend for themselves. The final implication, then, of the Secret Constitution is the commitment of government to the dignity and self-esteem of all its citizens.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt

The final implication, then, of the Secret Constitution is the commitment of government to the dignity and self-esteem of all its citizens.<n>If we think of the Civil War as a moral drama, we cannot but perceive a government at work that is committed to the dignity of all. The drama can be narrowly understood as an enormous sacrifice of human life to liberate people held in the most demeaning condition imaginable. The war snuffed out one life, one being created in the image of God, for every seven slaves freed. There might have been a less costly way of solving the problem. Simply waiting and negotiating, we might have seen the market itself render the keeping of slaves too costly an enterprise. Industrialization spreading South might have made “free labor” a more appealing alternative for those who profited from the system of slave labor. The end of plantation capitalism might have come as safely as the demise of communism in Europe. But these possible scenarios are beside the point. The sacrifice did occur. And we thought it was necessary, as Lincoln preached, to cleanse us of our “offences” and to give the nation a “new birth of freedom.” We could not have survived this drama with anything but a sense that government was capable of a great moral undertaking. Government was no longer instituted simply to keep the peace, deliver the mail, and protect us from foreign enemies but also to ensure that we not descend into the kind of evil that seared the soul of the first American Republic. The period of the Civil War witnessed legislative measures that had never been seen before in the United States—the beginning of a national banking system, the issuance of a national currency, a homestead act that distributed 160 acres to each settler, and land grants for building universities. We incorporated this new understanding of government into the Thirteenth Amendment, which declared boldly that the particular kind of evil that had led to war would never again exist in the United States. To prevent this reoccurrence, the federal government would have to be strong and vigilant. It would have to observe the transactions that occurred in the marketplace to ensure that they did not approach the danger zone of “involuntary servitude.” The war itself and this consequent postbellum policy of necessary vigilance laid the foundation for the later expressions of compassion for the weak and defenseless.<n>From the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Amendment, however, from 1865 to 1870, we can sense a sharp decline in the moral energy of government. Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains, of course, the invocations of “privileges and immunities,” “due process,” and “equal protection” that have engaged the Supreme Court and its academic commentators. But implicit in this 1868 amendment is the resurgence of the states’ responsibility for the events that occur within their borders. And Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the amendment contain time-specific provisions designed to penalize the disloyal states and rebel soldiers and officials. These vengeful provisions have caused much mischief, as we have seen, by providing fodder today for those who prefer denying the franchise to convicted felons.3 Still, the equal protection clause was a breakthrough and supplied the anchor for a cardinal principle of the postbellum legal order. And the due process clause would prove to be the umbrella that would enable the Supreme Court, in the last half-century, to develop a jurisprudence of human rights that applies to the entire country.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
But then the commitment to national pride ran into a contrary trend in American thought that had been in the process of emergence for over a century. The impulse to protect the flag against desecration confronted the rising devotion to the cardinal American value of free speech. Since World War I and the dissenting opinion of Justices Holmes and Brandeis,16 the American recognition of the primacy of free speech has been on an upward trajectory. The Supreme Court, including its most conservative justices, has consistently favored the primacy of speech over the interests of victims injured or offended by the rough and ready rumble of the “marketplace of ideas.”17<n>The collision was inevitable. Two American ideas—protecting the flag and celebrating freedom of speech—would eventually come into focus as contradictory ways of being American. It was a close battle, but in two sharply divided votes of the 1990s, the Supreme Court decided that freedom of expression must prevail.18 But this was hardly a defeat for the politics of national sentiment. Those who loved the flag still had recourse to civil society.19 The proponents of patriotic rituals, such as honoring the flag, could learn from the history of religious sensibility in the United States. The government cannot coerce religious observance without, as John Locke argued in his first Letter Concerning Toleration (1689), corrupting the act of faith into an empty gesture of external compliance. The opposite effect occurs when the government seeks to punish those who burn the flag. The punitive sanction enhances the communicative sting of flag burning. The simple act of destroying a piece of cloth becomes a major event watched closely by the police and the media. The subsequent trial of the flag burner gives him or her a platform for broadcasting the political views expressed in the illegal act. At one time, burning the flag was something like wearing a jacket in the courthouse blazoned with the words “Fuck the Draft.”20 But when flag burning becomes an acceptable and potentially routine event, it draws no more attention than the use of four-letter words at cocktail parties.<n>There is no doubt that free speech has its victims, and in most European societies and in Canada, the courts rush in to protect the victims against being offended. A good example is the way every major jurisdiction outside the United States treats Holocaust denial. Someone publishes a book saying that Auschwitz never happened, that it is a lie propagated by the Jews. This is a punishable act in Germany, France, Israel, the Netherlands, Canada—just about everywhere where people believe that the government must intervene in order to protect those who might be disturbed and offended by the obscene lie. By intervening and putting the Holocaust denier on trial, of course, they only broadcast the lie to a larger audience, and they convert the mad dissident into a martyr in his own circle.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
But we have seen hints of such a theory in the coconstruction of biospheres and econospheres by the self-consistent search of autonomous agents for ways to make a living, the resulting exapting novel ways of making livings, the fact that new adjacent niches for yet further new species grow in diversity faster than the species whose generation creates those new adjacent possible niches, and the search mechanisms to master those modes of being. We have seen a glimmer of something like a fourth law, a tendency for self-constructing biospheres to enlarge their workspace, the dimensionality of their adjacent possible, perhaps as fast, on average, as is possible  glimmers only, not yet well-founded theory nor well-established fact. But glimmers often precede later science.<n>Consider again how the chemical diversity of the biosphere has become more diverse in the past four billion years, urged into its adjacent possible by the genuine chemical potential from the chemical actual into the adjacent possible, where the actual substrates exist and the adjacent possible products do not yet exist. Each time the molecular diversity of the biosphere expands, the set of adjacent possible reactions expands even faster. Recall our simple calculation that for modestly complex organic molecules, any pair of molecules could undergo at least one two substrate–two product reaction. But then the diversity of possible reactions is the square of the diversity of chemicals in the system. As the diversity of molecular species increases, there are always proportionally more novel reactions into the adjacent possible. If we take the formation of a chemical species that has never existed in the biosphere, or perhaps the universe, as a breaking symmetry, then the more such symmetries are broken, the more ways come into existence by which yet further symmetries may be broken.<n>And the chemical case makes clear the linking of the flows of matter and energy in this sprawling chemical diversity explosion. Many such reactions will link exergonic and endergonic processes. As this occurs, energy is pumped from the exergonic partner into the products requiring endergonic synthesis. These products  the chemical diversity in the bark of a redwood tree, for example  take their place in the chemical actual, poising the biosphere, and thus the universe, for its next plunge into the chemical adjacent possible.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt
The Complexity of the Universe<n>Why the universe is complex rather than simple is, in fact, beginning to emerge as a legitimate and deep question. In the past several years, I have had the pleasure to come to know Lee Smolin, whose career is devoted to quantum gravity and cosmology. Most of what I shall write in this chapter reflects my conversations and work with Lee and his colleagues, who have been wonderfully welcoming to this biologist. Sometimes outsiders can make serious contributions. Sometimes outsiders just make damned fools of themselves.<n>Caveat lector, but I will continue.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt
But there is an alternative approach to the link between the quantum and the classical worlds. This possible approach is based on the well-established phenomenon of “decoherence.” Decoherence arises when a quantum-coherent Schrödinger wave is propagating and the quantum system interacts with another quantum system having many coupled variables, or degrees of freedom. The consequence can be that the Schrödinger wave function of the first quantum system becomes entangled in very complex ways with the other complex quantum system, which may be thought of as the environment. Rather like water waves swirling into tiny granular nooks and crannies along a rugged fractal beach, the initial coherent Schrödinger equation representing the initial quantum system swirls into tiny and highly diverse patterns of interaction with the quantum system representing the environment. The consequence of this intermixing is decoherence.<n>To understand the core of decoherence, one must understand that the exhibition of interference phenomena, the hallmark of quantum mechanics noted in the double-slit photon experiment, requires that literally all the propagating possible pathways in Feynman’s sum over histories that are to arrive at each point on the photon-counter surface, do in fact arrive at that point. If some fail to arrive, the sum over all histories fails. In eect, if some of the phase information, the core of constructive and destructive interference, has been lost in the maze of interactions of the quantum system with its environment, then that phase information cannot come to be reassembled to give rise to quantum interference.<n>Decoherence is accepted by most physicists. For example, in attempts to build quantum computers that can carry out more than one calculation simultaneously due to the linear features of quantum mechanics, actual decoherence is currently a technical hurdle in obtaining complex quantum calculations.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt
I began this chapter wondering why the universe is complex. In place of the anthropic principle or Lee Smolin’s cosmic selection, I have suggested one possible approach to the choices of the constants of nature by maximizing constructive interference over a sum of all histories through a space of both configurations and laws. Even if that program were to succeed, it does not necessarily yield a complex universe, let alone one poised roughly between expansion and contraction.<n>Might we see ways to understand why the universe is complex? Perhaps, but merely perhaps. I return to the thoughts earlier in this chapter that decoherence requires coupling systems and the loss of phase information. If, in general, complex and high-diversity quantum systems with many coupled degrees of freedom lose phase information when they interact more rapidly than an equal number of simple, low-diversity quantum systems with the same total number of interacting parts, then the comeasuring of entangled quantum systems should tend toward higher complexity, diversity, and classicity. In short, complexity and diversity would beget classicity irreversibly. In turn, this would lead to a preferred tendency toward a lock-in of complexity and diversity. There is a sense in which classical objects are like the constraints on the release of energy that permits work to be done. Classical objects, interacting with quantum objects, lead to decoherence and more classicity. Complex pairs of quantum objects that decohere readily, or classical objects and those quantum objects that are caused to decohere readily when interacting with the classical object, form preferred pairs that tend to decohere, hence become frozen into classicity. We begin to have an image of preferred pairs of quantum systems coupling and decohering, hence, an image of a complex and diverse universe constructing itself as it nonergodically invades the adjacent possible, rather as a biosphere constructs itself. And if more complexity and diversity means more comeasurement and faster decoherence of a wider variety of complex quantum systems, in analogy with the concept that extracting work from increasingly subtle nonequilibrium systems requires increasingly subtle measuring and coupling devices, the universe as a whole may persistently break symmetries as new entities come into existence, and hence expand its diversity, complexity, and classicity as fast as possible.<n>Loose arguments? Yes. Testable? Here and there. Wrong? Probably. Deeply wrong? Maybe not. Does this get the universe to the edge of expansion versus contraction or to a flat universe expanding forever more rapidly? I would love it to be so. Indeed, I would love a view in which matter, energy, and geometry can all interconvert. After all, if geometry, the vacuum, has energy, such interconversion does not seem impossible. Do the considerations of this chapter require detailed models and supporting calculations to be taken as more than the merest suggestions? Absolutely. This chapter, like much of Investigations, is protoscience. But science grows from serious protoscience, and I take Investigations to be serious protoscience.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch10.txt
ecturing in Dublin, one of the twentieth century’s most famous physicists set the stage of contemporary biology during the war-heavy year of 1944. Given Erwin Schrödinger’s towering reputation as the discoverer of the Schrödinger equation, the fundamental formulation of quantum mechanics, his public lectures and subsequent book were bound to draw high attention. But no one, not even Schrödinger himself, was likely to have foreseen the consequences. Schrödinger’s What Is Life? is credited with inspiring a generation of physicists and biologists to seek the fundamental character of living systems. Schrödinger brought quantum mechanics, chemistry, and the still poorly formulated concept of “information” into biology. He is the progenitor of our understanding of DNA and the genetic code. Yet as brilliant as was Schrödinger’s insight, I believe he missed the center. Investigations seeks that center and finds, in fact, a mystery.<n>In my previous two books, I laid out some of the growing reasons to think that evolution was even richer than Darwin supposed. Modern evolutionary theory, based on Darwin’s concept of descent with heritable variations that are sifted by natural selection to retain the adaptive changes, has come to view selection as the sole source of order in biological organisms. But the snowflake’s delicate sixfold symmetry tells us that order can arise without the benefit of natural selection. Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe give good grounds to think that much of the order in organisms, from the origin of life itself to the stunning order in the development of a newborn child from a fertilized egg, does not reflect selection alone. Instead, much of the order in organisms, I believe, is self-organized and spontaneous. Self-organization mingles with natural selection in barely understood ways to yield the magnificence of our teeming biosphere. We must, therefore, expand evolutionary theory.<n>Yet we need something far more important than a broadened evolutionary theory. Despite any valid insights in my own two books, and despite the fine work of many others, including the brilliance manifest in the past three decades of molecular biology, the core of life itself remains shrouded from view. We know chunks of molecular machinery, metabolic pathways, means of membrane biosynthesis = we know many of the parts and many of the processes. But what makes a cell alive is still not clear to us. The center is still mysterious.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
Following an eVort to understand what an autonomous agent might be = which, as just noted, involves the concept of work cycles = I was led to the concepts of work itself, constraints, and work as the constrained release of energy. In turn, this led to the fact that work itself is often used to construct constraints on the release of energy that then constitutes further work. So we confront a virtuous cycle: Work constructs constraints, yet constraints on the release of energy are required for work to be done. Here is the heart of a new concept of “organization” that is not covered by our concepts of matter alone, energy alone, entropy alone, or information alone. In turn, this led me to wonder about the relation between the emergence of constraints in the universe and in a biosphere, and the diversification of patterns of the constrained release of energy that alone constitute work and the use of that work to build still further constraints on the release of energy. How do biospheres construct themselves or how does the universe construct itself?<n>The considerations above led to the role of Maxwell’s demon, one of the major places in physics where matter, energy, work, and information come together. The central point of the demon is that by making measurements on a system, the information gained can be used to extract work. I made a new distinction between measurements the demon might make that reveal features of nonequilibrium systems that can be used to extract work, and measurements he might make of the nonequilibrium system that cannot be used to extract work. How does the demon know what features to measure? And, in turn, how does work actually come to be extracted by devices that measure and detect displacements from equilibrium from which work can, in principle, be obtained? An example of such a device is a windmill pivoting to face the wind, then extracting work by the wind turning its vanes. Other examples are the rhodopsin molecule of a bacterium responding to a photon of light or a chloroplast using the constrained release of the energy of light to construct high-energy sugar molecules. How do such devices come into existence in the unfolding universe and in our biosphere? How does the vast web of constraint construction and constrained energy release used to construct yet more constraints happen into existence in the biosphere? In the universe itself? The answers appear not to be present in contemporary physics, chemistry, or biology. But a coevolving biosphere accomplishes just this coconstruction of propagating organization.<n>Thus, in due course, I struggled with the concept of organization itself, concluding that our concepts of entropy and its negative, Shannon’s information theory (which was developed initially to quantify telephonic traYc and had been greatly extended since then) entirely miss the central issues. What is happening in a biosphere is that autonomous agents are coconstructing and propagating organizations of work, of constraint construction, and of task completion that continue to propagate and proliferate diversifying organization.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
Beyond the brilliance of the core of molecular genetics, we understand much concerning developmental biology. Humans have about 260 diVerent cell types: liver, nerve, muscle. Each is a diVerent pattern of expression of the 80,000 or 100,000 genes. Since the work of François Jacob and Jacques Monod thirty-five years ago, biologists have understood that the protein transcribed from one gene might turn other genes on or oV. Some vast network of regulatory interactions among genes and their products provides the mechanism that marshals the genome into the dance of development.<n>We have come close to Schrödinger’s dream. But have we come close to answering his question, What is life? The answer almost surely is no. I am unable to say, all at once, why I believe this, but I can begin to hint at an explanation. Investigations is a search for an answer. I am not entirely convinced of what lies within this book; the material is too new and far too surprising to warrant conviction. Yet the pathways I have stumbled along, glimpsing what may be a terra nova, do seem to me to be worth serious presentation and serious consideration.<n>Quite to my astonishment, the story that will unfold here suggests a novel answer to the question, What is life? I had not expected even the outlines of an answer, and I am astonished because I have been led in such unexpected directions. One direction suggests that an answer to this question may demand a fundamental alteration in how we have done science since Newton. Life is doing something far richer than we may have dreamed, literally something incalculable. What is the place of law if, as hinted above, the variables and configuration space cannot be prespecified for a biosphere, or perhaps a universe? Yet, I think, there are laws. And if these musings be true, we must rethink science itself.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
Think of a catalytic task space, in which a point represents a catalytic task, where a catalytic task is the binding of a transition state of a reaction. Just as similar molecules can have similar shapes, so too can similar reactions have similar transition states, hence, such reactions constitute similar catalytic tasks. Just as diVerent molecules can have the same shape, so too can diVerent reactions have similar transition states, hence constitute the “same” catalytic task. Just as an antibody can bind to and cover a ball of similar shapes, an enzyme can bind to and cover a ball of similar catalytic tasks. Just as a finite number of balls can cover shape space, a finite number of balls can cover catalytic task space.<n>In short, a universal enzymatic toolbox is possible. Clues that such a toolbox is experimentally feasible come from many recent developments, including the discovery that antibody molecules, evolved to bind molecular features called epitopes, can actually act as catalysts.<n>Catalytic antibodies are obtained exactly as one might expect, given the concept of a catalytic task space. One would like an antibody molecule that binds the transition state of a reaction. But transition states are ephemeral. Since they last only fractions of a second, one cannot immunize with a transition state itself. Instead, one immunizes with a stable analogue of the transition shape; that is, one immunizes with a second molecule that represents the “same” catalytic task as does the transition state itself. Antibody molecules binding to this transition state analogue are tested. Typically, about one in ten antibody molecules can function as at least a weak catalyst for the corresponding reaction.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
There is good evidence that recombination is only a useful search strategy on smooth, highly correlated landscapes, where the high peaks all cluster near one another. Recombination, half airplane–half motorcycle, is a means to look “between” two positions in a high-dimensional space. Then if both points are in the region of high peaks, looking between those two points is likely to uncover further new points of high fitness, or points on the slopes of even higher peaks. Thereafter, further mutation, recombination, and selection can bring the adapting population to successively higher peaks in the high-peaked region of the genotype space. If landscapes are very rugged and the high peaks do not cluster into smallish regions, recombination turns out to be a useless search strategy.<n>But most organisms are sexual. If organisms are sexual because recombination is a good search strategy, but recombination is only useful as a search strategy on certain classes of fitness landscapes, where did those fitness landscapes come from? No one knows.<n>The strange thing about evolution is that everyone thinks he understands it.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
The theorem is correct. In the absence of any knowledge, or constraint, on the fitness landscape, on average, any search procedure is as good as any other.<n>But life uses mutation, recombination, and selection. These search procedures seem to be working quite well. Your typical bat or butterfly has managed to get itself evolved and seems a rather impressive entity. The no-free-lunch theorem brings into high relief the puzzle. If mutation, recombination, and selection only work well on certain kinds of fitness landscapes, yet most organisms are sexual, and hence use recombination, and all organisms use mutation as a search mechanism, where did these well-wrought fitness landscapes come from, such that evolution manages to produce the fancy stuV around us?<n>Here, I think, is how. Think of an organism’s niche as a way of making a living. Call a way of making a living a “natural game.” Then, of course, natural games evolve with the organisms making those livings during the past four billion years. What, then, are the “winning games”? Naturally, the winning games are the games the winning organisms play. One can almost see Darwin nod. But what games are those? What games are the games the winners play?<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt

Naturally, the winning games are the games the winning organisms play. One can almost see Darwin nod. But what games are those? What games are the games the winners play?<n>Ways of making a living, natural games, that are well searched out and well mastered by the evolutionary search strategies of organisms, namely, mutation and recombination, will be precisely the niches, or ways of making a living, that a diversifying and speciating population of organisms will manage to master. The ways of making a living presenting fitness landscapes that can be well searched by the procedures that organisms have in hand will be the very ways of making a living that readily come into existence. If there were a way of making a living that could not be well explored and exploited by organisms as they speciate, that way of making a living would not become populated. Good jobs, like successful jobholders, prosper.<n>So organisms, niches, and search procedures jointly and self-consistently coconstruct one another! We make the world in which we make a living such that we can, and have, more or less mastered that evolving world as we make it. The same is true, I will argue, for an econosphere. A web of economic activities, firms, tasks, jobs, workers, skills, and learning, self-consistently came into existence in the last forty thousand years of human evolution.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
Well, let’s have at it. I begin with the cornerstone of thermodynamics, the Carnot cycle.<n>Sadi Carnot was a French engineer writing in the 1830s. The French had recently lost the Napoleonic Wars, Waterloo had come and gone, a certain famous statue to Wellington had been erected in London. Carnot, like others at the time, realized that part of the success achieved by the English had to do with early industrial economic power. The Brits had large numbers of steam pumps that were able to clear water from coal and iron mines, allowing miners to work under bad but relatively dry conditions and extract coal and iron more eVectively than could their French counterparts. The coal and iron in turn were worked into the machinery of the Industrial Revolution and cannons and also, notably, more steam pumps that could keep the mines in working condition. I find it fascinating that the British system was an autocatalytic technology, iron and coal fueled the manufacture of pumps that abetted the mining of iron and coal.<n>Carnot set about understanding the fundamentals of the extraction of mechanical work from thermal energy sources. The result of his eVort was an analysis of an idealized device to extract mechanical work from heat, the Carnot cycle. Carnot titled his work “An Investigation on the Motive Force of Heat.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
The first question I want to raise about the Carnot cycle is this: Why is it a “cycle”? There is a clear sensible answer. The Carnot cycle operates in a cycle, as does a steam engine, gasoline engine, or electric motor, precisely because at the completion of one cycle the total system is returned to the same initial state as at the start of the cycle. Because of this, the organization of the process, achieved by the actual gears, rods, and escapements that coordinate the relative motion of the parts of the engine, has returned to the initial configuration from which, with no further ado, the system can again perform a work cycle. Thus in the case of the Carnot engine, the system performs mechanical work on the piston in a work cycle that, in net, transfers heat from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir. At the end of the cycle, the Carnot engine returns to the initial state with the piston raised and filled with hot compressed gas at the temperature of the hot reservoir. The Carnot engine is all set as a total organization to receive another input of heat energy and perform another work cycle.<n>Suppose that there were no cycle? For example, a cannon fires a cannonball that hits a standing steel beam that is knocked over and hits a lever arm tossing a ball on its opposite end into the air which then falls to the ground and stops. To get the contraption to do it again would require that somehow the cannon be reloaded, the steel beam be reset on end, the lever arm to be reset with a ball on its other end. Where is all this organization of processes and events to come from? I will return to these issues in the next chapter, but notice for now that the cyclic organization of processes in the Carnot, the steam, the gas, and the electric engines achieve the requisite organization precisely because the system works as a cyclic process.<n>A second issue concerns a well-known feature of the Carnot engine that is very much worth comment here. If the sequence of steps is run in the reverse directions, so that the engine is run from state 1 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1, the Carnot engine is not performing as a pump at all. It is, instead, performing as a refrigerator. Run in the reverse direction, the Carnot engine uses mechanical work to pump heat from the cool reservoir, T2, to the hot reservoir, T1, making T2 cooler.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
The third point, of course, concerns spontaneous processes and nonspontaneous processes. It took more than fifty years from Carnot’s work to really begin to understand thermodynamics = the first law, conservation of energy; the famous and mysterious second law and its handmaiden, entropy; the third law concerning a zero temperature at which molecular motions stop = and for the invention of statistical mechanics to connect thermodynamics and Newtonian mechanics.<n>Some processes occur spontaneously, some conceivable processes do not. One of the most obvious cases is that if a hot gas is in contact with a cold gas, the two will in due course come to be the same temperature. Heat spontaneously “diVuses” from the hot to the cold object, cooling the former, warming the latter. In statistical mechanics we think of “hot” as corresponding to atoms moving rapidly, hence, with high kinetic energy. When these high-kinetic-energy atoms interact with slower-moving sets of atoms, the collisions transfer kinetic energy to the slower-moving atoms, speeding them up and slowing down the faster-moving atoms. Eventually, the atoms in the two sets come to have the same statistical distribution of motions, hence kinetic energy and hence temperature, where “temperature” is now understood to correspond to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the system.<n>The apparently mysterious second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system is either constant or increases. The modern understanding of entropy can be stated roughly with the help of the concept of a 6N-dimensional phase space.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Well, of course, the winning natural games are the games the winners play. But what natural games are these? The reasonable answer leaps to mind. The winning games must be those that are readily searched out by the very adaptive search procedures used by the coevolving autonomous agents themselves.<n>In short, a biosphere is a self-consistent coevolutionary construction of autonomous agents and ways of making a living that are themselves self-consistently well searched by the search procedures the autonomous agents are using. In colloquial terms, from our experience in economic systems, jobs come into existence with jobholders. If no one can learn or exploit a given kind of job, that sort of job will not be widely populated and will not become diVerentiated into a family of similar jobs.<n>In the biosphere, modes of making a living that are well-searched by mutation and recombination will be populated by many sibling species making their livings by playing slightly diVerent natural games. Those natural games, therefore, proliferate. Ways of making a living that cannot be explored successfully by mutation and recombination will not aVord new niches for many sibling species, so those natural games will not proliferate.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Bluntly in front of us: The closure of catalytic and work tasks in an autonomous agent by which it genuinely constructs a rough second copy from small building blocks by adroit linking of exergonic and endergonic processes. A cell, or colony of cells, is propagating this organization of process.<n>My aim in the current chapter is to begin to investigate what we might mean, and hence see, by propagating organization. No easy journey, this. I will begin with Maxwell’s demon and why measurement of a system only pays in a nonequilibrium setting. In a nonequilibrium setting, the measurements can be stored and used to extract work from the measured system. Maxwell’s demon is the clearest place in physics where matter, energy, and information come together. Yet, we will find the demon and his eorts at measurement tantalizingly incomplete: You see, only some features of a nonequilibrium system, if measured, reveal displacements from equilibrium from which work can, in principle, be extracted. Other features, even if measured, are useless for detecting such energy sources from which work can be extracted. Thus, whatever the demon’s eorts, there remain the issues of just what features of a nonequilibrium system the demon must measure such that work can be extracted, how the demon knows to measure those features rather than other useless features, and how, once measured, couplings come into existence in the universe that actually extract work. Not good enough, I shall say, to assert that in principle, work can be extracted. How does work come to be extracted?<n>A simple example of a device that detects displacements from equilibrium and extracts work is a windmill. The vane on the windmill in eect measures the direction of the wind and pivots the windmill such that its fan blades are perpendicular to the wind. In turn, the wind does work on the blades, causing the windmill to rotate. The system as a whole measures a deviation from equilibrium (here, the direction of the wind), orients the entire system such that extraction of work by the wind is possible for the device, and it actually extracts work. The windmill turns.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
The universe as a whole  from galaxies to planetary systems, and certainly our and any other biospheres  is filled with entities that measure displacements from equilibrium that are sources of energy, those entities actually do extract work. Think of the teeming busyness of a coevolving mixed microbial community of long ago, successfully linking exergonic and endergonic reactions fired by the sun and other high-energy sources. That community measured displacements from equilibrium, extracted work, and inhabited Manhattan three billion years ago, literally building high-rise microbial mat ecosystems. Its microbial descendants are constructing similar high-rise structures in the Sea of Cortez and on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia today.<n>Where did all this come from, this measuring of useful displacements from equilibrium from which work can be extracted, the devices coupling to such measurements, and the extraction of work used to build up new kinds of devices that measure new kinds of displacements from equilibrium to extract work in new ways? Yet a biosphere, actually constructing itself up from sunlight, water, and a small diversity of chemical compounds, does all this over evolutionary time. The biosphere does achieve persistent measuring of displacements from equilibrium from which work can be extracted and does discover “devices” to couple to those energy sources such that work can be extracted.<n>And since the biosphere does this, and the biosphere is part of the universe, then the universe does it. This coming into existence of self-constructing ecosystems must, somehow, be physics. Thus, it is important that we have no theories for these issues in current physics. The stark fact that a biosphere builds up this astounding complexity and diversity suggests that our current physics is missing something fundamental. A biosphere becomes complex, the universe becomes complex. I will argue that the very diversity and complexity of a biosphere begets its further diversification and complexification. I strongly suspect that the same is true of the universe as a whole. The universe’s very diversity and complexity begets its further diversification and complexification.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt

The universe’s very diversity and complexity begets its further diversification and complexification.<n>After exploring Maxwell’s demon, I will ask a physicist’s question, What is work? Physicists have an answer  work is force acting through distance  given by a single number, or scalar, representing the sum of the force acting through the distance. But it will turn out that in any specific case of work, the specific process is organized in some specific way. Work is more than force acting through distance; it is, in fact, the constrained release of energy, the release of energy into a small number of degrees of freedom. It is the constraints themselves  with, as Phil Anderson points out, a kind of rigidity  that largely constitute the organization of the process. But  and here will be the hook  in many cases it takes work to construct the constraints themselves. So we will come to a terribly important circle, work is the constrained release of energy, but it often takes work to construct the constraints.<n>A conceptual cluster lies at the heart of the mystery. The cluster concerns the progressive emergence of organization in the evolution of the physical universe and of a biosphere. That emerging organization concerns the appearance in the evolving universe of entities measuring relevant rather than nonrelevant properties of nonequilibrium systems, by which they identify sources of energy that can perform work. Then physical entities appear that construct constraints on and couplings to the release of the identified source of energy whereby the energy is actually released and work comes to be performed. Such work often comes to be used to construct further detectors of energy sources and entities that harbor constraints on the release of energy, which when released constitutes work that constructs still further sources of energy and constraints on its release. It should be clear that we have at present no theories about these matters, nor even a clear concept of the subject matter of such theories.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt

This is what lies directly before us but which we have not been able to see. A biosphere does all the above. Ours has for four billion years of awesome, ill-understood creativity. Doubt it? Open your eyes and look around you.<n>The universe, since the big bang, was and remains out of equilibrium, or vastly nonequilibrium. It was a profound insight in the development of equilibrium thermodynamics to recognize that the energy present in the thermal motions of an equilibrium gas system could not be extracted to do work. But we might ask a similar question of the nearly featureless, profound nonequilibrium of the early universe. How, in the absence of specific structures and processes, could the nonequilibrium universe couple that enormous energy to the specific generation of anything at all? Part of the answer lies in the concept of broken symmetries. Consider a pole standing vertically on a horizontal plane. In due course, it will fall over under the influence of gravity. Prior to falling, its range of possible directions to fall is the full circle. After it falls, it points in some specific direction. By falling, the pole has broken the circular symmetry of the system and come to a specific orientation. Thus part of the answer to the emergence of specific structures lies in the expansion and cooling of the universe, with the associated sequences of symmetry breakings that split the four fundamental forces, yielded a quark-gluon soup that cooled into other elementary particles, then atoms, simple molecules, self-gravitating masses, galaxies, giant molecular clouds, and second-generation stars.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt

As the variety increased, the pairwise diversity of matter and processes increased roughly as the square of the diversity. Hence, it became more probable that specific pairs of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes might become linked in a variety of ways, capturing the energy resources of the spontaneous processes that could then flow in constrained ways into the nonspontaneous processes to yield novel consequences. Among those consequences are the construction of new structures able to measure sources of energy. Among the other consequences are the generation of novel and specific nonequilibrium energy sources and of structures and constraints that might couple to those novel specific sources of energy. The couplings and constraints, in turn, channel the release of energy in specific ways that constitutes the work that is done to construct still further novel energy sources, measuring structures, couplings, and constraints. This, in a nutshell, is the universe diversifying, constructing structures and processes, propagating and elaborating wondrous organization.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
More generally, Zurek’s point is that as measurements are performed on a nonequilibrium gas system, the length of the most compact description increases more slowly than the knowledge thus gained reduces the entropy of the system. It pays to measure the nonequilibrium system in the sense that those measurements specify the displacements from equilibrium that constitute energy sources that can be utilized to extract work.<n>So the demon is indeed a place in physics where matter, energy, information, and indeed, work, come together.<n>Let’s consider just how work might actually be extracted in the classical Maxwell demon situation with an ideal gas in two boxes separated by a partition with the window and flap valve. As a simple example, consider again the tiny windmill mentioned above, consisting of a fan and a vane perpendicular to the fan. Let the windmill be located very near the window with the flap valve inside the total gas system. If the flap valve is opened, a wind will pass transiently from the left to the right box. The windmill’s vane will measure the direction of the wind and actually orient the windmill fan blades perpendicular to the wind. The wind will cause the fan to turn, thus the turning fan extracts mechanical work from the system until equilibrium is reached.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
But now we need to pause and reflect, for the story of the demon is both tantalizing and incomplete. Consider again our tiny windmill. What feature of the total gas system was measured and detected such that work could be extracted? Roughly, the wind from the left to the right box.<n>But not all measurements of the two-box system would have resulted in information that was useful, in the sense that work could have been extracted by the actual box in its actual configuration. For example, the box with the flap valve separates the left and right boxes; suppose that there is an identical number of gas molecules in the two equal-sized boxes and that the gas in the left box is hotter than the gas in the right box. Further, suppose the demon measures the number and instantaneous locations of all the gas particles in the left and right boxes. The fact that the particles in the left box are hotter than those in the right box, hence are moving faster than those in the right box, would not be revealed by a measurement of the instantaneous numbers and locations of all the gas particles in the left and right boxes. To measure faster motion, the demon must measure positions at two time moments or some other feature, such as the recoil of the box’s walls from the momentum transferred by the hotter versus cooler gas particles in the left and right boxes as they bounce o the wall. So, just how does the demon decide (Figure .) or come to measure the relevant properties such that an energy source is successfully identified such that work can be extracted?<n>We have, in fact, no answer as yet.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
We see the hints here of something new. Only certain features of a given nonequilibrium system, if measured, will result in detection of sources of energy that might become coupled to specific other processes that, by doing work, propagate macroscopic changes in the universe. Moreover, the tiny windmill is an example of a device that not only detects the wind from the left to the right box, but also orients the fan perpendicular to that wind and has couplings and constraints embodied in its structure such that mechanical work is actually extracted.<n>Fine, but we built the tiny windmill. How do such coupling structures that link identified sources of energy to the carrying out of work come to exist in the universe on their own? There is not the slightest doubt, for example, that such entities have come into existence in our biosphere as autonomous agents have coevolved over the eons. Thus, a host of new questions are raised. In the beginning, presumably, the universe was simple, homogeneous, featureless, almost isotropic. Now it is vastly complex. In the beginning, the early Earth had a paucity of complex molecules, chemical reactions, linked structures and processes. Now it is vastly complex.<n>The universe as a whole has witnessed the coming into existence of novel structures and processes; so too has the biosphere. Where no dierence existed, dierences have come into existence. In a general sense, the persistent emergence of dierent structures and processes is the persistent breaking of the symmetry of the universe. What feeds this apparent propagating diversity? One aspect may be the following. Consider again the case of the box with the flap valve and something simpler than a fan, say a small mica flake suspended in the cooler of the left and right boxes. If the flap valve “be opened,” a wind from the hotter to the cooler box is transiently present. This is a simple displacement from equilibrium, and a simple device, the mica flake, will be made to quake, hence, extract mechanical work.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt

This is a simple displacement from equilibrium, and a simple device, the mica flake, will be made to quake, hence, extract mechanical work.<n>Now consider an antiferromagnetic material. Such material has magnetic dipoles that, when adjacent, prefer to point in opposite directions. The north pole of one prefers to be adjacent to the south poles of its neighbors. If arranged along a straight line, an antiferromagnetic material has two equivalent lowest-energy “ground” states, NSNSNSNSN versus SNSNSNSNS. Now consider a subtle displacement from one of these lowest-energy states, say NNNSNSSSN. Here, rather than alternating N and S poles being next to one another, runs of NNN and SSS occur. The energy of the total system would be lowered if the dipoles flipped orientation to come closer to one or the other of the ground energy states. Therefore, at a suciently low temperature such that the system can flow to and remain at a ground state, the NNNSNSSSN antiferromagnet is displaced from its lowest-energy equilibrium state, and in principle, work could be extracted from this system as it relaxes to one of the two lowest-energy states. But notice now that, compared to detecting the direction of the wind by the mica flake, a rather complex and subtle measurement must be made by any measuring device that is to detect the subtle displacement from equilibrium and that any device that is to use that displacement to extract work must be correspondingly subtle. Roughly speaking, a measuring device must be of similar complexity to the antiferromagnet. Indeed, a second antiferromagnet could serve as a measuring device if it were near its own ground state and brought into proximity to the first antiferromagnet. The runs of SSS and NNN in the first antiferromagnet, brought close to a second one with ground state runs of SNS and NSN could cause the first antiferromagnet to flip closer to its ground states. Hence, the measuring-detecting-extracting device must be more structurally and functionally complex than a mere mica flake considered as a thin planar crystal.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt

One aspect may be the following. Consider again the case of the box with the flap valve and something simpler than a fan, say a small mica flake suspended in the cooler of the left and right boxes. If the flap valve “be opened,” a wind from the hotter to the cooler box is transiently present. This is a simple displacement from equilibrium, and a simple device, the mica flake, will be made to quake, hence, extract mechanical work.<n>Now consider an antiferromagnetic material. Such material has magnetic dipoles that, when adjacent, prefer to point in opposite directions. The north pole of one prefers to be adjacent to the south poles of its neighbors. If arranged along a straight line, an antiferromagnetic material has two equivalent lowest-energy “ground” states, NSNSNSNSN versus SNSNSNSNS. Now consider a subtle displacement from one of these lowest-energy states, say NNNSNSSSN. Here, rather than alternating N and S poles being next to one another, runs of NNN and SSS occur. The energy of the total system would be lowered if the dipoles flipped orientation to come closer to one or the other of the ground energy states. Therefore, at a suciently low temperature such that the system can flow to and remain at a ground state, the NNNSNSSSN antiferromagnet is displaced from its lowest-energy equilibrium state, and in principle, work could be extracted from this system as it relaxes to one of the two lowest-energy states. But notice now that, compared to detecting the direction of the wind by the mica flake, a rather complex and subtle measurement must be made by any measuring device that is to detect the subtle displacement from equilibrium and that any device that is to use that displacement to extract work must be correspondingly subtle. Roughly speaking, a measuring device must be of similar complexity to the antiferromagnet. Indeed, a second antiferromagnet could serve as a measuring device if it were near its own ground state and brought into proximity to the first antiferromagnet. The runs of SSS and NNN in the first antiferromagnet, brought close to a second one with ground state runs of SNS and NSN could cause the first antiferromagnet to flip closer to its ground states. Hence, the measuring-detecting-extracting device must be more structurally and functionally complex than a mere mica flake considered as a thin planar crystal.<n>The linked exergonic and endergonic organic chemistry reactions present in the molecular autonomous agents that we call cells exemplify just this structural and functional subtlety. The electric charge distribution on two complex organic molecules brought into proximity, coupled with the modes of translational, vibrational, and rotational motions, constitute the subtle means to measure displacements from equilibrium, couple to those displacements, and achieve linked catalyzed exergonic and endergonic reactions. As the molecular diversity of the biosphere increases, more such molecular species displaced from equilibrium come into existence, more such molecular species able to detect such displacements from equilibrium come into existence, more such coupled catalyzed exergonic and endergonic reactions come into existence.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt

In turn, the very existence of sets of these increasingly diverse and complex entities gives them an increased number of ways, and so an increased probability, to couple with one another such that one may measure a displacement from equilibrium of the other; hence, these entities happen upon a source of energy that can be and is extracted to do work. In turn, that work may drive nonspontaneous processes to create still more complex molecular species or other entities in the adjacent possible.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt

If there is a relation such that diverse and complex features of nonequilibrium systems useful as sources of energy can best be detected by equally diverse and complex structures, then there appears to be some generalized “autocatalytic” set of processes in the universe since the big bang, and in a biosphere, by which nonequilibrium systems of increasing complexity and diversity arise, provide sources of energy of increasing subtlety and complexity, and in turn are detected and extracted by the increasingly complex structures that arise.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
I shall proceed in steps. First, let’s just consider the physicist’s definition of work as the integral of force acting through distance. The physicist has in mind something like Newton’s laws, where F = MA. And we understand distance, plain old nonrelativistic distance. So the work done is given by just adding up little increments of the force acting on a mass and accelerating it through a distance.<n>But already there is a bit of a puzzle. In any specific case of work done, some direction of application of force is specified in three-dimensional space, some actual direction of motion of the mass is specified in three-dimensional space, and some actual coupling mechanism is in place such that the force does act on the mass and get it to accelerate in that direction. How does the “specification” of a direction come to be? How does the organization of the specific case of work come about?<n>Now in normal physics, say, college-level physics, all these specifications occur at the beginning of the problem, in the statement of the initial and boundary conditions. The billiard balls are in such and such positions on the billiard table, the cue is moved with such and such velocity and strikes a given ball in such and such a position with such and such velocity. Now, given Newton’s calculus, let us compute the forward trajectory of the balls on the table. So the puzzle of where the initial and boundary conditions come from, and the specific coupling of cue to ball, are “hidden” in the initial and boundary conditions of “the problem” and in how Newton taught us to calculate. In short, the problem of the organization of the process in any specific case of work is hidden from view in the initial and boundary conditions of the usual statement of the physical problem. In eect, this choice is the choice of the “relevant” degrees of freedom, which is equivalent to the choice of the boundary conditions versus the dynamical variables of the system.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt

We will return in a subsequent chapter to ask if it makes sense to try to finitely prestate the initial and boundary conditions of a biosphere. I will claim that it does not. I will claim that we cannot finitely prespecify the configuration space of a biosphere, hence, we cannot finitely prespecify the initial and boundary conditions of a biosphere.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
Let’s take a second look at work. Consider an isolated thermodynamic system. At equilibrium the system can do no work. But let the system be partitioned into two or more domains, say, by a membrane. Ah, then one part of the system can do work on the other part. For example, if the average pressure in one part is higher than in another part, the first part can bulge the membrane into the second part.<n>Where did the membrane come from? How does the system come to be partitioned? Is this just another initial or boundary condition hiding from view the question: Where did this organization of stu and process come from? Meanwhile, note that the concept of work appears to require that the universe be partitioned. Regions of the universe must be distinguished (by what or whom?) such that work manages to happen.<n>Now I come to a definition I like, due to Atkins in his book on the second law. Atkins defines work as “the constrained release of energy.” Work is, says Atkins, a “thing.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt

What are the constraints? The cylinder and the piston, the position of the piston in the cylinder, the grease between the piston and cylinder are constraints. These roughly suce, together with the hot gas compressed in the cylinder head, for work to happen as the hot gas expands and pushes on the piston.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt

In actual fact, in the current case some human, or some machine made by a human, did work to construct the cylinder, the piston, assemble the piston into the cylinder with working gas and grease in place. Then more work was done to compress and heat the gas by pushing on the piston from the outside.<n>So we appear to come to an interesting circle.

Does it often take work to construct constraints? Yes. In those cases, the work done to construct constraints is, in fact, another coupling of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes. But this is just what we are suggesting must occur in autonomous agents. In the universe as a whole, exploding from the big bang into this vast diversity, are many of the constraints on the release of energy that have formed due to a linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes? Yes. What might this be about? I’ll say it again. The universe is full of sources of energy. Nonequilibrium processes and structures of increasing diversity and complexity arise that constitute sources of energy and that measure, detect, and capture those sources of energy, build new structures that constitute constraints on the release of energy, and hence drive nonspontaneous processes to create more such diversifying and novel processes, structures, and energy sources.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
And what of ethics? Does a whi of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents? Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent. There are deep reasons for caution. Hume told us long ago about the “naturalistic fallacy”: One cannot deduce “ought” from “is.” From the fact that mothers care for their young, we cannot deduce that they ought to do so, Hume argued. From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry, we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so.<n>Indeed, Hume’s injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements. We scientists find the facts. You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics. But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is, where do values come from at all? Hume’s injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category “ought.”<n>The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long, twisted, arduous. Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful, philosophers as famous as G. E. Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances. “It is wrong to kill.” Becomes, “Agggah!” Does the positivist argument seem persuasive? It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists, “only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful,” is itself not empirically verifiable. One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt
John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all “contractually” agree to, were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments. Thus “equality before the law” is one contract that Rawls commends to us. “Equality before the law” is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium. The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue.<n>I will content myself with wondering where “value” and the rudiments of “intentionality” come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts. Where is the place of value in a world of fact?<n>So, a short soliloquy. Facts are know-that statements. But know-how preceded know that. While fully aware of Hume’s injunction, I think that from the autonomous agent’s perspective, yuck or yum is primary, unavoidable, and of the deepest importance to that agent. I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria. Too much yuck, this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere. Without attributing consciousness to an E. coli, or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future, I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch5.txt
But life has burgeoned beyond single-celled creatures. The sea is filled with eukaryotic colonial organisms = multicellular, usually capable of sexual reproduction but also capable of asexual reproduction by budding clumps of cells that reform the various organs, feeding tubes, mouths, stinging cells, musculature, nerve system. Blessed proliferating profusion of ways of being.<n>And of course, since about 1.6 billion years ago, and surely since the Ediacrin 600 million years ago, and the Cambrian period 540 million years ago, there have come to exist us multicellular sexually reproducing juggernauts.<n>Tyrannosaurus rex really was a juggernaut of an autonomous agent. A blue whale isn’t so trifling either. Neither is the wide-flung stand of aspen astride the hillsides above Santa Fe, largest single stand of aspen in the United States, presumably all or most of which is a linked set of trees sprouting from the spreading roots of some initial individual. Julius Rebek, a chemist now at the Scripps Institute, is fond of saying that the biggest molecule he knows of is Number 7 Illinois coal, a massive hunk of coal several miles long and wide and hundreds of feet deep. Maybe Number 7 Illinois coal is from a single, clonally linked stand of aspen cousins.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
It is important to stress an obvious feature of the biosphere, in contrast to the algorithmic computational systems of Fontana, Ray, and others. The algorithmic systems manipulate symbols according to discrete, well-defined transformation rules, a kind of algebra-mapping symbols or symbol strings into symbol strings.<n>In contrast, the biosphere is built up of the doings, the embodied know-how, carryings on of autonomous agents = real physical molecular systems grafting a flow of matter and energy, constraint construction, and organization into their persistent coevolution. As we will see below = where I give grounds to think that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere, hence cannot prestate the adaptations that may come to exist in an evolving biosphere = real macroscopic physical systems that are autonomous agents may not be constrained in what they can produce, as is a formal mathematical algebraic symbol system. If so, then the “algorithmic freedom” of a biosphere is deeply important, for the science of Newton, Einstein, and Bohr all suppose prediction by algorithmic calculation.<n>Indeed, I suspect that the persistent innovations in a biosphere stem in no small measure from the fact that while we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere, the categories relevant to its unfolding novel functionalities, the biosphere is not hampered by our failure at categorization. Unlike the well-defined and formal transformation rules of an algebra or a calculational process such as lisp, the transformation rules of the biosphere enlarge and change in ways that cannot be prespecified. As concrete examples, consider the evolution of the genetic code and consider the structure of eukaryotic chromosomes, whose complex coordinated behaviors underlie both normal mitotic cell division and the astonishing sequence of meiotic reduction cell divisions in which maternal and paternal homologue chromosomes synapse, undergo recombination, and separate such that the final sperm or egg cell receives, at random, only one homologue of each parental chromosome. The emergence of these complex macromolecular systems has altered the way evolution itself unfolds.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
But I find myself troubled by this view and will provide an example of why. Millions of years ago, the last female trilobite, Tomasina, was hurrying to find a good place to lay her eggs. Suddenly, Tomasina saw a hideous starfish, named Darthvader, dead ahead. “Left or right? What shall I do?” she wondered. Tomasina jumped left. Darthvader jumped right, caught Tomasina, killed her, and devoured her and her eggs.<n>There are no more trilobites. Moreover, when Tomasina died, she took with her the unique proteins and small molecules that were trilobite molecular species. These kinds of molecules are gone from the biosphere. So too are descendant mutant molecules that might have arisen from further speciation from Tomasina’s tribe. Furthermore, other chemical reactions, which might have been catalyzed transforming some molecular species to others that Tomasina’s molecules and those of her descendants might have catalyzed, have perhaps never come to be in the biosphere that has evolved over the succeeding eons.<n>Now, Tomasina is lost as an entire organism acting in an environment. Yet the causal consequences of her wrong guess of direction to jump have propagated downward to lower levels of organization, namely the molecular species of which the biosphere is composed.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
It is precisely this point, that the function of a part of an organism is a subset of its causal consequences, to which I appealed earlier in stating that in an autonomous agent discerning the work task done by the constrained release of energy required finding the subset of causal consequences of that work task that were functionally important to the life cycle of the autonomous agent in its environment and, therefore, were presumably selected and sustained by natural selection. My point was that we cannot know the functions of parts except in the context of the whole autonomous agent in its environment.<n>But now we come to a more radical issue, Darwinian preadaptations, or in Stephen J. Gould’s term, “exaptations.” Darwin noted that in an appropriate environment a causal consequence of a part of an organism that had not been of selective significance might come to be of selective significance and hence be selected. Thereupon, that newly important causal consequence would be a new function available to the organism.<n>Take a fanciful case in point. The human heart not only makes heart sounds, but it also is a set of resonant chambers. Suppose you were in Los Angeles, felt something odd in your chest, and thought, “My God! An earthquake!” You did whatever the right thing was and survived, alone among millions. Your heart happened to be preadapted to pick up earthquake pretremors. Now suppose you marry and have children who inherit your fatefully preadapted heart, and suppose earthquakes arose often enough for this new capacity to oVer survival advantage to you and your oVspring. Soon a subspecies of Homo sapiens would arise with earthquake detectors in their chest. Not bad.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
Now, evolution by such preadaptations, or exaptations, are not rare; they are the grist of adaptive evolution. Thus arose the lung, the ear, flight, presumably most major adaptations and presumably many or even all minor ones as well. It suYces for my purposes that many adaptations arise as Darwin’s preadaptations, or Gould’s exaptations.<n>Here now is my troublesome question. Do you think that you could state, ahead of time, all the possible causal consequences of bits and pieces of organisms that might in some odd circumstances or another turn out to be preadaptations and hence be selected and come to exist in the biosphere? Stated more starkly, do you think that you can finitely prestate all the context-dependent causal consequences of parts of all possible organisms that might be preadaptations, hence be selected and come to exist in the biosphere?<n>I believe, and it is a matter of central importance if I am correct, that the answer is no. I do not think it is possible to finitely prestate all the context-dependent causal consequences of parts of creatures that might turn out to be useful in some weird environment and hence be selected. I’m not yet certain how to prove that this is not possible, although I will have a try at it below.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
On the other hand, there may be a parallel between the exaptations of which we have spoken and Godel’s theorem and the augmentation of the axiom set such that formerly unprovable statements become provable. That is, the emergence of novel exaptations in evolution do seem rather like the emergence of novel primitive objects and primitive control operations = hence, novel axioms. In the examples above, the emergence of the genetic code and the emergence of chromosomes that duplicate and partition daughter chromosomes into two daughter cells, the evolution of controlled recombination, seem to become instantiated as “biological laws,” even though they are entirely historically contingent. Changing the biological laws in evolution seems rather like the generation of a novel axiom from which new consequences can be derived.<n>On this interpretation, my claim that we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere becomes the claim that the biosphere keeps generating new “causal axioms” from which it generates novel forms. Then just as we do not know where the new axioms of a formal system come from, save as the free invention of the logician involved, so it would seem that we cannot prestate the new generative exaptations that allow evolution to drive in new directions. I am not entirely persuaded by this analogy to finding ever new axioms in Godel’s theorem, but it does have some coherence.<n>Indeed, the failure to be able to prestate the configuration space of the biosphere may be yet deeper. I will take a stab at a proof. I begin by vitiating my assumption that one cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere, then try to show that the implications are that the number of potentially relevant properties is vastly hyperastronomical and that there is no way in the lifetime of the universe for any knower within the universe to enumerate, let alone work with, all the possible properties or categories and their causal consequences.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
Physicist Richard Feynman noted that equilibrium is when “all the fast things have happened, and the slow ones have not.” His dictum suggests, accurately, that the notion of equilibrium is not quite so self-evident.<n>The aim of the current chapter is to explore the profound failure, on the scale of a suciently large closed thermodynamic system and, a fortiori, the open system of the biosphere, to come close to equilibrium on vastly long time scales with respect to the lifetime of the universe. The main facts are known to physicists, of course. The universe is vastly nonergodic above modest levels of molecular complexity, let alone with respect to gross motions of parts of the universe with respect to one another.<n>Given that the universe is actually nonergodic, nonrepeating, and in macroscopically important ways, over a time scale vastly longer than the lifetime of the universe, we are entitled to broach the question of whether there might be general laws governing some or all aspects of this nonergodic behavior. No one knows, but I will raise a possibility that has a chance to be true for a biosphere. There is little harm in wondering if it might hint at a fourth law of thermodynamics for self-constructing systems such as biospheres.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
Let that sink in. It would take at least to the th times the current lifetime of the universe for the universe to manage to make all possible proteins of length at least once. Obviously, with respect to proteins of length the universe is vastly nonergodic. It cannot have equilibrated over all these possible dierent molecules.<n>At a level of complexity above atomic nuclei, once into the realm of complex molecules, the universe will not, cannot, come to equilibrium, on vastly long timescales compared to its historical age. Indeed, the giant cold molecular clouds in galaxies, about degrees absolute in temperature, are highly complex mixtures of molecular species, many carbonaceous, as well as the birthplace of stars. We will return in a moment to wonder about whether a galaxy, considered as a closed thermodynamic system, reaches equilibrium chemically.<n>What about the arbitrary restriction to a femtosecond? The fastest known timescale is the Planck timescale, one in to the rd parts of a second, or seconds. At the Planck timescale, therefore, the universe can have created at most proteins of length compared to such proteins. It would take the known universe, chunking along on the Planck timescale, times its current lifetime to make all proteins of length .<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
This nonergodicity is puzzling. Just what, for example, does this mean with respect to the second law stating that thermodynamically isolated chemical systems approach equilibrium and their entropy increases to a maximum? In the familiar setting of a liter of gas at room temperature, equilibrium of macroscopic features is attained rapidly, and small macroscopic fluctuations such as deviation from chemical equilibrium among a fixed set of molecular species damp out fairly rapidly. By contrast, consider a giant cold molecular cloud in a spiral galaxy with about a hundred million solar masses; ignore gravitational eects and just consider the ongoing complex chemical reactions on the complex dust particles that exist in those clouds. The specific molecular configurations that arise almost certainly include molecular species that are ever unique in the history of the universe. If we may consider unique molecular species as macroscopic features of the cloud, then these fluctuations in macroscopic properties do not damp out; rather, they form the nexus for the generation of still new, unique molecular species. A specific cloud, like our biosphere, presumably becomes kinetically trapped into a very special set of complex molecular species that happen to have formed as the cloud evolves.<n>In short, since the relevant timescale for the ergodic hypothesis to hold is vastly longer than the actual present history of the universe, the macroscopic features of the universe with respect to the specific sets of complex molecules that exist on this planet  in giant cold molecular clouds, and so forth  are kinetically trapped into an infinitesimal subset of those molecular species that might have come into existence in an ensemble of dierent histories of the universe.<n>My quip above about the nonergodicity of the universe with respect to species, languages, legal systems, and Chevrolet trucks was not a jest. We noted in the previous chapter that autonomous agents can form hierarchies  hypercycles made of replicators linked in a cycle of mutual benefit are but the simplest case. The symbiotic construction of eukaryotic cells by merging of dierent bacterial forms to create mitochondria and chloroplasts and perhaps cell nuclei are another case. So too are multicelled organisms such as starfish and ourselves. These hierarchically complex autonomous agents have, do, and will invade an adjacent possible, definable at least at the chemical level, but also on morphological levels, behavioral levels, and beyond. At all levels, the biosphere has been invading a persistent adjacent possible for . billion years.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
I am fond of telling the Noah’s Vessel experiment, hypothetical though it is. I ask, thereby, whether the biosphere is supracritical. Take two of every species, all hundred million of them, male and female, normalizing a bit for mass (so you have small bits of hippos and elephants per fly). Dump them all into a large blender and homogenize the hell out of them, breaking all tissue and cell boundaries, spilling out the stu of life into a common, homogenized liquor.<n>The small molecule diversity in the blender is presumably on the order of billions, the protein and polymer diversity is on the order of hundreds of trillions, thus . Assuming that any pair of molecular species can undergo at least one two substrate–two product reaction, the total number of reactions is, as noted above, the square of the molecular diversity, so is about . If the probability that any one protein species catalyzes any one reaction is, say, one in a trillion, or , then the expected number of catalyzed reactions is just the product of the number of reactions times the number of potential protein catalysts, divided by the probability that a given protein catalyzes a given reaction. This yields reactions times proteins divided by , which equals . In short, virtually all possible reactions will be catalyzed by something. Indeed, on average, each possible reaction will find dierent protein catalysts. A vast sustained explosion into the adjacent possible would occur. Ergo, the biosphere is supracritical. More precisely, the biosphere would be supracritical if all molecular species could be in eective contact with one another on short timescales. But all molecular species do not come in contact with one another willy-nilly, for molecular species are packaged into cells.<n>It is critical to note that individual cells are not supracritical. The crude argument says that a cell’s metabolism has about organic molecules. Consider squirting a novel molecule, Q, into a cell. Presumably Q can be one member of two substrates with each of these organic molecules. Thus, addition of Q to the cell aords about novel reactions. Let the protein diversity of the cell be bounded by the human number of genes at ,. Any such protein has evolved for some tasks, but may contain molecular nooks and crannies that can serve as novel catalytic sites. The expected number of novel catalyzed reactions due to the presence of Q is given by the product of the number of potential protein catalysts times the number of novel reactions made available by injection of Q into the cell, divided by the probability that any protein catalyzes any given reaction. The product of potential catalysts (the proteins) and the reactions is ,,, or . The best current guess at the probability that a randomly chosen protein catalyzes a randomly chosen reaction comes from the probability that a monoclonal antibody canalyzes a reaction and, as discussed above, is about one in a billion. If so, the expected number of the novel reactions that will be catalyzed when Q is squirted into a cell is ,, divided by ,,,, or .. Since . is less than , on average, no chains of novel reactions are catalyzed and cells are subcritical.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
Candidate Laws for the Coconstruction of a Biosphere<n>or the purpose of our discussion here, grant that molecular autonomous agents propagate organization and evolve by the roughly familiar Darwinian aegis of mutation and selection. These agents  coevolving with one another, discovering displacements from equilibrium that can be used to accomplish work, making records of such sources of energy, then linking those exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions  are the means by which our biosphere has come into being, actually coconstructed by the activities, accidents, striving, and failures of these autonomous agents, exapting persistently into their adjacent possible.<n>Yes. But how does a biosphere get itself constructed? Are there laws? Are there laws that might hold for any biosphere? Laws of a general biology, wherever autonomous agents swirl into existence and change forever the begetting of the universe?<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
It may be that Welsh has found the first evidence of genes lying in eight dierent green islands, buered from one another by the percolating red frozen structure. If the green islands exist, they are the paragraph structure of the genome. They are the midsize decision-taking subcircuits of the genome. For each such island, cut o from influence by other islands by the frozen red structure, has its own alternative attractors, two for this island, five for that island, seven for a third island. The total number of attractors for the entire network is then x x = . And if so, cell types are a kind of combinatorial code of the choices made by the dierent islands.<n>And yet more: My colleague Marc Ballivet, with a minor bit of help from me, has come up with a means to rapidly clone most or all cis sites from cells. If the thousands of cis sites can be cloned, each can be used to anity purify the trans factors binding it. Other biologists are learning how to construct small genetic circuits. By our means or others, the medicine of the twenty-first century will learn to control the activities of genes in genetic networks, hence, control tissue regeneration and dierentiation. We enter the “postgenomic” era.<n>I return to my candidate law and remark next that cells typically do not live alone; they live in communities of single-celled organisms or other simple multicellular organisms, or they live in tissues in highly complex multicellular organisms. Thus, any candidate law must be considered with respect to a community of autonomous agents.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
Consider an ecosystem with dierent species of bacteria. Each species may secrete dierent chemical species, S, that impinge on a subset, C, of the other cell species. In Figure . I show a three-dimensional coordinate system. One axis shows the order-chaos axis for a single isolated bacterium, measured by Derrida curve criteria, with order on the left, near the origin, and chaos on the right. The remaining axes show C and S.<n>If a given cell is at the phase transition between order and chaos, and additional molecular inputs, S per cell, come from C dierent types of cells, the total connectivity in the cell is raised from KN to KN + CS. The results will typically drive that cell into the chaotic regime. Indeed, the entire community will be driven into the chaotic regime.<n>Hence, in the coordinate system of Figure ., Igor Yakushin at Bios Group has shown that a hyperbolic surface, as shown, separates the ordered regime from the chaotic regime. Cells can buer themselves from chemical perturbations from other species by retreating deeper into the ordered regime. This can be accomplished by increasing the number of canalyzing inputs per gene. And indeed, as described above, individual eukaryotic cells do appear to lie well within the ordered regime, perhaps as buering for the fact that such cells, like yeast, live in microbial communities or, like human cells, live in tissues where each cell is bombarded with chemical signals from other cells in the same body.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt

The hypothesis is readily tested. If so, perturbations of a single gene in one type of cell should trigger a power law distribution of avalanches of changes of gene activities that spreads from the perturbed gene to other genes in that cell and species, and to cells of other species. Further, the Derrida curve of the total community should be at the phase transition.<n>A final numerical test is under way. The aim of the numerical test is to check whether cells and communities that lie at the phase transition would, in fact, make the maximum number of reliable discriminations and act without trembling hands.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
More rarely, there are mutants of rather dramatic eect, none more so than the famous homeotic mutants of Drosophila, which fascinated me and many others. Here a single mutant can change an antenna into a leg or an eye to a wing or a head to the genitalia. These survive perfectly well in the laboratory as well, but one expects would not fare well in the real world.<n>Therefore, most of the heritable variation cast up by mutation is of minor eect, and gradual variation is persistent grist for the selection mill. Somehow, current organisms have contrived themselves to be such that most mutations are of minor eect. But is it necessarily the case that all complex systems have the property that most mutations are of minor eect? And if not, where does the gradualism of Darwinian selection come from?<n>Importantly, it is easy to create systems that are not readily adaptable by mutation and selection. What follows is not quite a theorem (and was discussed in At Home in the Universe), but it will do. Many of the readers of this book are competent programmers. Consider a typical program, say written in C, Java, or some other language. Perhaps it computes something as simple as the square roots of the first two million integers. Perhaps it simulates an ecosystem. Whatever that program does, imagine trying to evolve it by making random mutations in the code.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
It follows that only some complex systems can be assembled by an evolutionary process. And it turns out that an evolutionary process based on mutation, recombination, and selection, the genetic search mechanisms of current life, does very well on a special kind of fitness landscape, where the high peaks tend to cluster near one another and the sides of the peaks are reasonably smooth, rather like the high Alps.<n>Then, as I first asked in chapter , where do such correlated fitness landscapes come from? More generally, I recall the no-free-lunch theorem of Bill Macready and David Wolpert. Macready and Wolpert wondered whether, averaged over all possible fitness landscapes, some search algorithms, such as mutation and selection, on average outperform all other search algorithms, such as random search on the landscape or hill descending or picking birthdays, taking their square, and jumping that distance in a randomly chosen direction.<n>The no-free-lunch theorem proves that, averaged over all landscapes, no search algorithm outperforms any other. Well, my goodness! On average, random search and hill descending do just as well as hill climbing in finding peaks of high fitness. And here we organisms are, stuck using mutation, recombination, and selection. Yet organisms and ecosystems seem to be pretty complex. Once again, where did the “good” landscapes come from, the ones that Darwinian gradualism works so well in searching?<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt

Naturally, ways of making a living have evolved as organisms have evolved. So rather easily one gets to the conclusion that the winning games are the games that winners play.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
And, as noted in chapter , those ways of making a living that set problems that are well searched out by the search mechanisms of organisms  mutation, recombination, and selection  will be well searched out. Many sibling species will arise and lineages will branch. There will be many species making livings and many cases of livings being made that are well searched out by the search mechanisms of organisms.<n>In short, there must be a self-consistent coconstruction of a biosphere in which organisms, ways of making a living, and search mechanisms jointly and self-consistently come into existence. Organisms are not solving arbitrary problems. We are solving the kinds of problems we can solve given our solution procedures. How could it be otherwise?<n>So, somehow  and we will have to seek plausible mechanisms  organisms are tuning the statistical structure of the fitness landscapes they are searching in evolution. But the problem is very much more complex than merely searching a fixed fitness landscape. Fitness landscapes are not fixed. If the abiotic environment changes, the fitness landscape of organisms changes, buckles, and deforms.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
Economics has its roots in agency and the emergence of advantages of trade among autonomous agents. The advantages of trade predate the human economy by essentially the entire history of life on this planet. Advantages of trade are found in the metabolic exchange of legume root nodule and fungi, sugar for fixed nitrogen carried in amino acids. Advantages of trade were found among the mixed microbial and algal communities along the littoral of the earth’s oceans four billion years ago. The trading of the econosphere is an outgrowth of the trading of the biosphere.<n>Economics has considered itself the science of allocation of scarce resources. In doing so, it shortchanges its proper domain. Indeed, if we stand back and squint, it is easy to see the most awesome feature of an economy and its roots in autonomous agents: The most awesome feature of the econosphere, as of the biosphere  both built by communities of autonomous agents in their urgent plunging, lunging, sliding, gliding, hiding, trading, and providing  has been a blossoming diversity of molecular and organismic species and of novel ways of making a living that has persistently burgeoned into the adjacent possible. From tens of organic molecular species to tens of trillions; from one or a few species of autonomous agents to a standing diversity of some hundred million species and a total diversity some hundred to thousandfold larger of those creatures come and gone.<n>Homo erectus had fire and early tools. Homo habilis traded stone axe parts . million years ago. The diversity of Cro-Magnon goods and services in the south of France some , years ago may have numbered in the several hundreds to a few thousands. Today, surf the web and count the diversity of goods and services, the ways of making a living; it is in the millions.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
Arrow and Debreu made brilliant steps. First, they consider a space of all possible dated and contingent goods. One of their examples of a “dated contingent good” is “ ton of wheat delivered in Chicago on May , , under the condition that the average rainfall in Nebraska for the six preceding months has been percent less than normal for the past fifty years and that the Boston Red Sox won the World Series the previous year.”<n>In the Arrow-Debreu theory, we are to imagine an auctioneer, who at a defined beginning of time, say, this morning, holds an auction covering all possible dated contingent goods. All suppliers and customers gather at this imaginary auction, bidding ensues for all possible dated contingent goods, with values calculated under dierent hypotheses about the probabilities that the dierent dated contingencies will come about. At the end of an imaginary hour of frantic bargaining, the auction closes. All participants now have contracts to buy or sell all possible dated contingent goods, each at a fixed price. Everybody hustles home to watch Good Morning America. And, wondrously, however the future unfolds, whether there’s rain, sun, or snow in Nebraska, the dated contingent contracts that are appropriate come due, the contracts are fulfilled at the preestablished price for each contract, and all markets clear.<n>It is mind-boggling that Arrow and Debreu proved these results. The core means of the solution depends upon what mathematicians call “fixed-point theorems.” A beginning case is your hair, particularly for males, where short hair makes the fixed point easy to see. When you comb your hair in a normal fashion, there is a point roughly on top of your head, slightly to the back, where a roughly circular swirl of hair occurs (ignoring baldness) around a fixed point where typically a bit of scalp shows through.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
We need a theory of the persistent coming into existence of new goods and services and extinction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species. In the previous chapter, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and genera.<n>But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the horse, as a mode of transport, extinct. With the horse went the barn, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the Pony Express. With the car came paved roads, an oil and gas industry, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. More, if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of firms? Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. Most firms die young, some last a long time. We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions.<n>The parallels are at least tantalizing, and probably more than that. While the mechanisms of heritable variation dier and the selection criteria dier, organisms in the biosphere and firms and individuals in the econosphere are busy trying to make a living and explore new ways of making a living. In both cases, the puzzling conditions for the evolutionary cocreation and coassembly of increasing diversity are present. The biosphere and econosphere are persistently transforming, persistently inventing, persistently dying, persistently getting on with it, and, on average, persistently diversifying. And into a framework of such a diversifying set of goods and services we must graft the central insights of general competitive equilibrium as the approximate short-timescale mechanism that achieves a rough-and-ready approximate clearing of markets at each stage of the evolution of the economy.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
Now create a large, square petri plate with rows and columns drawn on the plastic below to guide your experimental hands. Arrange the rows, numbered to to correspond to blue bacteria secreting to molecules a second. Arrange the columns, numbered to to correspond to the red bacteria secreting to molecules a second. Into each of the x cells on your square petri plate, place exactly one red and one blue bacterium with the corresponding secretion rates. Thus, in the upper left, bacteria that are low blue and low red secretors are coplated onto each square. On the lower left, high blue and low red secretors are coplated. On the upper right, low blue and high red secretors are coplated. And in the lower right corner, high red and high blue bacteria are coplated.<n>Go for lunch, and dinner, and come back the next day. In general, among the , coplated pairs of bacteria, while all , colonies will have grown, a single pair will have grown to the largest mixed red-blue bacterial colony. Say the largest mixed red-blue colony corresponds to red secreting molecules per second, blue secreting molecules per second.<n>This gedankenexperiment is important, for the exchange ratio of red and blue molecules is the analogue of price, the ratio of trading of oranges for apples. And there exists a ratio, red molecules to blue molecules per second, that maximizes the growth of the mixed red-blue bacterial colony. Since the fastest growing mixed red-blue colony will exponentially outgrow all others and dominate our gedankenexperiment petri plate, this red-blue pair establishes “price” in the system at red to blue molecules. Further, in the fastest growing red-blue colony, where red secretes molecules and blue secretes molecules per second, both the red and blue bacteria in that mixed colony are replicating at the identical optimum rate. As discussed in chapter , using a rough mapping of biology to economics, that rate of replication of a bacterium corresponds to economic utility and the increased the rate of replication corresponds to increased economic utility. The red and blue bacteria not only establish price, but they also share equally the advantages of trade present along the Pareto-ecient contract curve in the Edgeworth box discussed in chapter .<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt

Indeed, critters have been hacking out rough price equilibria even as exaptations and new ways of living have come into existence and old ways have perished. Presumably, these rough biological price equilibria are reached because in the short and intermediate term they optimize the fitness of both of the mutualists. And the markets clear, in the sense that all the red molecules are exchanged for blue molecules per second. But it’s a self-organized critical world out there, with small and large avalanches of speciation and extinction events in the biosphere and econosphere, and equilibrium price or no, most species and technologies, job holders and jobs, are no longer among us to mumble about advantages of trade.<n>I confess I am happier with this image of prices established in local, rough-and-ready ways at many points in an ecosystem or economy than with the beautiful fixed-point theorems of general competitive equilibrium. Bacteria and horseshoe crabs keep establishing rough price equilibria in their mutualisms without a prespecified space of ways of making a living. If they can do it, so can we mere humans. Getting on with it in the absence of predefined configuration spaces has been the persistent provenance of autonomous agents since we stumbled into existence.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
Because the total utility to the consumer is a simple sum of the discounted utilities of all the possible goods in the economy, finding the optimal plan at any period is just a linear programming problem, and the results are a fixed ratio of construction activities of all the objects produced at that period. The fixed ratio of the activities is the mirror of price, relative to one good, taken as the arbitrary “currency,” or “numeraire.”<n>Over time, the model economy ticks forward. At each period, in general, only some of the possible goods and services are constructed. The others do not make the consumer happy enough. Over time, new goods and services come into existence, and old ones go out of existence in small and large avalanches of speciation and extinction events.<n>Thus, a grammar model, or a physical instantiation of a grammar model such as Lego World, is a toy world with a technology graph of objects and transformations. With the addition of utilities to the dierent objects for one consumer or a set of consumers and a social planner  or more generally, with a set of utilities for the objects that may dier among consumers and with dierent costs and scaling of costs with sizes of production runs of dierent Lego objects  a market economy can be constructed. With defined start-up costs, costs of borrowing money, and bankruptcy rules, a model economy with an evolving set of goods and services can be created and studied.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
If this view is correct, then diversity of goods and services is a major driver of economic growth. Indeed, I believe that the role of diversity of goods and services is the major unrecognized factor driving economic growth. Jane Jacobs had made the same point in her thoughtful books about the relation between economic growth and economic diversity of cities and their hinterlands. Economist Jose Scheinkman, now chairman of economics at the University of Chicago, and his colleagues studied a number of cities, normalized for total capitalization, and found that economic growth correlated with economic diversity in the city. In a similar spirit, microfinancing of a linked diversity of cottage businesses in the third world and the first world seems to be achieving local economic growth where more massive eorts at education and infrastructure, Aswan dams and power grids, seem to fail.<n>Indeed, in the same way in an ecosystem, organisms create niches for other organisms. I suspect, therefore, that over the past . billion years, the growth of diversity of species is autocatalytic, for the number of possible niches increases more rapidly than the number of species filling niches. And in the linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes, the universe as a whole advances autocatalytically into its adjacent possible, driven by the very increase of diversity by which novel displacements from equilibrium come into existence, are detected, are coupled to, and come to drive the endergonic creation of novel kinds of molecules and other entities. Economic growth is part and parcel of the creativity of the universe as a whole.<n>Think of the Wright brothers’ airplane. It was a recombination between an airfoil, a light gasoline engine, bicycle wheels, and a propeller. The more objects an economy has, the more novel objects can be constructed. When we were working with rough stone in the Lower Paleolithic, we pretty much mastered everything that could be done until pressure flaking came along. Most forms of simple stone tools that could be made were made. Today, the adjacent possible of goods and services is so vast that the economy, stumbling and lunging into the future adjacent possible, will only construct an ever smaller subset of the technologically possible.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
It all hangs on object-oriented programming.<n>A case in point is the recent advent of Java, an object-based language, which, as of February had a library of some eighty thousand Java objects. Goodness knows how fast this library of objects is growing. Among the Java objects are “carburetor” objects, “engine block” objects, and “piston” objects, and objects come with “functional” descriptors, such as “is a,” “has a,” “does a,” “needs a,” “uses a.”<n>Both implicitly and, with modest work, explicitly, the “piston” object can discover that it fits into the cylinder hole in the “engine block” object to create a completed piston in a cylinder. The “carburetor” object can discover that it is to be located on top of the “engine block” object, connected to certain “gas line” objects in certain ways.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
And still more. What are the statistics of the transformation of an economic web over time as new goods and services arise in the niches aorded by existing goods and services, and drive old goods and services extinct? No one makes Roman siege engines these days. Cruise missiles do the job better.<n>I believe such object-based economic web tools will come into existence in the near future. Indeed, Bios Group is involved in inventing and making them. And I believe that such tools will be very powerful means of coordinating activities within supply chains and within the larger economy when linked by automated markets.<n>But I do not believe any such algorithmic tool can be complete. Consider the case of the engineers discovering that the engine block is so rigid that the block itself can serve as the chassis for the tractor they are trying to invent. That exaptation seems a genuine discovery. Now imagine that we had had Java object models of all the parts that were to go into the tractor: engine block objects, carburetor objects, piston objects. If, among the properties of the engine block  the proud “is a,” “has a,” “does a,” features  we had not listed ahead of time the very rigidity of the engine block or if that rigidity was not deducible from the other listed properties, then my vaunted economic web model with its algorithmically accessible adjacent possible could not have ever come up with the suggestion: Use the engine block, due to its rigidity, as the chassis.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt

The “molecular clock hypothesis” seems to fit these facts. If one compares hemoglobins from humans, chimps, horses, whales, and so on, in general, the longer ago we diverged from one another in the evolutionary record, the more amino acid mutations distinguish the hemoglobins of the two species involved. Our hemoglobin is very similar to chimp hemoglobin and quite dierent from the whale. So good is this correlation that, within given protein families, it is argued that mutations accumulate with timelike clockwork, hence the molecular clock hypothesis, in which a number of amino acid dierences can be taken as a surrogate for time from the most common ancestor. Dierent protein family clocks seem to run at dierent rates.<n>There is evidence that the clock does not run quite smoothly. John Gillespie, a population biologist now at the University of California at Davis, showed some years ago that amino acid substitutions seemed to come in short bursts that accumulate over long periods of time to a rough molecular clock that “stutters.” Gillespie argued that fitness landscapes were episodically shifting and the bursts of amino acid substitutions were adaptive runs toward nearby newly formed peaks. I agree and suggest that the near accuracy of the molecular clock data over hundreds of millions of years and virtually all species strongly suggests that the biosphere has coconstructed itself such that species, even as they speciate and go extinct, are, as lineages, in the persistently survivable regime.<n>We as organisms have, in fact, constructed our ways of making a living such that those problem spaces are typically, but not always, solvable as coevolution proceeds. And, on average, the same thing holds for the econosphere. As old ways of making a living go extinct, new ones persistently enter. We too, it appears, have coconstructed our econosphere such that our ways of making a living, and discovering new ways of making a living, are manageable, probably in a self-organized critical manner, with small and large speciation and extinction events.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
The experience of food is sensual. It is also first-hand. That is, while it’s fun to read recipes and look at photographs of table settings in Gourmet magazine, no one I know considers this a substitute for eating. The experience of buildings is sensual, too. Yet, many of us get our first glimpses of buildings—particularly celebrated buildings—as images in books, magazines, newspapers, public lectures, and exhibitions. One of the most famous buildings of the Modern movement, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona Pavilion, was known almost entirely through photographs since it was built for an exhibition that lasted only seven months. Before photography, the Paimio Tubercolosis Sanatorium, located in a remote part of Finland, would have remained obscure; as it was, its stunning images brought the young Alvar Aalto worldwide recognition. The Sydney Opera House is another world-famous building that, at least outside Australia, relatively few people have seen first-hand. Yet photography tells us very little about how a building fulfills its function, or about how it is built. For example, the handrails in the often-photographed stairway of the Paimio sanatorium look like standard International Style metal pipes. In fact they are wood—much more pleasant to the touch—painted to look like metal. Well-known photographs of the Barcelona Pavilion show eight free-standing columns supporting a flat slab, and free-standing marble screens that carry no loads, a prototypical International Style structure. In reality, there are columns concealed within the screens, which are not slabs of marble but thin marble sheets attached to a masonry back-up wall. In other words, this 1929 building is an example of traditional layered construction, not of modernistic structural purism.1<n>In photographs, buildings are forever young. The ravages of time, weather, and use are banished. It is a shock to come across a revered architectural icon and to find the concrete stained, the painted window frames chipped, the tiles cracked. Of course, all buildings age, but some age more gracefully than others. A 450-year-old Palladio villa retains its beauty, despite peeling plaster and mossy stonework (perhaps it even looks more enchanting). Most modern buildings, on the other hand, lose their potency if they are not gleaming and machinelike.<n>Obviously, photography highlights the visual qualities of buildings and ignores commodity and firmness. Yet photography cannot completely communicate delight. A visitor to the Seagram Building in New York, for example, is surprised to discover the subtle relationship between Mies’ bronze tower and the Italian Renaissance façade of McKim, Mead & White’s Racquet and Tennis Club on the other side of Park Avenue. Equally deceptive are photographs of Frank Lloyd Wright’s work in Oak Park, since they give no hint of the comfortable suburban surroundings of his so-called prairie houses. As I student, I studied the buildings of Le Corbusier in black and white photographs, which did not prepare me for the shock of experiencing his often wildly polychrome interiors. Nor can photography communicate movement, which is such an integral part of the architectural experience (film is better at this, but not much). Nothing conveys the actual experience of a building like the real thing. To paraphrase Robert Hughes, a photograph of architecture is to architecture as telephone sex is to sex.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch1.txt
A row of no-nonsense 1970s office blocks lines Sixth Avenue on the west side of the park. The largest is the New York Telephone Company Building, whose banal façade of gray-tinted glass and vertical strips of marble fills the block between 41st and 42nd Street. The north side of the park is dominated by the fifty-story W. R. Grace Building, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1972. The swooping travertine façade appears to have been inspired by the buildings of Brasília. This bit of tropical flash is flanked by an undistinguished mirrored glass tower, and a generic brick-and-Colonial-trim box. Built 50 years apart, these commercial office blocks share a balefully functionalist approach to architecture. They are strictly off-the-rack buildings that only a developer could love.<n>Bryant Park also offers distant views of two of Manhattan’s most distinctive skyscrapers: the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. The Chrysler Building started life as a speculative office building. In 1927, the architect William Van Alen, influenced by the recent Parisian exhibition of the arts décoratifs, designed a skyscraper in a style that has come to be known as Art Deco. When the plans were finished, but before construction had begun, the design and the building site were bought by the automobile magnate Walter P. Chrysler. Chrysler wanted the building to serve as a billboard for his company. Van Alen obligingly grafted on eagle-head gargoyles (based on hood ornaments), winged radiator caps, a frieze of steel hubcaps, and black brick accents that suggest running boards. The tower’s most distinctive feature was its stainless-steel cap, which held the Cloud Club, a private dining room for Chrysler executives. Today, the flamboyant Chrysler Building is considered a brilliant emblem of the Jazz Age, but it was not an instant success. When it was built it was roundly criticized as frivolous and flashy. “A stunt design,” sniffed The New Yorker. The New York Times likewise derided the blatant commercialism of the architecture.<n>The Chrysler Building had the distinction of being the world’s tallest building—for a few months, until it was surpassed by the Empire State Building. Although designed at the same time as the Chrysler, the Empire State is quite different in appearance. Its exterior is the architectural equivalent of a gray flannel suit. There is no decoration. The plain limestone walls lack even traditional cornices; chrome-nickel steel mullions extend uninterrupted from the 6th to the 85th floor, accentuating the building’s height. “Ornament is crime” Adolf Loos had proclaimed years before, but the stripped-down appearance of the Empire State Building owed more to an accelerated building schedule—construction took less than eighteen months—than to architectural ideology. In fact, the architects of the skyscraper considered themselves traditionalists. Richmond H. Shreve worked for Carrère & Hastings on the New York Public Library, where he met William Lamb, a recent Ecole graduate. After Carrère’s unfortunate death in an auto accident and Hastings’ retirement, Shreve and Lamb took over the firm (for several years it was called Carrère & Hastings, Shreve & Lamb) and were eventually joined by Arthur Loomis Harmon, who had worked for McKim, Mead & White on the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Despite—or rather because of—their solid Classical roots, Shreve, Lamb and Harmon designed a beautifully proportioned building that became the most famous skyscraper in the world.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch2.txt
The medieval inventors of the Gothic style were likewise influenced by fashion. In the twelfth century, European cathedral builders abandoned the tried-and-true round arch in favor of the pointed arch. This change cannot be explained by functional or structural requirements, since the pointed arch provides only marginal structural advantages; and round-arch technology is perfectly capable of building tall naves, as Durham Cathedral and other magnificent Romanesque churches demonstrate. Cathedral builders obviously found something delightful in the pointed arch, which they used not only as a structural form, but in window tracery, in wood paneling, and even in choir-stall furniture and liturgical accessories. “[Gothic] was seized upon as essential not because it was materially essential, but because the pointed arch struck that note of fantasy which was what the mind of the age desired,” explains John Summerson. “It willfully destroyed the discipline of the round arch, which had become an incubus and a bore.”5 A note of fantasy? A bore? At this point, the eminent architectural historian sounds like a Harper’s Bazaar fashion critic.<n>Architectural reputations, as well as architecture, come under fashion’s sway. Hood, Ely Jacques Kahn, and Ralph Walker (the architect of the Irving Trust Building on Wall Street), all small men, were dubbed the “Three Little Napoleons of Architecture” by The New Yorker. Riding high in the 1920s, their careers were cut short by the Depression—Hood’s more so, since he died in 1934, only 53 years old. Rockefeller Center continued to be admired by the public, but because of his freewheeling approach to design, Hood was marginalized by modernist architectural historians. He was never forgiven for winning the Chicago Tribune competition and beating not only Saarinen, but such European avant-gardists as Adolf Loos, Bruno Taut, and even Walter Gropius, the founder of the Bauhaus and the guiding light of the International Style. Yet if I compare Hood’s RCA Building with Gropius’s Pan Am (today MetLife) Building, there is little doubt who was the more creative designer.<n>Looking at that monolith, bestriding Park Avenue without charm or grace, it is easy to forget that Gropius was once considered one of the great architects of the twentieth century. Architectural memory can be fickle. Thomas Ustick Walter is not a household name, but it should be—he was the architect of the U.S. Capitol dome, probably one of the most powerful symbols of American democracy. The Lincoln Memorial, designed by Henry Bacon, is another famous architectural icon. Bacon died in 1924, only two years after the memorial was dedicated, so he did not see the Classicism that he had learned at McKim’s knee slip out of fashion. At least Walter and Bacon were feted during their lifetimes. Edward Durrell Stone, an International Style wunderkind, developed an unfashionable interest in decoration at a time when architectural austerity was in vogue. And although he received large commissions (including the Kennedy Center for the Arts), he finished his career ignored if not actually ridiculed. In the mid-1960s, Paul Rudolph was probably the most promising young architect in the country. His robustly monumental Art and Architecture Building at Yale, where he was also chairman, reinvigorated postwar American architecture. A decade later, heroic monumentalism was out and Postmodernism was in. Although Rudolph continued to receive commissions in Asia, he was slighted in his own country. His contemporaries Gordon Bunshaft and Kevin Roche were awarded the Pritzker Prize, but Rudolph was passed over. By the time he died in 1997, he was virtually forgotten.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch2.txt
The fate of Rudolph and Furness is a reminder that although architecture is susceptible to fashion, architects are not fashion designers. “I do not design a new architecture every Monday morning,” Mies van der Rohe is reputed to have said. This is often taken as a reflection of his serious commitment to his art. It was that, but it was something else, too. He might as well have said, “I cannot design a new architecture every Monday morning.” The Seagram Building is a masterpiece, not because Mies had a sudden inspiration, but because he had spent decades learning how to bring commodity, firmness, and delight into his particular version of balance; how to attach the travertine to the wall to create a particular effect; which metal fabricator could make a certain kind of handrail; and exactly how deep to make a window mullion to cast the right size of shadow. Buildings are extremely complicated artifacts, and the time necessary to cultivate and refine a particular manner of building cannot be underestimated. This is especially true when the manner of building is personal or unusual, as it was in the case of both Furness and Rudolph. They were not simply being stubborn or high-minded when they refused to adapt to changing fashions, they were being realistic.<n>Morris Lapidus is an architect who has lived long enough to see architectural fashions come full circle. In the 1950s, Lapidus designed many of the largest hotels in the Miami area: the Fontainebleau, the Americana, the Eden Roc. His flamboyant, eclectic designs were ridiculed by the architectural establishment, although they were popular with the public. Today, in a period of so-called entertainment architecture, when the world’s most celebrated architects design theme parks and casinos, Lapidus seems less like a maverick than a pioneer. “The father of us all,” Philip Johnson called him, with only slight exaggeration.<n>•••<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Rybczynski_ch2.txt

We believe such statements do not reflect an adequate appreciation of the FAA's responsibility for the safety and security of civil aviation.<n>The airlines bore responsibility, too. They were facing an escalating number of conflicting and, for the most part, erroneous reports about other flights, as well as a continuing lack of vital information from the FAA about the hijacked flights. We found no evidence, however, that American Airlines sent any cockpit warnings to its aircraft on 9/11. United's first decisive action to notify its airborne aircraft to take defensive action did not come until 9:19, when a United flight dispatcher, Ed Ballinger, took the initiative to begin transmitting warnings to his 16 transcontinental flights: "Beware any cockpit intrusion- Two a/c [aircraft] hit World Trade Center." One of the flights that received the warning was United 93. Because Ballinger was still responsible for his other flights as well as Flight 175, his warning message was not transmitted to Flight 93 until 9:23.<n>By all accounts, the first 46 minutes of Flight 93's cross-country trip proceeded routinely. Radio communications from the plane were normal. Heading, speed, and altitude ran according to plan. At 9:24, Ballinger's warning to United 93 was received in the cockpit. Within two minutes, at 9:26, the pilot, Jason Dahl, responded with a note of puzzlement: "Ed, confirm latest mssg plz-Jason."<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
After consulting with NEADS command, the crew commander issued the order at 9:23:"Okay . . . scramble Langley. Head them towards the Washington area. . . . [I]f they're there then we'll run on them. . . . These guys are smart." That order was processed and transmitted to Langley Air Force Base at 9:24. Radar data show the Langley fighters airborne at 9:30. NEADS decided to keep the Otis fighters over New York. The heading of the Langley fighters was adjusted to send them to the Baltimore area. The mission crew commander explained to us that the purpose was to position the Langley fighters between the reported southbound American 11 and the nation's capital.<n>At the suggestion of the Boston Center's military liaison, NEADS contacted the FAA's Washington Center to ask about American 11. In the course of the conversation, a Washington Center manager informed NEADS:"We're looking- we also lost American 77." The time was 9:34. This was the first notice to the military that American 77 was missing, and it had come by chance. If NEADS had not placed that call, the NEADS air defenders would have received no information whatsoever that the flight was even missing, although the FAA had been searching for it. No one at FAA headquarters ever asked for military assistance with American 77.<n>At 9:36, the FAA's Boston Center called NEADS and relayed the discovery about an unidentified aircraft closing in on Washington:"Latest report. Aircraft VFR [visual flight rules] six miles southeast of the White House. . . . Six, southwest. Six, southwest of the White House, deviating away." This startling news prompted the mission crew commander at NEADS to take immediate control of the airspace to clear a flight path for the Langley fighters:"Okay, we're going to turn it . . . crank it up. . . . Run them to the White House." He then discovered, to his surprise, that the Langley fighters were not headed north toward the Baltimore area as instructed, but east over the ocean." I don't care how many windows you break," he said." Damn it. . . . Okay. Push them back."<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt

If you are traveling by car, continue to the Barragem (dam) do Arade. The water collected in this reservoir surrounded by pine hills provides irrigation for the area’s profitable orchards. It’s a refreshing spot, perfect for a picnic as well as sailing and windsurfing.<n>Lagoa, a sizeable town east of Portimão, is the province’s wine capital. The acidic vinhos da casa served in most restaurants on the Algarve come from here. Lagoa wine, both red and white, is more powerful than ordinary wine, and the extra degree or two of alcoholic content can creep up on you. The local tourist office can arrange tours of wineries and tastings (Adega de Cooperativa de Lagoa; Tel. 282/342 181; 24 hours in advance). New golf courses are being built in the area, but there’s little else to detain visitors.<n>From Lagoa, turn south about 5 km (3 miles) to the charming resort of Carvoeiro, an archetypal small Barlavento resort. The beach is about the size of a tablecloth compared with some of the expanses to the east. A single road runs down through a pretty valley until it comes to a small crescent of sand shared by families of sunbathers and fishing boats. Above, rows of bright white houses perch on red sandstone cliffs while cafés and restaurants fill the spaces in between. The original village of Carvoeiro is now fairly commercialized, but to many people it remains one of the coast’s most attractive resorts.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
The architectural highlight of the village is the beautiful 16th-century Igreja Matriz, entered through a classic Manueline portal. The church keeper will enthusiastically point out the many elaborate chapels and the rare 16th-century Sevillana azulejos. The rest of Alte is the Algarve of postcards — white-washed houses along narrow streets, colorful windows, filigreed chimney pots, and red-tiled roofs. And while their character may at first seem uniform, you won’t see two houses the same.<n>Follow the stream upriver and you come to the popular Pequena Fonte (Little Fountain) springs, where a restaurant and occasional folk dancing draw visitors. The setting is delightful and a perfect spot for a picnic.<n>If you continue east on N-124, you’ll pass rolling hills and come to the pretty village of Salir, which is built on the edge of a steeply rising ridge and has two fine lookout points. The first is in the village itself, alongside the 16th-century parish church and water tower (don’t miss the delightful gardens next door). The other, with the best views, is the adjacent peak, which once held a Moorish stronghold (follow signs to the Castelo). All that remains of the castle are the bases of four huge turrets (12th–13th century) and some excavations. The old castle grounds are home to a tiny hamlet, complete with its own church. The panoramic views across to the main part of Salir and the surrounding countryside are spectacular, and there is even a tiny miradouro (belvedere) café here.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt

Back toward Almancil is one of the Algarve’s top attractions, but if you’re not looking closely, it’s easy to miss. About 16 km (10 miles) west of Faro, a simple white church stands out on a small hill overlooking the thundering highway. A sign simply says “S. Lourenço” — indicating the turn-off to São Lourenço do Matto (Church of St. Lawrence of the Woods). Inside is one of the most extraordinary displays of azulejo design you’ll ever see. Every square inch of the Baroque, 15th-century church — its walls, vaulted ceiling, and cupola — is covered with hand-painted, blue-and-white ceramic tiles. Most date from the early 18th century and depict biblical scenes detailing the life of St. Lawrence, born across the border in Huesca, Spain. The only element of the church not blue-and-white is the carved, gilded altar. The ensemble is a stunning sight, not to be missed.<n>Loulé, north of Almancil, is a regional produce center with a large Saturday market, known for its leather, lace, and copper goods. Loulé is a prosperous town with an ambitious, modern boulevard complete with outdoor cafés that are jam-packed on market day. Coach parties come from far and wide to shop at the colorful, bustling market.<n>There are actually two markets. Fresh produce, including fish, is sold in a mock-Moorish hall, while a “gypsy market” is held towards the opposite end of the boulevard. Just below the permanent market halls, on the main Praça da República, you’ll find a well-preserved section of the medieval castle walls (which were much damaged by the 1755 earthquake). The ramparts afford excellent views from the town, and set into the castle remains is a modest local museum. Also worth visiting are the Igreja Matriz (São Clemente), a 13th-century Gothic church with 18th-century azulejo tiles; the Convento da Graça, with a terrific Manueline portal; and Ermida de Nossa Senhora da Conceição, a small church prized for its Baroque altar and ceramic tiles.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
The Sotavento Coast<n>Heading east from the provincial capital of Faro, the first settlement of any size you will come to is the colorful fishing town of Olhão. A working port, it has made few concessions to tourism and is full of character.<n>Olhão has often been described as the “little white Cubist town of the Algarve,” its architecture likened to that of North African towns. That may have been the case some years ago, but modern development has strongly interfered with its once distinctive appearance. You can judge for yourself by ascending the bell tower of the parish church (which also goes by the name of Nossa Senhora do Rosário), which you will find by winding your way through the narrow streets back to the Praça da Restauração (you may have to ask for access to the tower in the sacristy). Founded by King Dom Pedro II in 1698, the church has an impressive, scroll-decorated Baroque façade, brilliant white dome, stone belltower, and a chapel at the rear, Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos (Our Lady of the Afflicted), where women often pray when their fishermen husbands are away at sea.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
East Toward Spain<n>After the salty flavor of Olhão and the rural serenity of Moncarapacho, the aristocratic bearings of Tavira, one of the true gems of the Algarve, may come as something of a surprise. One of the region’s most historic cities, its Moorish, Reconquista, and Renaissance roots are clearly visible.<n>In the 1500s, Tavira had the largest population on the Algarve. This tuna-fishing port and self-assured town of historic churches, imposing classical-style mansions, and riverfront gardens probably dates back as far as the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians. In fact, its seven-arched stone bridge of Roman origin is still in use.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
At ground level, seedy or amusing ( depending on your point of view) shops sell sex wares, attracting customers from all walks of life; but don’t get too distracted, else you’ll miss the rows of dainty gables, quirky wall plaques, and window boxes brimming with flowers, which give the whole area a cheery feel. Don’t be surprised to find offices, shops, and restaurants living side by side with the brothels here — it’s all part of Amsterdam life.<n>At night the streets come alive with bars, clubs, and adult shows. It is one of liveliest parts of the city after dark. Just make sure that you stay on the busier and well-lit thoroughfares as you make your way back to your hotel.<n>You will find several historical gems as you wander Walletjes. One of the narrow houses on Oudezijds Voorburgwal — number 40 — has a wonderful secret to share. Museum Amstrelkring was a merchant’s house bought by Catholic Jan Hartman in 1661. Following the Alteration in 1578 Catholics were not permitted to practice their religion, and Hartman — along with a number of other wealthy Catholics of the time — had a secret chapel built, where his family and friends could worship. Although they were common at the time, this is now the only secret chapel left in the city, and because of its location in the house is called “Our Lord in the Attic” or Ons’ Lieve Heer op Solder. Over its years of use as a church, three surrounding houses were added to create extra space, and several of the other rooms are furnished in authentic 18th-century style. It is a fascinating glimpse of a very difficult time in Amsterdam’s history, but it’s not just a museum piece — the church is still used for weddings.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
Pride of place must go to the Rijksmuseum (The National Art Gallery) with arguably the greatest collection of Dutch art in the world. The collection is housed in a magnificent Victorian Gothic building, especially designed for it by P. J. H. Cuypers, which was opened in 1885. The museum can be a confusing maze of connecting rooms — additions were completed in 1898 and 1919 — so it pays to sit down for a few minutes to study the very comprehensive map, which accompanies your ticket. A multimedia interactive study area also allows you to review the vast collection on a screen, pinpoint works which you want to see, and print out further details of each piece. The center, called ARIA (Amsterdam Rijksmuseum InterActief), is located in room 225, behind the Night Watch room. You can also take advantage of an audio CD tour to give you background detail as you explore.<n>The collection is varied but most visitors come to see the works of the Dutch masters. Dutch painting of the 15th to 17th centuries are to be found in rooms 201 to 236 on the second floor. Among the collection are 20 works by Rembrandt, including The Nightwatch, properly entitled The Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq and Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch. The work, which was commissioned by the company for its barracks, is remarkable for its lack of formality and very different from the accepted style of the day.<n>Johannes Vermeer (1632–1675) is also well-represented, and his effective use of light can be clearly seen in The Kitchen Maid, painted in 1660, which is one of the gallery’s best-loved pieces. There are paintings by Frans Hals, the founding artist of The Dutch School, along with a collection of Dutch artists influenced or schooled by the masters. Rembrandt was a prolific teacher and his pupils produced work so similar to his that in later years many were initially mistaken for the great artist’s work.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
A Brief History<n>In ancient Greek mythology Athens is named following a contest between Athena, goddess of wisdom, and Poseidon, god of the sea. Both had their eye on the prize real estate, so it was agreed that whoever could come up with the more useful gift for mortals would win. The half-human, half-serpent king of Athens, Cecrops, acted as arbiter.<n>First came Poseidon, who struck the rock of the Acropolis with his mighty trident and brought salt water gushing forth. Then it was Athena’s turn. As she struck the rock an olive tree appeared, which proved more useful and valuable. Thus she acquired the position of the city’s special protector.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-History.txt
For almost 50 years after Platae, peace reigned at home, and the victorious city-state entered its most brilliant era. Athens was instrumental in bringing the disparate Aegean and mainland communities together, creating a “league of nations”, known as the Delian League. The headquarters of the League was originally on the island of Delos but it was moved to Athens itself in 454 b.c. The resources of the treasury of the Delian League were used — among other things — to build the Parthenon and other monuments that still adorn the Acropolis today.<n>The moving power behind this unrivaled time of greatness, which has come to be known as the Golden Age, was Pericles. This liberal-inclined aristocrat was, in effect, the supreme ruler of Athens and its empire for 30 years until his death in 429 b.c.<n>Great works of art, literature, science, and philosophy were produced by what Pericles referred to as the “school of Hellas.” Major names of the time included the dramatists Euripides and Sophocles, the historian Herodotus, the philosopher Socrates, and the brilliant scientists Zeno and Anaxagoras. The first literary salon in history was presided over by Aspasia, Pericles’ mistress, a remarkable woman of intelligence and spirit.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-History.txt
Athenians understand this. They are not daunted or downhearted by their surroundings, they enjoy their city, revelling in the opportunities it gives them. Every district has its own small squares with cafés, where people gather for a drink or meal — and Athenians love to eat out. You’ll be surprised at the wealth of good restaurants offering international cuisine, and how much post-modernist décor influences interior design in the smarter districts. Of course the Greek taverna hasn’t become extinct. Locals as much as visitors enjoy the fresh and delicious cuisine that’s been served in Greece for centuries. Greek theater is thriving at new auditoria such as the Megaron complex, or at the open-air theaters on Lycabettus Hill. The annual Athens Festival has a full program of music, dance, and poetry with a rich historical legacy. Sports are still avidly followed, though today it’s more likely to be football, not a discus throw, that excites the emotions. Powerboat racing out on the waters of the Saronic Gulf also raises the adrenalin of the wealthy.<n>Tradition still plays an important part in daily life here. The family forms the backbone of Greek society and filial ties are strong. Children play safely in the streets with grandma keeping a watchful eye. New babies are proudly shown to the world in the evening volta or stroll, when neighbors come to “bill and coo.” Families gather for a weekend meal, taking over a corner of a taverna to spend a couple of hours in noisy debate (some may say argument) while perhaps having a little food. Eating always takes second place to conversation at a Greek meal. Greek hospitality is warm and genuine — even small examples such as always being welcomed with a smile and shown to your seats at a taverna. Shopkeepers are skilled salesmen, but never pushy or overbearing.<n>The Orthodox Church — for so long the one thing that united the Hellenic Diaspora — still has a strong influence on the population. Everyone from suited businessmen to young soldiers on national service make a regular visit to Athens Cathedral or a small local church to light a candle. People stop in on the way home from work or in their lunch breaks; it’s such a normal part of everyday life here. The Greek language also unifies the congregation with the clergy and Greeks around the world, though its use gives the capital a decidedly exotic air as visitors struggle to make sense of these “foreign” letters. There’s also a sense of patriotism and national pride here even among the young — perhaps brought about by political upheavals in the late 20th century. Since Greek democracy was restored in 1975, after the military dictatorship, it is as though the population relish their country all the more.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-Intro.txt
Athens comes alive after dark with a range of activities to fill your diary. However, you’ll probably need to alter your normal routine to enjoy it as the locals do. Theater performances are followed by a late leisurely dinner, often after 11pm, and if you intend to head out to a nightclub, don’t expect to start until around midnight.<n>Even if you only want to sample the delights of Greek tavernas and perhaps stroll around Plaka, the real atmosphere starts after 9pm when Greek families come out to eat. If you can hold your appetite that long you’ll have a much more authentic experience.<n>Athenscope is a free publication that lists all activities taking place during the time of your stay, but here are the major forms of entertainment that you could enjoy.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhatToDo.txt
Spectator Sports<n>Football (soccer): Football is a national obsession for the Greeks and Athens’ teams (Panathanaikos and AEK Athens) feature prominently in domestic and European competitions. The season runs from September to May. Panathanaikos Football Stadium is located at Kifissia, a northern suburb — this will be the major stadium for the 2004 Olympic Games, which will be held in the city. Ask your hotel if it is possible to get tickets as these are difficult to come by.<n>Horseracing: Athens Race course can be found at the bottom of Syngrou Avenue where racing takes place on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. Plans have been drawn up to redevelop the course as part of the Athens 2004 Olympic program, so make enquiries with your hotel or the EOT before making the journey out to the course.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhatToDo.txt
Statuary: If you want a little piece of ancient Greece then you’ll certainly be able to find it. It will be a reproduction of course — but still you can own your own copy of Zeus, Poseidon, or Athena herself, small enough to grace a table or large enough to decorate a garden. Plaques depicting ancient friezes, or masks to hang on walls are also extremely popular, as are Mycenaean helmets. If classical statuary is too ornate for your taste, you can also find copies of the minimalist Mycenaean statues found at the Goulandris Museum. The National Archaeological Museum also has a wide range of copies of its artifacts. Each comes with a certificate of authentication.<n>Leatherware: Local craftsmen have always worked goat and cow hides and the industry continues today. Footwear, bags, and clothing come in a range of styles, though quality is generally more rustic and bohemian than similar items produced in Italy or France.<n>Carpets and needlepoint: Ottoman craftsmen left behind a legacy in both the use and production of fine carpets — look for hand-knotted ornate patterns in wool or silk which come with a hefty price tag. Hand-produced Greek flotaki rugs were traditionally used in farmhouses across the Greek world and are made from sheep wool. They are sold by weight and are decorated with traditional symbols such as deer, or patterns, such as the Mycenaean geometric designs.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhatToDo.txt

Machine-produced pieces are readily available in the form of tablecloths, napkins, cushions, and handkerchiefs. Or you could try a traditional embroidered hat complete with long silk tassel, now only worn during folkloric spectacles.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhatToDo.txt
The Acropolis Museum in the southeast corner of the plateau was opened in 1934. It was designed and built so as not to spoil the skyline or compete with the temples and it cannot be seen from the streets of the city or from the sacred way as you enter through the Propylaia. Much of the fine statuary and carved friezes still present when Ottoman forces left have been displayed here along with four of the original Caryatid statues from the Erechtheíon. The museum displays pieces of the ornate decorative pediment that adorned the temples, and dedications to Athena herself found in the inner sanctuary. The whole collection is breathtaking and proof if it were needed of the immense wealth and influence of this ancient site. Each room has something of note but look for the pediment of a lion tearing apart a bull, dating from the sixth century b.c. in room 1. Pediment depicting a triple-headed demon, and a kouros (male statue) named The Calf-bearer — a young man carrying a calf to ritual slaughter at the temple — are both displayed in room 2. Kritikos Boy and Blond-haired Boy — two sculptures carved in the “severe” style fashionable around 480 b.c. are displayed in room 6. Panels from the Ionic frieze that decorated the Parthenon are in room 8, and the original Caryatids can be found in room 9.<n>When you have explored the architectural delights of the Acropolis, take time to enjoy the views from its walls. Sections of the stone defences date back to Mycenaean times, though the majority were constructed during the first millennium and were reinforced by the Turks. From the north you can take in the other major archaeological sites and the district of Plaka directly below. From the east the verdant slopes of Mount Lycabettus come into view, with the smart district of Kolonaki on its lower slopes. South leads the eye towards the coast and the islands of the Saronic Gulf.<n>As you leave the site via the smooth stone path through the Propylaia you’ll pass the Monument of Agrippa. Originally erected with a single chariot to commemorate victory in the Panathenaic Games, a second chariot group including Marcus Agrippa was added in 27 b.c. You’ll leave through the Beulé Gate, a remaining part of the Roman defensive system.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
To the west of the Acropolis stands another small range of hills now cut by footpaths and covered in trees offering cooling shade in the heat of summer. This area, reached by crossing Odós Rovertou Gali and walking up behind the Dionysus restaurant, offers splendid views across to the Acropolis (it’s the best place for afternoon overviews), and the Sound and Light Show auditorium is located here for this reason. Several archaeological sites can be seen and the area is much less crowded than the Acropolis itself. You’ll also see the 16th century church, Ayios Dimítrios Loumbardhi, nestling under the woodland canopy.<n>In the northeastern area, you’ll come to the Hill of the Pnyx, meeting place of the Assembly of Athens. Loosely translated, pnyx means “crowded or tightly packed place,” and in ancient times this was a highly populated area. You’ll see the outlines of walls, including the defensive Themistoklean Wall, between the bushes or under the turf as you stroll. The Pnyx meeting place can be found below the summit on the northeastern side of the hill. When democracy was established at the end of the sixth century b.c. the debating chamber moved from the Agora to this structure and it was here that the great statesmen of Greece made their speeches at the rostrum. Seats were provided for the 5,000 citizens of the city needed for a decision-making quorum, who would listen to the arguments of Pericles and Themistocles.<n>On the Hill of the Nymphs north of the Pnyx you’ll see the Neo-Classical lines of the original Athens Observatory, founded in 1842. Perhaps the most popular point for visitors lies in the south where at the highest point — Hill of the Muses or Philopappos Hill — is the Tomb of Philopappos, a high-ranking nobleman in Roman times. Its convex façade has a sculptured frieze depicting Julius Philopappos riding a chariot and performing his duties in the Senate. It is from here that you’ll get the best views of the Acropolis, so don’t forget your camera or video recorder!<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
Taking the Metro (the overland electric railway section) from downtown Athens costs only 250drs and brings you directly to the waterside. Huge quaysides in the Main Harbor cater to hundreds of ferries large and small, and you’ll see fleets of large container ships laying anchor offshore. Walking south along the quaysides brings you to a small shady square with the Cathedral of Agia Triada on its northern flank. Take this street (Dimokratias) to the Town Hall and visit the lively daily market that takes place in the surrounding streets.<n>Take a right down Lampraki to reach the pretty harbor of Zea. This is one of the marinas used for pleasure craft, and where Athenians — rich and not so rich — moor their boats. These range from simple rowing boats of just a few feet in length to hundred-foot ocean-going vessels. A wide promenade  — Akti Moutsopoulou — frames the bay and this is where local people come to stroll in the evenings and on weekends —  you can sit at a portside café and watch the world go by.<n>North from Zea harbor is another pretty harbor, Mikrolimani (Small Harbor) or Tourkolimani, where you’ll find the fishing fleet and some good fish tavernas. Or head south towards the main historical attractions of Piraeus.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
Paintings and art work with scenes of everyday life also make beautiful mementos. The work of a number of artists, including Alton Lowe and Eddie Minnis, is becoming very collectable and prices can be high. On the other end of the scale, street art, including things like driftwood paintings, can be fun and much more affordable.<n>Wood carvings are made from a variety of native trees. Some of the best are made from the lignum vitae, the Bahamian national tree, and from the wild tamarind. The carvings come in a bewildering variety, though animal and fish motifs seem to predominate. Always check a piece thoroughly before you buy as they are vary in quality. Don’t buy wood if it looks green — this usually means the wood has not been allowed to season, and it may split as it dries.<n>Seashells and sponges can be found in every market and souvenir shop in the Bahamas. They make beautiful, natural souvenirs, but some may come from protected species. Do not buy coral or turtle products as this is illegal and only encourages further damage to these delicate and rare forms of sea life.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhatToDo.txt

Many of the shops on Bay Street, at the International Bazaar, and the Port Lucaya Market Place offer beachwear and T-shirts galore. Sarongs, printed dresses, and shirts in light fabrics are sold in almost every craft stall in the straw markets. Light-cotton Androsia clothing, made on Andros, is perfect for the Bahamian climate; you’ll find these items all over the Bahamas.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhatToDo.txt
Sailing. With hundreds of unpopulated islands and dozens of empty beaches surrounded by dozens of shallow channels and sounds the Bahamas are paradise for sailors. Safe harbors with superb facilities, cozy coves for a night alone, and the possibility of making short hops to a different port every night allow sailors to experience all the different atmospheres of the various islands.<n>On many of the islands, renting a boat is as easy as renting a car is in other destinations — especially on the more populated Out Islands. Rentals can vary from small runabouts that will get you around the harbor and the coastal shallows to large sailing yachts and motor launches for inter-island expeditions. Rates vary enormously. To make more of a stay in the Abacos or Exumas, where there are many outlaying cays, you can rent a 18-ft (51⁄2-m) boat with small outboard motor for around $80 per day. Larger vessels come with a crew and/or guide; if you sail your own boat, you can take advantage of the services of a local guide to take you to fishing, snorkeling, or dive sites.<n>The Abacos are most popular spot for sailing, primarily because of the many sheltered harbors and the many islands and cays that you can reach without having to go outside of the reefs and into ocean waters. If you want to get out and see a lot of boats without doing any sailing, head to the Bahamas during the Regattas, when boats crowd the harbors and the little towns are full of yachtsmen. Listen to the stories of heroic deeds in the bars and enjoy the wonderful views of masts filling the skies.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhatToDo.txt
Immediately in front of the cruise port you’ll find a line of horse-drawn surreys waiting to offer you a genteel tour along the historic streets. The horses wait under the cooling shade for their next customers. (In the hot summer months the horses are not allowed to work from 2–4pm.) The horses trot slowly past all the sights in town, but you can also easily stroll around yourself and see everything in a couple of hours — if you’re not seduced by the many shopping opportunities between the docks and the historic old town.<n>The first sight that will attract your attention is the Straw Market on Market Plaza, which backs onto Woodes Rodgers Walk. For many years this has been the showcase for Bahamian handicrafts. Straw goods, including baskets and mats, are favorite souvenirs; each island produces straw goods in its own style and patterns. Bestsellers are hats, dolls, bags, and baskets. There is some exquisite work to be found, but be aware that with a decline in basket-making throughout the Bahamas, an increasing number of articles are imported from the Far East; most of these are at the cheaper end of the scale. The ubiquitous modern souvenir, the T-shirt, is also available, with an almost limitless number of pictures, patterns, and slogans. The ladies who run the stalls are easy-going and seem to have limitless enthusiasm for the next sale. You’ll hear numerous calls of “Hey, honey, come look for something nice here.”<n>The straw market fronts onto Bay Street, one of the leading duty-free shopping capitals of the world. Only a few years ago this street was the domain of the Bay Street Boys, a small group of men who controlled all economic activity in the Bahamas; now Bay Street seduces visitors with huge sparkling gems, hundreds of ounces of gold, and the smell of a thousand designer fragrances. The façades of the pretty 18th-century shops hide modern air-conditioned shopping palaces piled high with luxury goods.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
Paradise Island<n>Across Nassau Harbour north of the town is Paradise Island, known until the 1940s as Hog Island. For many centuries the island simply acted as a protective barrier against bad weather and attack from invaders. Its recent history is fascinating: In the 1930s it was owned by Swedish millionaire Axel Wenner-Gren, an arms manufacturer who was found to be a Nazi sympathizer. He sold the island to Huntingdon Hartford, who changed the name from Hog to Paradise and created a beautiful private retreat, now the Ocean Club Hotel. Later gangster Per Lansky began the process that transformed the island from a private sanctuary with magnificent homes into a playground for tourists. The wonderful beaches, such as Cabbage Beach on the northern coast, were the focus of the development. The first hotels began to appear in the 1960s when gambling was a lure to the rich and famous. As Paradise Island saw owners Donald Trump and Merv Griffin come and go, it went through a continuing series of developments and re-developments.<n>Today Paradise Island may be close to fulfilling the dream of the perfect vacation playground. It has many of the essential ingredients needed: fine white-sand beaches, a protected marina, a golf course, a group of fine hotels, and perhaps the biggest adult playground this side of Las Vegas. The brainchild of the Sol Group, Atlantis Paradise Island is a new concept in resorts — it’s a huge hotel with an amazing theme park and entertainment village all on one site. The resort takes its name, and inspiration, from the lost city of Atlantis, said by some to lie off the coast of Bimini. This theme runs throughout the whole resort. The vast open foyers and public areas of the hotel have high columns of cathedral-like dimensions; the walkways and outside terraces recall Mayan temples, with large stones covering the façade. Waterfalls literally or figuratively cascade to give a feeling of a city just having risen from the ocean. Man-made sheltered lagoons provide for safe swimming, snorkeling, and sunbathing.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
Nearby is Ardastra Gardens, Zoo, and Conservation Centre, a landscaped park famed for its pink flamingos, which are paraded three times a day into a small enclosure to offer visitors a closer look. These birds, once common in certain Bahamian islands, are now disappearing, though the reasons for the decline are disputed. Another endangered species, the Bahamian Parrot, is under threat from loss of habitat. The Gardens is one of only a small number of centers that has developed a breeding program for this vocal and gregarious bird in the hope of replenishing colonies in the wild. There are many more species of Caribbean mammals, reptiles, birds, and fish to find as you explore the 51⁄2 acres of tropical parkland.<n>Head back to the main coast road and you will find two small cays lying immediately offshore. The first is Arawak Cay, home to the local fishing fleet. A number of colorful shacks line the approach road where you can buy conch and fried fish, always fresh and always delicious. Weekends can be busy with local families. Travel through Arawak Cay to reach Silver Cay, where there is a small resort with a pretty beach. Here you will find Crystal Cay, site of a marine park where you can take a close look at the undersea world without getting wet. A man-made coral reef has been created on the sea bottom and you can watch all the marine activity from an underwater observatory. The reef attracts many kinds of aquatic creatures that are free to come and go as they please. The observatory looks decidedly futuristic and can be seen quite clearly from the road as you travel along the coast. Other activities at Crystal Cay include a sea turtle environment, a touch pool where you can stroke a sting ray or pet a conch, and a snorkel trail, if you want to get into the water yourself.<n>A little further west along the coast you will find Cable Beach, the third main center of tourism on New Providence. Several luxury hotels line the shore, only 5 minutes by car from central Nassau. The Nassau Marriott Resort Hotel attracts many visitors with its casino, stage shows, and restaurants. The Cable Beach “strip” is under continual development, and a number of private restaurants have opened recently to provide alternatives for guests staying at the resorts.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
Lucaya is set on a fine sandy beach and the expansive Port Lucaya marina gives the whole resort a very nautical feel. A number of large hotels line the Lucayan Beach, their massive façades softened by the hundreds of masts of the yachts moored on the inlet. As of late 1999, the casinos and many of the hotels were being given a facelift and three of the larger hotels on the waterfront were being reconfigured into a single complex.<n>Port Lucaya Marketplace is the center of all activity for the town. During the day the duty-free shops in this Mediterranean-style shopping village tempt shoppers with jewelry, clothing, and perfume; colorful wooden huts house craft stalls selling straw work and carvings. As the sun sinks people gather at the marketplace after a day on the beach or sailing offshore. The streets come alive as bars and restaurants fill up and bands play live music at the Count Basie Bandstand in a square adjoining the marina.<n>On the south side of the marina, accessible from the main beach road, is the Underwater Explorers Society or UNEXSO. The oldest diving organization in the Bahamas, UNEXSO provides diving experience sessions and training courses. The large square building contains a diving pool and decompression chamber; those with no interest in actually practicing the sport can visit the museum, which charts the development of diving to the modern SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) method developed by Jacques Cousteau in the 1930s. There is also a good restaurant on site, the Brass Helmet. A short boatride from Port Lucaya takes you to Sanctuary Bay and the UNEXSO Dolphin Experience. A family of bottlenose dolphins have set up home here. You can linger by the side of the bay and hope they come to you, get in the water and swim with them, or spend a day as an assistant trainer and help the staff care for these gentle creatures.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt

As you head east out of town you’ll soon leave the trappings of modernity behind and find yourself on a good road through acres of Bahamian forest. The road crosses a number of canals, and just off the south coast is Petersons Cay, a tiny but beautiful coral cay with a beach — a great spot for a day of swimming, snorkeling, sunbathing, and picnicking.<n>After traveling approximately 10 miles on the main road you’ll come to Lucaya National Park (there’s a small parking lot on your left). The 40-acre (16-hectare) park sits on both sides of the main road and protects a range of Bahamian ecosystems. Inland, trails lead to one of the largest surveyed cave systems in the world, much of which lies underwater. Ben’s Cave, also known as Bats Cave for reasons that will be obvious when you enter, is the most accessible and in fact rather small. It links to the larger caves through subterranean tunnels. The pool in the bottom has layers of fresh water lying on top of salt water. Remains of several Lucayan Indians that were found at the cave entrance are now being studied in Nassau. The caves are also home to a rare species of crustacean, spelonectes Lucayensis, which is said to resemble a swimming centipede. Ben’s Cave is closed during June and July to protect the bats during the breeding season.<n>From the right-hand side of the road, well-marked trails lead through the vegetation and out toward the coast, just a few hundred meters away (a line of casuarina trees marks the spot). Wooden walkways lead you farther out over a tidal mangrove swamp to Gold Rock Beach. One of the most beautiful beaches on the island, Gold Rock must really be seen at low tide to appreciate its full glory. At high tide a shallow layer of water, only a couple of inches deep, covers much of the beach, leaving only a narrow arc of sand above the waterline. This whole area can also be explored by bicycle or kayak or by taking an eco-tour. One of the companies that offers both eco- and cultural tours of the area is East End Adventures (Tel. 373-6662; e-mail <safari@batalnet.bs>).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
A few miles south of North Eleuthera Airport the island narrows to a rocky ridge just 80 ft (24 m) wide. Over the millennia, an arched hole had been created here by the pounding of the waves of the Atlantic; known as the Glass Window, this opening made it possible for sailors on the Exuma Sound to see “through the island” to the Atlantic. The natural bridge that had been formed at the top of the arch collapsed years ago during a hurricane and today you pass over the still dramatic gap from north to central Eleuthera on the man-made Glass Window Bridge. The bridge requires continual maintenance because storms, hurricanes, high winds, and heavy seas take a constant toll; in turbulent weather the Atlantic rises in great waves pushing towards the still, calm Caribbean.<n>The first settlement after Glass Window Bridge is Gregory Town, a pretty hillside community of colorful houses overlooking a tiny harbor. This is the capital of pineapple production in the Bahamas. Try the fresh pies from Thompson’s Bakery on the top of a hill east of the harbor. Halfway down the island is Governor’s Harbour, a photogenic town set on the sheltered eastern coastline. It is a major center for sailors, who come here to stock up on all the essentials, obtain spare parts, and have repairs done.<n>Windermere Island, just off the east coast, was once the place to be in the Bahamas, but its smart resort hotel is now closed. Jacques Cousteau had a home here and used it as a base for exploring the seas around the other Bahamian islands.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
The family of Neville Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister who attempted to negotiate with Hitler before World War II, created a sisal farm on the island, but the attempt failed miserably.<n>Andros is famed for its natural attractions: It has the third longest barrier reef in the world, lying just one mile (11⁄2 km) offshore and stretching 140 miles (225 km) down the east coast. This makes it a popular destination with divers who come to explore the tidal shallows, the reef, and the deep reef walls, which plunge 6,000 ft (1,829 m) down into the Tongue of the Ocean, the deep passage between Andros and New Providence. Numerous species of sea life flourish at every level and contribute to the abundant variety of diving environments available for all ability levels. Experienced divers also come to explore the numerous so-called “blue holes” that dot the interior of the island. Created by erosion of the limestone rock, these holes have a layer of fresh water that lies on top and tidal sea water below; sea water forced in through countless underground fissures causes their water levels to rise or fall with the tides. Andros is awash with fresh water, which is put to good use: over 6 million gallons are pumped into tankers each day and shipped across to New Providence, where fresh water is much in demand.<n>The miles of shallow “flats” that meet the mangrove swamps along the west coast are an ideal environment for bonefish, and Andros lays claim to being the Bonefishing Capital of the World. The fishing is extremely challenging, either from boats off the island or by wading in the shallows just offshore. Onshore, Andros is a bird watcher’s paradise — hardwood forests of Bahamian mahogany and mangrove and smaller areas of pine offer a varied habitat to over 120 native and migratory species.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
The island itself also has peculiarities that separate it from other Bahamian Islands. It is the most undulating of the islands; one could even call it hilly, with the highest point of land in the Commonwealth, Mount Alvernia, rising to the heady heights of 216 ft (66m) above sea level.<n>Many visitors come to this island, named after an English sea captain called Catt, for its beautiful quiet beaches. Fernandez Bay, with its arc of fine sand on the protected western side of the island, is said to be the finest in the Bahamas, and the nearby beach at Old Bight is not far behind in terms of beauty. Though you can’t go wrong anywhere on the western coast.<n>Mount Alvernia, in the center of the island, is not far from the airfield at New Bight. This settlement originally served as a hermitage for Father Jerome, an Anglican missionary who had converted to Catholicism and become an influential churchman on the Out Islands, responsible for the erection of a number of Catholic Churches. Father Jerome built a small Hermitage on the heights of Mount Alvernia that you’ll see as you reach the summit (a 15-minute walk from a rudimentary car park); the missionary was buried in a small hilltop cave here upon his death in 1956 at the age of 80. A more recent famous Cat Islander is the actor Sidney Poitier, who was born in Arthur’s Town in the north. He is now non-resident Bahamian Ambassador to Japan.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
The interior of San Salvador is dotted with lakes; there is a great deal of marshy land and only one major road. Cockburn Town (pronounced “KOE-burn”) is the capital. Pride of place in the town goes to the small jail found by the main coast road. It’s now a museum because, as one resident said, “we don’t have no need for no jail.” (The opening hours are irregular.)<n>The main road leads around the circumference of the island. Heading south from Cockburn Town you’ll first come to Long Bay, the “official” site of Columbus’s landing. It is marked by a plain white cross that sits bright and stark against the azure-blue ocean on the seaward side of the road. The area has been designated as Landfall Park. Another monument, to the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, sits a little way from the cross. This depiction of the Olympic rings on a circular plinth is here because the Olympic flame was brought to San Salvador on its way to Mexico.<n>At the northeastern corner of the island is Dixon Hill Lighthouse. Built in 1856 but improved in subsequent years, it is called the last hand-operated kerosene-powered lighthouse in the Bahamas. Its beam can be seen for some 20 miles (32 km).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
Walt Disney World<n>They call it the “happiest place on earth,” which may be why more visitors now come here than to any other single attraction anywhere. Surprisingly, four of every five are adults. Disney World is styled as the most complete vacation destination in existence, offering sports, nightlife, sightseeing, shopping, camping, hotels, and restaurants all connected by an extensive, easy-to-use transportation network.<n>The heart of the complex is the 100-acre (40-hectare) Magic Kingdom, where it’s easy to confuse who’s real and who’s artificial. This is where the park began and where you can meet all your favorite Disney characters — you’ll be able to shake hands with Mickey and get a hug from Goofy. The park has seven sections, including Main Street, USA, with its re-creation of turn-of-the-century America facing the much photographed Cinderella Castle. For a gentle overview of the entire Magic Kingdom, try the aerial tramway at dusk as the lights are coming on.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
Coup and Revenge<n>On 30 September 1965, a group of army conspirators, who claimed they acted to prevent a possible coup against Sukarno, kidnapped and killed six army generals. In the following days, General Suharto, one of the most senior surviving commanders, isolated the conspirators and effectively seized power. The blame for the killings was pinned on the Communist Party, the PKI, which denied any involvement. A pogrom was then unleashed, first in Java and next in Bali, with widespread killings of suspected Communists. The Chinese minority, mainly shopkeepers, moneylenders, and other small businesspeople, were also a target. In common with the other immigrant groups, they had been compelled by law to display the flag of their country of origin, even if a century had passed since their ancestors had come to Indonesia. Throughout Indonesia, every Chinese business, marked by the flag of China, and associated in people’s minds with communism, was attacked. The numbers killed will never be known: in Bali alone the total casualties may have exceeded 60,000.<n>Sukarno’s association with the PKI led to his being forced to yield most of his powers. Only his honored role in the independence struggle saved him from trial. In 1968 Suharto took over the presidency.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-History.txt
More arduous and serious mountain treks include climbing the active volcano Gunung Batur — a trek of several hours — and the crater rim and lake of Gunung Rinjani (on Lombok), which demands at least three days to complete.<n>Massage, both relaxing and therapeutic, is a Balinese tradition that many visitors have come to enjoy. The beaches are filled with men and women offering reasonably good massage at prices that are very low. Ubud has many good massage centers that offer very professional massage treatment, including mineral baths, all for approximately US$10; hotels and resorts offer similar treatment in more pampering surroundings for considerably more.<n>Spectator Sports<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhatToDo.txt
Batik dyeing technique uses hot wax to draw or stamp a design on cloth before dipping it in the dye, so that the waxed areas are left undyed. The process can be repeated a number of times for greater complexity. Java is the source of the batik for dresses and sarongs sold in fashion shops; Balinese versions are usually much coarser. Hawkers will swear that their dress lengths of cheap printed cotton are batik. It’s easy to tell that they are not: Printed patterns don’t penetrate fully to the other side, while the real batik will show thin veins of color where the dye runs along tiny cracks in the wax (printed versions may try to simulate this). Real batik is always much more expensive. Used batik sarongs are highly prized, as their patterns are often no longer produced. Used batik can be bought for very low fixed prices at textile shops like Alec, on Jalan Legian in Kuta-Legian.<n>Endek or ikat fabrics, using threads dyed in patterns before weaving, come from Gianyar in Bali as well as other Indonesian islands. In Bali, only the weavers of Tenganan make grinsing, or double ikat, using pattern-dyed threads for both warp and weft. The genuine fabric is justifiably expensive — beware of fakes! You can find bold, primitive examples of ikat cloth, especially from islands such as Sumba, Flores, and Timor, in good textile shops.<n>Paintings: If you want a unique work of art, you’ll need to study the field. Visit the major collections to judge the standard of the best paintings, especially the Neka Museum and Museum Puri Lukisan in Ubud (see page 41) as well as the Arts Centre in Denpasar (see page 37). Don’t just assume that a high price guarantees original work.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhatToDo.txt
Bali is not a large island: you can easily get to any place on Bali in several hours. But to the Balinese, the island is their universe—a world unto itself. You will cut traveling time and get to know different areas of Bali in depth if you make overnight stays or visits of a few days in each of the island’s regions.<n>Don’t expect—and don’t even try—to rush around seeing all the temples and other cultural attractions on the island, or all those mentioned in this section. The island scenery and fleeting glimpses of everyday life are just as rewarding. Best of all is to turn a corner and find a procession, perhaps the whole population of a village, dressed in their best and blocking the road. Balinese temples, palaces, and other buildings, however exotic or exquisite, only really come to life when filled with ceremonies and the bustle of festivals. We have selected some of the most interesting and important attractions, but to truly appreciate and absorb what you see, we suggest that you take a few at a time.<n>Start as soon after dawn as possible, when it’s cool and the light is better for photography. A prompt start also gives you extra time to reach the more remote areas.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
The Southern Resorts<n>Most of Bali’s tourism is concentrated in a tiny fraction of the island, with the vast majority of visitors heading for the “big three” beaches, namely Sanur, Kuta, and Nusa Dua, all within a short drive of the airport. Some stretches of sand are so magnificent and the water so warm, it’s hard to believe that they were ignored for so long by the Balinese people, who have traditionally turned away from the sea. Now visitors come in the millions from all over the world with little in mind but sun, sand, warm seas, and watersports.<n>Sanur<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
The beach is the real reason to be here, and even though you won’t escape the hawkers, it’s a rest cure after the bustle of the town. Swim only between the flags, where Australian-style lifeguards keep watch: the undertow and currents can be hazardous. Surf shops abound.<n>Towards sunset, a golden light reflects off the sea and local people come out to stroll or paddle in the shallows. Young men play soccer on the sand or join the tourists in a volleyball game, while the eager beach masseuses rustle up a new wave of business.<n>At nightfall, new choices beckon. You can inspect Bali’s selection of shops, pick a restaurant, go on a pub crawl, or see a movie and wait for midnight when the discos get into gear.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Ubud<n>Once a magnet for foreign artists and still home to some, Ubud and the cluster of villages around it form the cultural and artistic focus of Bali. An increasing number of visitors come on day trips from the coastal resorts, but a better plan is to stay overnight or longer. There’s a wide choice of accommodations, ranging from cheap homestays and charming middle range hotels to high-priced luxury hideaways in the countryside just outside Ubud.<n>Day trippers only get to see the commercialism and chaos in Ubud’s main streets. Just a short walk away, however, you’re among the green, peaceful rice terraces and jungle-filled river gorges that have captivated Bali’s visitors for decades and are so much a part of the region’s legendary mystique.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
From Ujung, a coast road skirts the eastern tip of Bali, but it is potholed and crosses many river beds, usually dry but impassable after heavy rain. The scenery is not varied enough to make the bumpy two-hour ride to Amed worth the effort. There’s a much more beautiful alternative — taking in the raja’s second fancy creation, the water playground in the hills at Tirtagangga 5 km (3 miles) northwest of Amlapura. This water garden was only established after World War II, and despite being nearer to the eruption, it was spared serious damage. You can cool off in the spring-fed pools built for the raja’s family, and there are places to stay if you want to enjoy the refreshing air and magical dawn light. One losmen is inside the water garden area.<n>On the road north, a right fork at Culik leads eastwards to Amed, a quiet fishing and salt-panning village spread out along several kilometers of beaches. Here, many losmen (small, family-run hotels), as well as a few pleasant middle-range hotels have sprung up to serve travelers who come to snorkel and dive in the clear waters.<n>The Mountains<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Lovina Beach<n>The beaches west of Singaraja began to attract escapist travelers in the early 1970s, and simple and fairly inexpensive accommodations were built to house them. Slowly the number of visitors grew and the small homestays turned themselves into larger bungalow-type hotels. Today, tour groups come for short stays and, as everywhere in Bali, standards and prices are steadily going up. Actually, Lovina is not one village but a string of small ones, starting 6 km (4 miles) west of Singaraja and continuing for 10 km (6 miles) up the coast road. Shops, restaurants, and moneychangers are scattered along the busy stretch.<n>The beach itself is shallow and gently shelving, making it an ideal place for small children. There is calm water on the inside of the reef and good snorkeling over it. Lovina’s dark sand is less inviting than the white or golden variety at the southern resorts, and gets too hot to walk on in bare feet in the middle of the day.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
At Dencarik, to the west of Lovina, the road inland climbs a steep hill before reaching the orange-roofed building of the Buddhist monastery known as Brahma Vihara Arama. Nearby, at Banjar Tega, the warm springs (signposted Air Panas) have been piped into a public swimming pool, attractively shaded. There is a smaller and hotter pool, a natural shower, and reasonably clean changing rooms.<n>The market town of Seririt is a busy junction with one road leading across the island to Tabenan and eventually to Denpasar and the other following the coastal route westward. Celukanbawang Bay, 12 km (7 miles) from Seririt, is likely to become an important port if development plans are realized. So far there’s a wharf, but rarely a ship to be seen. After about another 25 km (16 miles) of sparsely settled shoreline, you’ll come to Pura Pulaki, an important temple recently rebuilt out of grim, black volcanic stone and frequented by hundreds of monkeys. Traces remain of older parts of the temple carved out of the cliff face, a natural aggregate of volcanic debris which quickly wears away — the pebbly beach here is the result.<n>A large part of this end of the island has been designated as the Bali Barat National Park, and the road crosses a small section of it, an area covered with woodland and scrub, with plenty of grey monkeys. The park encompasses and protects 760 sq km of true rainforests, mangrove swamps, and woodlands, and is home to over 100 species of birds (including the endangered Bali Starling), as well as many indigenous animals. Visitors to the park must be accompanied by an official park guide, and must be issued a park permit. Both guides and permits can be arranged for by travel agencies, or at the National Park Headquarters, 3 km (2 miles) south of Gillimanuk.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
From a study of their plants and animals, the 19th-century naturalist Alfred Wallace divided the Indonesian islands into a western group, regarded as part of southeast Asia, and an eastern group, which belonged geographically to Australia/Oceania. He then drew the line between the two through the deep Lombok Strait separating Bali and Lombok. The division is not quite so clear-cut now, but the basic principle of the “Wallace Line” is still accepted.<n>For many years, the island of Lombok was the domain of the Sasaks, a people who had come from the Asian mainland by way of Java and Bali. They were animists who revered the spirits they believed to be in the living things and inanimate objects around them. As Islam spread through the islands (apart from Bali) some people in Lombok adopted it in a version of their own, Wektu Telu, which retained many influences of animism. Today, a majority of people are more or less orthodox Muslims: As you travel about Lombok, you will notice many exotic country mosques with their domes and arabesque arcades, as well as the growing numbers of young women who wear robes and headscarves.<n>The first succession of Balinese invasions started in the 16th century. For a while, most of Lombok was governed from Karangasem in Bali. Later, the Balinese province in Lombok became independent, and even attempted to capture Karangasem! The beliefs of the animist-Hindu Balinese and the animist-Muslim Sasaks, however, were not always in conflict; there was a lot of intermarriage. Today the Balinese minority mainly lives in west Lombok and is influential in commerce and tourism.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
The hillside gardens and lake at Narmada, 10 km (6 miles) east of Cakranegara, were laid out for a 19th-century raja to remind him of Gunung Rinjani and its crater lake when he became too infirm to make the journey to the real mountain. The resemblance is harder to see now that an extra pool and a rectangular swimming pool have been added.<n>To the north of Narmada at Lingsar, a new spring is said to have burst into life to greet the Balinese when they came to Lombok, and they chose the site for an ecumenical temple intended to bring together people of different religions. The upper compound is reserved for the Hindus. The pool in the Wektu Telu temple is the home of big plump eels, overfed on offerings of boiled eggs which are conveniently sold by vendors at the gate. In another enclosure, the stones wound in white cloth with a yellow sash come from Gunung Rinjani, and Chinese Taoists have put mirrors there to repel the malevolent spirits.<n>At Suranadi, in the gardens just east of Lingsar, eggs are on the menu again, for the residents of a pond in the Temple of the Holy Eels. You can swim, too, in a separate spring-fed pool or at the old Dutch-built hotel. You can also play golf at the nearby country club.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
The Gilis are known for their tranquility, surrounded by sparkling waters. Snorkeling, diving, and sunning are the islands’ chief activities. The boats that ply the route from Bangsal to the islands wait for a full load of 15 to 20 people. In July and August that won’t take long, but out of season you can face a delay unless you pay for the empty places or charter a whole boat (fares are low and fixed).<n>There’s losmen or bungalow accommodations and a growing number of new, very comfortable small hotels on all three islands, as well as small stores where you can buy basic food, bottled water, and cold drinks. Warungs serve simple meals, mostly the standard Indonesian-style dishes and whatever fresh fish has come in.<n>Mountain Treks<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Catalonia’s legendary founding father also gave the budding nation its flag of four horizontal red stripes on a gold field, the oldest still in use in Europe. Legend holds that the stripes were etched in Wilfred’s blood, drawn on his shield as an escutcheon by the fingers of the Frankish king after the count had courageously defended his overlord in a battle.<n>When King Louis V refused to come to their aid against Moorish raiders, the counts of Barcelona declared their independence in 988, a date celebrated as Catalonia’s birth as a nation-state. The Catalan nation was soon enlarged through marriage and military adventure. Ramón Berenguer III (1096–1131) captured Mallorca, Ibiza, and Tarragona from the Moors and acquired the French county of Provence through his heiress wife. His successor, Ramón Berenguer IV, united Catalonia with neighboring Aragón by marriage, and his son Alfonso II became the first joint-king of Aragón and Catalonia and was known as “the Emperor of the Pyrenees.” His kingdom extended all the way to Nice. But much of this territory was lost by the next king, Alfonso’s son Peter the Catholic, who picked the losing side in the French crusade against the heretics of Albi.<n>Successive generations turned their attention towards the conquest of the Mediterranean basin. Jaume I (1213–1276), known as “the Conqueror,” consolidated control over the Balearic Islands and claimed Valencia. Pedro III (1276– 1285) annexed Sicily in 1282. Over the ensuing century, Barcelona reached the peak of its glory: Its mercantilist trade grew rapidly throughout the Mediterranean, and its territories included Sardinia, Corsica, Naples, the Roussillon in southern France, and briefly, Athens.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-History.txt
Tibidabo<n>The first bright, clear morning or late afternoon of your visit, head for Tibidabo, the 542-meter (1,778-foot) peak that overlooks Barcelona. The views of the city are breathtaking. You can clearly make out the Sagrada Familia and the grid plan of the Eixample. Families come here on summer evenings to enjoy the 1950s-style amusement park, and weekends are crowded with joggers and cyclists. You can also climb Torre de Collserola, by the English architect Sir Norman Foster, or visit the church of the Sagrat Corazón. A neo-Gothic work by Enric Sagnier, the church is surmounted by a monumental figure of Christ, one of the city’s landmarks.<n>To reach the summit take the FCG train (not the metro) to “Avda. Tibidabo” from the Plaça de Catalunya. From here a Tramvia Blau (blue tram) runs daily in the summer, Saturdays and Sundays the rest of the year, taking you up to the funicular station, past stately mansions. In five minutes the funicular (closed mid-October through February) lifts you through pine woods to the top, where you have a spectacular panorama of the city, the sea coast, and, on very clear days, both Mallorca and the Pyrenees. There are several restaurants and bars here, including Mirablau, with extraordinary views as their selling points.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
Recreation and Sports<n>Although most visitors to the capital do not come for outdoor pursuits or sports, Beijing does have a variety of recreational activities. Most international hotels maintain full-service fitness centers with exercise machines, saunas, indoor swimming pools, and other facilities such as tennis courts, with day rates for non-guests. The city parks are fine places for jogging, exercises, tai chi, walking, and other early morning workouts. Golf, bowling, and billiards are the three most popular recreational sports.<n>Beijing also offers bungee jumping (at the Shidu Bungee Jumping Facility in the Fangshan District), paintball (at Color Me Purple in Wanfangting Park), rock climbing (at the Qidagudu Climbing Club in the Xuanwu District), horseback riding (check with the Movenpick Hotel), and shooting (at the China North Shooting Range near the Great Wall Badaling — where even machine guns are for rent).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhatToDo.txt
Western Hills<n>When China’s rulers really wanted to escape the heat of the city, they went farther west than the Summer Palace to the Western Hills (Xi Shan), romantically known today as Fragrant Hills Park (Xiangshan Gong yuan). Imperial villas first dotted these hillsides — 27 km (17 miles) from Beijing — more than 800 years ago. But it was the Qing Emperor Qianlong who converted the Western Hills into a formal mountain retreat for the enjoyment of the court, complete with its own temples, lakes, gardens, and even a zoo. Late autumn is the favorite season for park visitors these days, when leaves turn a fiery red. However, locals as well as tourists come to the Western Hills year round for the natural beauty and historic sites.<n>Two renowned temples still survive in the Western Hills. Near the park’s north gate are the four great halls of the Temple of the Sleeping Buddha (Wo Fo Si). In the final hall (Wo Fo Dian) there is a 5-m (16-ft) lacquered statue of the reclining Buddha (dated 1321) about to attain nirvana.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-WhereToGo.txt
Reduced by war and the Wall to a bleak no-man’s-land, the square that was at one time the busiest in Europe has burst back into life in the most invigorating fashion. What was once a scar on the landscape, epitomizing the division of the city and country, is now a thriving arts, entertainment, shopping and business center. The impact of the towering, modern buildings, made almost predominantly from glass, is breathtaking. Investment from corporations such as Daimler-Chrysler and Sony has resulted in the construction of shopping malls, a theater, casino, a splendid hotel, cinemas, and a film museum.<n>Almost 100,000 people a day come here to marvel at the striking architecture and explore the latest attractions in this ever-changing city. The Sony Center is a vibrant entertainment complex, contained with a central courtyard under a glass ceiling. Technophiles can check out the latest gadgets at Sony’s first European department store, while film buffs will be intrigued by the exhibits at the excellent new Film Museum Berlin. A fascinating contrast to the futuristic architecture and technological content can be found in the elegant remains of the old Grandhotel Esplanade, now preserved behind glass walls.<n>The nearby Arkaden shopping center became a firm favorite with city shoppers as soon as it opened in 1998, and the cafés, casino, and theater in Marlene-Dietrich-Platz pay tribute to the city’s most famous daughter.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
Sweeping eastwards from the gate, this grand 61-m (200-ft) -wide avenue, literally named “Beneath the Linden Trees,” was Berlin’s showcase boulevard. Frederick the Great saw it as the center of his royal capital, and it became the most prestigious address in town. Some of its splendor fell victim to 19th-century building speculation, but the avenue remained fashionable until the bombs of World War II reduced it to rubble. Now the trees have been replanted and the most important buildings restored.<n>Its western end is dominated by the Russian Federation Embassy on the right as you come from Brandenburg Gate. Close by is the smartest hotel in town; the supremely elegant Hotel Adlon was recently built on the site of the original hotel of the same name, which was a 1930s Berlin legend.<n>Continuing east, you pass the unprepossessing modern façade of the Komische Oper, one of Berlin’s most important opera companies. The ugly exterior is the result of post-war reconstruction; happily, the magnificently over-the-top original gilded interior has been retained.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
Step inside the Französischer Dom to visit the Huguenot museum, or look up the stairwell to the Glockenspiel — a dizzying 48 m (159 ft) above. The Turmstuben restaurant on the fourth floor is the place to calm your shattered nerves. The Deutscher Dom now houses a fascinating exhibition, Fragen an die deutsche Geschichte (German History Under Question), which was previously in the Reichstag. This frank examination of Germany’s social and political history cleverly combines documents, photographs, and radio broadcasts to chronicle the rise of Fascism and the development of democracy. The descriptive panels are all in German, but audio guides and information booklets are available in English and French.<n>A short stroll leads to Friedrichstraße, where over 100,000 m of GDR architectural monstrosity have been demolished and replaced by a very elegant development of designer shops, offices, and apartments. French élan has come to Berlin in the form of a branch of the famous department store, Galeries Lafayette, at Quartier 207. The sophisticated Art Deco styling of Quartier 206, home to some very exclusive designer boutiques, is the work of Americans Pen, Cobb, Freed, and Partners.<n>Walking along Friedrichstraße, you can only marvel at the changes that have been made here since reunification. Nowhere is this brought home more strongly than at Checkpoint Charlie, that infamous border crossing between East and West. Today, the barbed wire and barriers are gone, but the memories remain, housed in the fascinat-ing Haus am Checkpoint Charlie Museum.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
On the Grunewald’s west side, along Havelchaussee, the Grunewaldturm (Grunewald Tower) is a Neo-Gothic tower built in 1897 to commemorate the 100th birthday of King Wilhelm I. You can climb the 205 steps to reach the 55-m- (180-ft- ) high observation platform for views as far as Potsdam. Ferry stations in the area offer boat rides on the River Havel and forest lakes, and the east bank of the Havel is lined with sandy beaches as far as the Wannsee lakes.<n>The waterfront near Wannsee S-Bahn station is a crowded spot where city-dwellers come and let their hair down on warm spring and summer days. The water bustles with pleasure boats and ferries, and you can cruise all the way to Spandau and Potsdam from here. Strandbad Wannsee is Berlin’s biggest beach, and the longest inland one in Europe.<n>West of the Großer Wannsee, Königstraße crosses Berliner Forst, an extension of the Grunewald to Glienicke Park. Its whimsical landscaping of little hills, bridges, and ponds was the work of Peter Josef Lenné in the early 19th century. Schloß Glienicke (1828) is a rather austere Neo-Classical edifice, but the nearby cloister, villa, and garden houses add a romantic touch.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
The capital of Bermuda since 1815, Hamilton is a very small and friendly city, despite its importance in the world of finance, banking, and insurance. It is the heart of government and decision making, and because it is the only container port on the island, it is also the center of shipping and trade. Local people gravitate here for shopping and entertainment, and visitors crowd the streets in summer when the cruise ships are in town.<n>Front Street runs along the water and is the first part of town seen by cruise passengers as ships come to shore. It is the life and soul of Hamilton and a focus for many activities, especially during the summer months. A long row of pastel-painted buildings offer the best in tax-free shopping: jewelry, liquor, clothing, and crystal. Explore the narrow alleyways that lead off Front Street to discover small shops selling collectibles or locally designed arts and crafts, or small restaurants offering local seafood. On Front Street itself there are a number of restaurants with verandas on the first floor, where you can have a drink or meal and watch the world go by. At the west end of Front Street, on the waterfront, you will find the Visitor Service Bureau and the terminal for the local ferries that ply across Great and Little Sound from Hamilton to the southern and western parts of Bermuda.<n>On summer evenings, Front Street comes alive with Harbour Night. Street performers, craft stalls, and late-night shopping are all part of the festivities. There is also the Beat Retreat Ceremony, where the Band and Corps of Drums of the Bermuda Regiment and the Bermuda Islands Pipe Band, in full military dress, march the street to recreate a centuries-old ceremony.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
The journey out of Hamilton to the south leads through the parishes of Paget, Warwick, and Southampton before reaching Sandys Parish, where the “hook” of Bermuda curves up to Somerset and Ireland islands. The south coast has miles of sublime pink-sand beaches and a reef wall that parallels the coastline. After the spectacular panorama viewed from Gibb’s Hill Lighthouse (on one of Bermuda’s highest points), the land narrows to a string of small islands held together by a series of small bridges leading eventually to the sites of Britain’s former glory.<n>Leave Hamilton by traveling east on Front Street — with the harbor on your right — until you reach a traffic circle (roundabout). Take the “Foot of the Lane,” then turn onto Pomander Road to reach Waterville, a historic home and now headquarters for the Bermuda National Trust. The home belonged to the Trimingham family, prominent business people and traders who still operate the best-known department store chain on the island. James Harvey Trimingham began trading from the Waterville site in 1842 and opened the Front Street Store (still in business) in 1861. The house, one of the oldest on Bermuda, was built around 1725 on land bought by John Trimingham II. Originally, the family built ships and operated a wharf in front of the house, “at the foot of the Lane,” as the end of Hamilton Harbour was then known. The bottom floor of the house was used to store goods and equipment, while the upper floor provided living quarters. In 1961 the house was acquired by the Historic Monuments Trust, precursor to the Bermuda National Trust, but it was still occupied by elderly Trimingham family members until 1990. Two rooms on the upper level are open to the public, where Trimingham furniture and family portraits can be seen. Just as popular are the gardens, set against the water’s edge. A 300-year-old tamarind tree sheds comforting shade over the house, and ducks come from the water to share your sandwiches.<n>If you turn up Berry Hill Road at the same roundabout, you will find the entrance to the Botanical Gardens and Camden (bus route #1). Camden was designated as the official residence of Bermuda’s premier after self-government began in 1970. It is an impressive colonial building with painted shutters and fretwork. The Botanical Gardens that surround the house were inaugurated in 1898 and doubled in size to 15 hectares (36 acres) in 1921. There are large glass houses with cacti and orchids along with formal gardens, lawns, and an aromatic garden designed for the enjoyment of blind visitors. There are also tables under the trees in the rolling landscape in front of Camden for picnics. The whole area is a delight for plant lovers and anyone else who wants a pleasant spot to relax.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
The South Road<n>You will come first to the Elbow Beach Resort and the nearby public Bermuda Beach. The resort is one of the premier hotels on the island and sits on a long stretch of sand that is for hotel guests exclusively. South Road travels on top of the cliffs and offers beautiful views of the sand dunes and beaches below. Don’t worry about trying to take in these views while driving, for there are many stopping places along the way where you can take photographs or simply enjoy the panorama. The way to each beach is marked with a wooden sign, which leads to parking areas for bicycles and cars off the main road.<n>Once you reach Warwick Long Bay there are a series of public beaches that allow you to walk along the sand or find a patch to call your own for the day. Miles of footpaths in the dunes and undulating grassland behind the beaches have been designated as South Shore Park. These areas are perfect for walking, jogging, or horseback riding (see box opposite).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
The road into Somerset Island leads around a pretty bay and onto Fort Scaur, which stands on a rocky hillock hidden from the road. The fort was begun in 1869 to protect the land route to the naval dockyard at the end of the island. The layout is the so-called Prussian design, a polygon shape developed by German engineers at the time. The gunning placements held “disappearing” guns, which could not be seen from land or sea. Other gunning placements were also added by US engineers during World War II. A sturdy caponier (a small fortified room with openings for rifles) was to act as a last defense if the battlements were overrun. It was never needed, as the fort never saw any action, and today the ramparts offer panoramic views of Great Sound. There are 9 hectares (22 acres) of grassland all around the fort where you can enjoy a picnic.<n>Just beyond the fort, watch out for a narrow lane to the right with a sign for the Heydon Trust Chapel. This simple place of worship, on land set aside for personal reflection, is open at all hours for those who want to come and pray. (The building is listed on maps of 1616 as a personal residence.) Visitors can admire the architecture and see the old water storage tank that collects water for use inside.<n>The village of Somerset lies only half a mile beyond the fort. It is a small settlement but has many shops that are branches of larger Hamilton stores and also a couple of well-regarded restaurants for a leisurely lunch.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
Taking Cavendish Road out of Hamilton leads to Middle Road, which runs through the widest section of land in Bermuda. Although they are never more than a mile from the sea, the people who live here are considered country dwellers by those who live on the coast.<n>You will come first to the Arboretum (bus route #3), 9 hectares (22 acres) of lawns and woods filled with native trees. Separate swathes of land concentrate on collections of ficus and palms, with an area of general woodland beyond. It’s a great place for children to run wild or explore in the undergrowth.<n>Less than a mile past the Arboretum, you will find two churches on the right side of the road, backed by hundreds of white painted family tombs on the hillside. The larger building first catches the eye, but it is the smaller whitewashed Old Devonshire Church that holds the interest. The church originally erected here in 1716 was totally destroyed by a mysterious explosion on Easter Sunday, 31 March 1970. The building on the site today is an exact replica of the original and was built with money collected by public donation. The very simple interior provides the perfect environment for quiet reflection and prayer.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
South Road comes to an abrupt end at Tucker’s Town Bay, a small jetty and inlet with yachts bobbing gently in the water. To get across Castle Harbour to St. George’s, you must go north here, taking Paynter’s Road to Harrington Sound. Then drive up along Harrington Sound Road to reach the Causeway to St. George’s.<n>On your way up Harrington Sound Road, you will come to Lemington Caves, a series of caves smaller than Crystal Caves but equally spectacular. Watch also for Walsingham Lane and a sign to Tom Moore’s Tavern, named after the Irish poet who spent some time on Bermuda. The tavern (which is in fact a restaurant with French and local cuisine) is open only in the evening. In the daytime you can visit Idwal Hughes Nature Reserve, also along Walsingham Lane — a pristine area of natural habitat. Collapsed limestone caves and tidal seawater mangrove swamps provide a perfect home for herons, tropical frogs, and many species of fish.<n>East End: St. George’s and St. David’s Islands<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
Around the corner in Featherbed Alley, you will find Featherbed Alley Printery, a small museum with a working model of the Gutenberg printing press first brought from England by Joseph Stockdale in 1783 and used to produce the Bermuda Gazette — first issued on 17 January 1784. The building where the paper was originally printed is the Stockdale House, on the corner of Printer’s Alley and Needle and Thread Alley. Stockdale was an extremely industrious man and also a man of foresight, as he also organized and ran the first postal service on the island.<n>Continue along Duke of Kent Street and you will come to the Unfinished Church, an elegant edifice originally begun in the 1870s when St. Peter’s Church was badly damaged by a storm and thought to be beyond repair. As construction proceeded, however, the local population decided that they would rather invest their money in repairing the old church and work on the unfinished church was immediately stopped. Had the church been completed, it would have been a fitting place of worship.<n>Continue to the right of the Unfinished Church, up Government Hill Road and through the rolling fairways of St. George’s Golf Course, one of the most challenging on the island, until you reach the coast. Here you will find Tobacco Bay, a small stretch of sheltered beach popular with the cruise passengers who disembark at St. George’s and want to spend time sunbathing. It was here in 1775 that 100 barrels of gunpowder mysteriously disappeared from stores in Fort St. Catherine and found their way onto a boat bound for the use of the American revolutionaries.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
The Esplanade<n>Explore westwards from Charles Street, and you’ll come to the Esplanade, a long narrow park along the Charles River. Here Bostonians enjoy jogging, walking, cycling, in-line skating, or just watching the river life. The much-loved Boston Pops Orchestra performs in the Art Deco Hatch Memorial Shell during July; the 4th of July performance is a knockout (see page 84).<n>Along the Downtown Freedom trail to Downtown Crossing<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
Faneuil Hall Marketplace<n>Annually 14 million visitors come to Faneuil Hall, the great “Cradle of Liberty” and marketplace. It’s very commercial, but very alluring and one of the most successful restorations anywhere.<n>Huguenot merchant Peter Faneuil (pronounced fannel, fan’l or funnel), gave it to the city in 1742. The original, consisting of a town hall above and a market below was burned down in 1762, but was swiftly rebuilt. Here on the second floor Boston’s great orators raised their voices against British tyranny, against slavery, and female oppression. It’s still used for meetings and assemblies. The vast painting behind the stage shows Daniel Webster and John Calhoun arguing over the Union. On the third floor the Museum of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, the oldest militia in the nation founded in 1637, displays historic flags, paintings, and military memorabilia (open Monday–Friday, 9am–5pm). The building’s most legendary feature is the grasshopper weathervane. No one knows really why tinsmith Shem Drowne chose the grasshopper motif, although some say it symbolizes good fortune. In 1805 Charles Bulfinch enlarged the hall.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt

In 1805 Charles Bulfinch enlarged the hall.<n>Across the plaza from Fanueil Hall the three Quincy market buildings fill with crowds of locals and visitors, who come to feast on chowder, seafood, deli sandwiches, pizza, and an array of ethnic cuisines. They also come to shop at the stalls, the flower market, and the stores, to watch the street entertainers and to sample the nightlife. One restaurant in particular draws folks — Durgin Park, which offers Yankee cuisine, communal dining, and tough no-nonsense waitresses. When they were built in 1826, these buildings stood on the waterfront. Older Bostonians can still recall the stench of rancid meat emanating from them on a hot summer’s day and the gradual decay of the area before they were restored in the late 1970s.<n>Blackstone Block and the New England Holocaust Memorial<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
The Chic and the Victorian<n>A stroll along Newbury Street — the city’s most expensive real estate — is the most civilized and congenial of Boston experiences. This is where the chic and the conservative come to furnish their homes with art and antiques, wrap their bodies in designer fashion, have their hair styled in upmarket salons, and wine, dine, and drink iced coffee al fresco in summer. Image and appearance take center stage here, both in the showcase windows and the personas of the people looking at them. Every display — whether of fine art, ice cream, or fashion — is worth a picture. Some of the galleries exhibit works by major artists. Notice the architecture as well: At the end of the converted carriage houses, the less genteel eastern end gives way to series of alternate classic bow- and flat-fronted townhouses.<n>Take a detour along the way down one of the side streets, alphabetically arranged from A to H, starting at the Public Garden (they’re named after English peers). In between the avenues, look out for the narrow, arrow-straight service alleys that form the entranceway to the old servants’ quarters at the backs of the houses. The strip which is lined with elms and runs down the spine of Commonwealth Avenue is the perfect vantage point on which to stand back and gaze at the ornate Victorian buildings built in a range of styles — French Second Empire, Victorian Gothic, and Renaissance Revival. Detour to see the mansion designed by McKim Mead & White for John F. Andrew at 32 Hereford Street and to the building that housed the original Fannie Farmer Cooking School at 40 Hereford Street. You can get a wonderful sense of life in a Victorian Back Bay home at the Gibson House, at 137 Beacon Street, (open for tours May–October, Wednesday–Sunday at 1, 2, and 3pm, weekends the rest of the year). The contents of the house — imported carpets, plush Turkish ottomans — are the fascinating and colorful legacy of three generations of Gibsons, who lived here from 1860 to 1954.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
The few blocks of tiny Bay Village lie well hidden in between the Theater District and Back Bay, around Winchester, Melrose, and Fayette streets. It feels somewhat like a toy village — a miniature, flat version of Beacon Hill — with similar red-brick and black-shuttered homes lining sidewalks that are shaded by trees and lit by old-fashioned street lamps. These were the homes of artisans, not Brahmins, and are less precious, devoid of cornices and fancy wrought iron. When the marsh of Back Bay was filled in during the 1860s, water flooded into this area, forcing the streets and houses to be raised on pilings.<n>Take Tremont Street south and cross over the Massachusetts Turnpike into the South End. Come if only to savor one (or more) of its great restaurants, a clutch of chic bistros on Tremont Street around Clarendon. Like so much of Boston, the South End began as a landfill project, but it soon lost out in desirability to Back Bay. A multi-ethnic mix of Hispanic, Irish, West Indian, and Greek, the community is also home to Boston’s largest gay community. Some districts — to the south of Shawmut Avenue, for example — are best avoided. In others, though, you will come across bright community murals and perhaps a reggae band playing in a local park.<n>The neighborhood boasts (justifiably) a fine concentration of Victorian terraced residences. Bow brick houses, their steep stoops (or steps) framed with scrolled black railings, are set off by parks, the finest examples being Union Park Square, situated just off Tremont Street, and Rutland and Concord squares both farther to the south.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
There’s an even better view from the top of the 253-ft (77-m) Pilgrim Monument in Provincetown. It’s called the Pilgrim monument because this is where the Pilgrims actually landed first before moving on to Plymouth. The museum at the base of the tower tells the story.<n>P-Town, is a fabled place. Although the main street is crowded and lined with commercial tourist trinket stores, it still has a magical atmosphere, because it has an “anything goes” attitude. It is the East Coast’s gay mecca (along with the Hamptons, and Cherry Grove and the Pines on Fire Island). Same-sex couples walk the streets hand in hand, and outrageous transvestites entertain in the cabarets. Families come to browse the stores selling T-shirts, and scrimshaw and driftwood curios, and to enjoy the beaches and the fishing and whale-watch trips. In the early 20th century Provincetown was a major art colony and there are still numerous art galleries, particularly at the east end of town.<n>In summer, the town is swamped and every guesthouse filled. In winter, it’s quiet. Many of the commercial stores close and only the residents remain — a community of artists, Portuguese fishermen, and a handful of restaurateurs. You can visit Provincetown for a day (see page 110), but if you don’t stay longer, you’ll miss half the fun.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt

Uri utca terminates at Dísz tér, where it’s best to turn and walk back along Tárnok utca. Among the shops and restaurants here are a number of ﬁne buildings. The orange-and-red geometric frescoes painted on the overhanging ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Aranyhordó (Golden Barrel) restaurant are the most noteworthy. Next door, number 18 was built as a merchant’s house in the ﬁrst half of the 15th century. Used as the Arany Sas (Golden Eagle) pharmacy from 1750 until 1913, it is now the most attractive of this area’s small museums. Beautiful old majolica vessels are the stars of an atmospheric re-creation of the pharmacy, and there are also informative displays on potions, practices, and alchemy in the Budapest of this era.<n>The ﬁnal street of this district to be explored is the leafy Tóth Arpád sétány. This promenade, situated along the western ramparts, offers views of the Buda Hills and the huge Southern Railway Station (Déli pályaudavar) rather than a glorious Danube panorama. Nonetheless, this is a delightful stroll, particularly in early evening, when the locals come out to enjoy the fresh air. At the northern end, various cannon signal the entrance to the Museum of Military History (Hadtörténeti Múzeum). It’s an extensive exhibition and popular with school-children, but the section dedicated to the 1956 uprising is the most memorable for older visitors.<n>The Royal Palace<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
Margaret Island (Margit-sziget)<n>The elite of the Roman empire escaped everyday cares on this leafy oasis between the two banks, and in later eras princes and plutocrats did likewise. Today wealthy tourists enjoy the thermal facilities and treatments offered at the two international-class hotels on the island. The leisure establishment of most interest to visitors is the huge outdoor Palatinus Baths (Palatinus strand) which includes thermal pools and boasts a capacity of 20,000 swimmers and sunbathers. The island is not just for tourists, however: Budapestis of all ages come here to walk, run, swim, play tennis or team games, or simply sunbathe. It’s also a famous spot for courting couples.<n>The island is 2 km (11⁄2 miles) long and only a few hundred yards at the widest part. Many of its estimated population of 10,000 trees are now more than a century old, and large areas of the island are lawned and landscaped. Best of all, cars (with a few exceptions) are prohibited, thus preserving the island’s peace and quiet.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
Váci utca runs into the ever-busy, yet somehow relaxed, Vörösmarty tér. This is one of Pest’s favourite gathering places, often lined with craft stalls and resounding to a brass band. After a browse through Luxus department store, it’s probably time for coffee and cakes at Gerbeaud, doyen of Budapest’s coffee-house scene since 1884. If the sumptuous high-ceilinged interior is a little too formal for your liking, then take a terrace seat and watch the world go by.<n>Stroll a few yards towards the river and you will come to yet another pleasant and lively square, Vigadó tér, which has the advantage of a riverside location with Castle Hill views. Here, too, you will find craft stalls and any number of buskers. A vibrant café-restaurant comprises one side of the square, but the dominant building is the splendid Vigadó theatre. The interior hall is an acoustically perfect auditorium renovated in 1980 (its predecessors having twice perished in war and revolution), but the façade has been gloriously restored in mid-19th-century Hungarian-Eastern style. The list of performers and conductors who have graced the Vigadó theatre is an impressive Who’s Who of the past 150 years of European classical music: Liszt, Brahms, Wagner, Mahler, Bartók, Prokoﬁev, Casals, Björling, and von Karajan.<n>This is also the centre of what may be called “the Hotel Zone,” with four luxury hotels within a very short distance of each other. Their architecture has done nothing for the aesthetics of the embankment viewed from the Buda side of the river, but, ironically, looking in the opposite direction, they provide some of the ﬁnest views of the city.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
If you want a change from museums and galleries, a 4-km (21⁄2-mile) trip out of town brings you to a great place for historic films, the Hungarian Open Air Village Museum (Sza-badtéri Néprajzi Múzeum), which is an offshoot of the Ethnographical Museum. Catch the number 8 bus departing from the terminal next to the HEV station, and ask for the “Skanzen.” There are also regular buses from the Tourinform ofﬁce, on the road from the bus station to the centre.<n>The 46-hectare (115-acre) museum site will eventually contain ten “villages” of real houses, churches, mills, farm buildings, workshops, and smithys, dating mostly from the late 18th to the early 20th century, and culled from all over Hungary. At present there are only three settlements to view, but even these will occupy you for at least half a day and possibly longer. It is a fascinating and picturesque simulation of old rural Hungary, brought to life by active craftspeople, gingerbread makers, and other “rural folk.” (Try to come on the ﬁrst or third Sunday of the month, when there are several different craft demonstrations.) An excellent guide book giving the general history of the villages and buildings, and details about individual interiors, is available for purchase.<n>Don’t miss climbing up the hill to visit the Greek Catholic Church from Mándok (in northeast Hungary), originally built in 1670, and boasting a painted iconostasis. The village is closed from November to April.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
The North Shore<n>Driving from Budapest and navigating the lake in an counter-clockwise direction (along the perimeter Highway 71), the ﬁrst settlement of any size is at Balatonalmádi. There is a medieval chapel in the parish church, but most people come here to enjoy the beach — the biggest and one of the best-equipped along the northern shore, with space for 12,000 sunbathing bodies. Signs for the beach read strand, but that won’t guarantee you a sandy or even pebbly foreshore — it simply means the lake edge, which may be sand, lawn, or even concrete.<n>Balatonfüred, some 13 km (8 miles) farther west, has a history as a spa stretching back to Roman times. The main square, called Gyógy tér (meaning Health/Therapeutic Square), is a handsome place where the local mineral water bubbles up from the ground beneath a pagoda-like well-head. On three sides of the square stand grand old buildings: the 18th-century Horváth House, once an inn, now a miner’s sanatorium; the Trade Union Sanatorium of 1802, and the Cardiac Hospital, which has treated heart patients from all over the world. The small grove in front of the square has a number of trees dedicated by personalities who have visited here, including Indira Gandhi.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
The American Pioneers<n>The first Americans to come to California from the eastern states were Boston fur traders taking the Cape Horn route at the end of the 18th century. They didn’t stay for long, but gradually other traders and fur trappers began to arrive overland through Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, settling only in small numbers until the famous covered wagons began their heroic treks of the 1840s. The hardships the pioneers suffered in the Sierra Nevada mountains, Death Valley, and the Mojave Desert became the stuff of California legend, the most tragic being the fate of 87 pioneers who set out from Illinois in 1846. While attempting to cross the Sierra Nevada, George Donner’s wagon train became snowed in, and from November until February was stuck high in the mountains north of Lake Tahoe, at a point now known as the Donner Pass. Just 47 people survived, and then only by resorting to cannibalism.<n>Just simple farmers seeking a place in the sun to work a piece of land, the pioneers came at a time when territorial expansion was much in vogue — the French in the Pacific and Algeria, the British in Africa and the Far East. The United States was eager to get in on the act and so, during the war with Mexico over the annexation of Texas, California was suddenly regarded as a useful addition to the spoils. United States forces captured Los Angeles in 1847, and the Mexicans capitulated at Cahuenga. A treaty of American annexation of California was signed on 2 February 1848. Meanwhile, unknown to the American and Mexican signatories, gold had been found in the Sierra Nevada foothills only nine days earlier.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-History.txt
The reform movement, intent on breaking the political power of the big corporations, attacked corrupt practices in administration, public finances, and banking, but did nothing to oppose the businessmen’s traditional resistance to unions and more liberal labor laws. There was also a campaign of official discrimination against Chinese and Japanese immigrants, excluding them from owning land and preventing further immigration.<n>All kinds of produce grew large and lush in California’s fertile, irrigated soil, but the most financially profitable thing to come out of the Californian earth was oil. Drilling had begun in the 1860s but didn’t take off until 1892. By the 1920s, the derricks of the Standard, Union, and Shell oil companies had sprouted all over the Los Angeles basin. In that one decade, the state’s oil revenues were $2.5 billion, $500 million more than all the gold the Sierras yielded in a century.<n>Sunny, oil-rich Los Angeles was therefore the perfect place for the car to emerge as an everyday household accessory. From 1920 to 1930 L.A.’s population more than doubled, and the number of private cars increased fivefold. Noting the central position of the “pursuit of happiness” in America’s Declaration of Independence, the Los Angeles Times asked in 1926: “How can one pursue happiness by any swifter and surer means than by the use of the automobile?”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-History.txt
Watersports<n>If you get no other exercise while you’re in California, it would be difficult to go without at least one day of swimming at the beach. It’s no coincidence that most of the United States’ champion swimmers come from Southern California. In the middle-class neighborhoods of Los Angeles county it seems that every other house has its own swimming pool — from the air you see the mass of turquoise blobs as you fly into the airport.<n>Surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, sailing, fishing, waterskiing, and windsurfing can all be enjoyed at various points on the coast. Everyone has their favorite beach or bay, and some are better for one sport than another.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhatToDo.txt
Thunder Bay<n>For vacationers, this town strategically located on Lake Superior’s northwest shore is a springboard to the national parks of Ontario’s interior. But it’s also worth taking a look first at the impressive port facilities of this western terminus of the St. Lawrence–Great Lakes Seaway, which has given Thunder Bay its second name: the Lakehead. Freighters come 3,200 km (1,920 miles) inland from the Atlantic to take on grain shipments from the Prairie Provinces or bring other heavy cargo to all points west in both Canada and the United States. Starting out from the centrally located North Marina, a harbor cruise takes you around the gigantic fortress-like grain silos for a close-up view of the ships in dock. A longer cruise from the same marina follows the Kaministikwia River to Old Fort William (20 minutes by car), the handsomely reconstructed trading post of the Nor’Westers, intrepid rivals of the Hudson’s Bay Company (see page 16). Sheep graze the courtyard lawns, bread is still made in the bakery, and the cookhouse provides lusty country fare. In the company store you’ll see the kind of simple copper and pewter utensils and steel knives that were more precious than gold to the Midéwiwin Indians bringing in their beaver pelts.<n>Just up the road, 40 km (25 miles) northwest of Thunder Bay, the beautiful Kakabeka Falls is surrounded by its own provincial park providing a quiet natural setting that’s a far cry from Niagara. A boardwalk takes you through the woods along the Kaministikwia River and across a bridge for a view of the falls from both sides. The 151-m (154-ft) cascade flows at its fullest in spring and autumn when the hydrostations don’t slow it down. There are good facilities for camping and bathing.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The 19th-century exhibits include works by Turner, Constable, Pissarro, Monet, Dégas, and Cézanne. Klimt and James Ensor provide the transition to the 20th century, well represented by Matisse, Picasso, Braque, and Francis Bacon.<n>Contemporary Art. The collections in which American artists come to the fore present works by Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman, Kenneth Noland, the Pop Art of James Rosenquist, Andy Warhol, and Claes Oldenburg, the Minimalist sculpture of Donald Judd and Dan Flavin, and Conceptualists such as Solo Lewitt and Joseph Kosuth. The most important of contemporary Canadians here include Guido Molinari, Yves Gaucher, and Michael Snow.<n>Canadian Collections. Besides some classics of the 19th century evoking the life and landscapes of the early settlement, the best works are from Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven (see page 63). Look for Thomson’s Jack Pine, A. Y. Jackson’s Red Maple, Lawren Harris’s North Shore, Lake Superior, murals by Thomson, Arthur Lismer, and J. E. H. MacDonald, and Emily Carr’s Indian Hut, Queen Charlotte Islands. Inuit Art has some impressive sculpture, prints, and drawings from the 1950s and 1960s. The museum also houses the reconstructed Rideau Convent Chapel, a fine example of French-Canadian 19th-century architecture.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Upper Canada Village<n>Here, 86 km (53 miles) southeast of Ottawa, the two strands of the region’s history come together in the meticulous recreation of a 19th-century pioneering village, perhaps the best of the country’s many historical showpieces. The homes of the region’s first settlers had to be moved here, east of Morrisburg, when their original location was flooded in the digging of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Start your visit by climbing the small fort tower, from which you get an overall view. In a peaceful, green canalside setting disturbed only by perky Canada geese, notoriously loud honkers, you’ll find authentic pre-1867 buildings, from the simple timbered sawmill or old schoolhouse to the sophisticated brick-built Crysler Hall in the Palladian style favored by colonial land owners from Ontario to Alabama. Crysler was a farmer on whose land an important battle was fought in the War of 1812, marked by a monument beside the village.<n>Period-costumed artisans demonstrate the crafts of the village: weaving, bread-baking, plowing, and sowing. In the colonial setting of Willard’s Hotel, you can enjoy a home-cooked hot meal or salad lunch.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Diagonally opposite the Hôtel de Ville on rue Notre-Dame, the Château Ramezay was home of the French governor Claude de Ramezay from 1705 to 1724. It passed successively into the hands of the French West Indies Trading Company (to store its spices), the British, and, during their brief occupation of the city in 1775, the American generals Richard Montgomery and Benedict Arnold. Benjamin Franklin stayed here during his fruitless attempt to win Québec over to the American cause. After years of neglect, the château has been restored and transformed into a museum showing a more comfortable side of frontier life in New France: elegant 18th-century furnishings, a grand colonial kitchen in the basement, and the nice added touch of magnificent carved mahogany paneling imported from the old trading company’s French offices. Iroquois clothes and artifacts give a hint of life outside the stockade.<n>The rue Bonsecours is one of the principal historic residential streets leading from rue Notre-Dame towards the Vieux Port (Old Port). The Maison Papineau (Number 440), distinguished by its double row of gabled garrets in the roof, dates back to 1785. It is the family home of the controversial 19th-century politician Louis-Joseph Papineau, leader of the militant patriotes but also cautious protector of his seigneurial property (see page 19). In 1837, the house nearly burned down in a violent riot, and British soldiers had to come to Papineau’s rescue. He fled to the countryside and did not take part in the subsequent insurrection.<n>On the corner of rue St-Paul, the older Maison du Calvet was built in 1725 by a prominent Huguenot merchant. As a Protestant, Pierre du Calvet was appointed by the British justice of the peace but then ended up in jail himself for selling supplies and information to the American invaders. With its broad chimney, fine-grained limestone frames around the doors, and gracefully tapered casement windows, the house is one of the more handsome architectural specimens of the French colonial era. The sturdy interior of wide, rough-hewn floorboards and massive pinewood roofbeams is fitted out from the Montréal Museum of Fine Arts with antique Québec furniture, rugs, lanterns, clocks, and porcelain appropriate to the life of a wealthy 18th-century businessman. A framed copy of the bilingual Québec Gazette, dating from 1786, suggests that colonials of the New World had an uncommon interest in the more arcane news of international events in the Old World, such as Turkey’s troubles with Venice or the quarrels of the Dutch royal family.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Founded in the early 19th century by a Scottish fur trader, James McGill, and especially respected for its engineering and medicine faculties, it has a student enrollment of 15,000. In 1969, Québécois separatists staged violent but unsuccessful demonstrations to have it transformed into a French-speaking institution. (The city’s other English-speaking college is Concordia while the Université de Montréal and the Université du Québec à Montréal are both French-speaking).<n>Between Maisonneuve and R. Lévesque boulevards, art and commerce come together at the Place des Arts and Complexe Desjardins. The modern cultural center is comprised of a concert hall, two theaters, and a recital room for chamber music. At the Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier, 175 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest, home of the Montréal Symphony Orchestra, the elegant tone of the whole complex is set in the foyer decorated with Aubusson tapestries and sculptures in bronze, mahogany, aluminum, and ceramics. Notice above the concert hall doors the soapstone carvings of the Inuit sculptor Yununkpuk.<n>Across rue Ste-Catherine, you pass through the imposing glass portals of the attractive multilevel shopping center of Complexe Desjardins, opened in 1976 during the grand building spree of the Montréal Olympic Games.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
At the tip of the peninsula, Forillon National Park offers great facilities for fishing, boat cruises, skin-diving (wetsuits are obligatory), and hiking. In this most spectacular of land- and seascapes, even the least artistic of you will be tempted to take up painting or at least photography. Look out for the whales and grey seals in the gulf. Wildlife inside the park includes fat little porcupine, hare, red squirrel, deer, moose and an occasional bear, lynx, and fox. Birdwatchers have 200 species to feast their eyes on, with guillemots and cormorants among the easier to spot. The town of Gaspé makes its livelihood from fishing — cod and herring. It offers good opportunities for sailing and windsurfing (again, wetsuits obligatory). On the rue du Monument is a granite cross commemorating the wooden cross that Jacques Cartier planted on behalf of his French sovereign in front of a bemused audience of Iroquois.<n>The best hotels are in the resort town of Percé, so this is naturally the most crowded place on the peninsula. People come for watersports and to marvel at the cliffs pierced (percé) by the sea. Erosion originally created two arches in the 94-m- (82-ft-) high rocks, but one has since crumbled. See them at sunrise when they’re pink. Take a cruise around Bonaventure Island to view the penguins and puffins.<n>THE ATLANTIC<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The drive over Lions Gate Bridge to Vancouver’s North Shore suburbs along Marine Drive and the Upper Levels Highway (Route 99) makes a gentle introduction to your exploration of the Pacific coast and interior. With a view of the ocean from a setting of tall Douglas firs and red cedars among boulders, and the occasional swift mountain stream, the elegant or rustic houses enjoy a civilized microcosm of the classical B.C. landscape.<n>Route 99 turns north at Horseshoe Bay (landing area for the Vancouver Island ferry) to become the Squamish Highway for a spectacular 100-km (60-mile) drive up to Whistler Mountain. The Coastal Mountains come right down to the water’s edge of the narrow Howe Sound, some forming a little archipelago in the sea.<n>Stop off at Shannon Falls, a short walk away from the road on an easy gravel path over footbridges into the forest. You can picnic at the bottom of the cliff over which the water cascades. Famous for its August log-rolling contests, the town of Squamish makes a useful base for hiking tours into Garibaldi Provincial Park. The winter sports resort of Whistler offers excellent summer facilities, too: bicycles, kayak and river-rafting or more sedate swimming, golf, and tennis. Take the ski-lift for views across the Coastal Mountains or stroll around Lost Lake — good trout-fishing — but beware of a pretty yellow flower known as skunk cabbage that smells like its name when you pick it.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Turn north at Hope to Yale, an old fort of the Hudson’s Bay Company, terminus of its stern-wheelers unable to negotiate the rapids upriver — at low water you can still see their ring tie-ups on the river bank. A little museum documents how this sleepy village of a few hundred inhabitants was once a gold rush boomtown and the major construction depot for the C.P.R.<n>The strands of B.C.’s destiny come together where the Fraser Canyon narrows at the torrential rapids of Hell’s Gate. For thousands of years, this point in the river’s descent to the ocean was the local native peoples’ favored fishing spot for the salmon swimming to their spawning grounds. It was here in 1808 that they helped Nor’Wester fur trader Simon Fraser with his canoe past the rapids, over a swaying ropeway of vines strung along the canyon wall, enabling him to follow to the ocean the river that bears his name. In 1914, the C.N.R. blocked the salmon’s passage with rock-blasts through the canyon for the railway. The consequent 90 percent reduction of the annual sockeye salmon catch was remedied only 30 years later when multimillion-dollar steel-and-concrete channels were built for the fish. The native peoples are back again in areas like this, leaning far out over precarious rocky ledges to pluck with dip nets just a tiny amount of salmon, compared with the millions caught by the commercial fisheries at the Fraser estuary. Take the cable car across the gorge for a close-up view of the rapids. For a taste of what the fuss is all about, try a grilled salmon lunch at the restaurant by the cable-car terminal.<n>The Thompson River joins the Fraser at Lytton. Before turning east on the Trans-Canada Highway to follow the Thompson, take a look (just north of town on Highway 12) at the dramatic effect of the confluence mixing the lime of the tributary with the clearer mountain waters of the Fraser. The drier Thompson valley soon takes on a more rugged aspect than the Fraser, with the sagebrush and lizards of a semi-desert, in places as beautifully desolate as a moonscape. The similarity with America’s southwest is reinforced by the ranches around Kamloops Lake.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
In this region, the great Canadian outdoors really comes into its own. The national parks of the Rocky Mountains provide unrivaled opportunities for exhilarating contacts with a wilderness where you can really escape from your fellow man: camping and hiking through the forests; fishing in the myriad lakes and rivers; canoeing and whitewater rafting in the mountain torrents. And skiing, downhill and cross-country, has been greatly enhanced by the ultra-modern facilities installed for Calgary’s 1988 Winter Olympics.<n>Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba form the Prairie Provinces, sharing the same rugged climate. The full meaning of Canada’s “wide open spaces” becomes instantly apparent here, in the vast stretches of wheat field reaching to the horizon. The eye is attracted not by some craggy obstacle but by the play of a sudden wind sweeping across the plain. The sky is spectacular, offering magnificent dawns and sunsets. Play the farmers’ game of watching the weather come and go.<n>Stop in the provincial capitals of Edmonton, Regina, and Winnipeg for a glimpse of the region’s history and culture. Monuments and museums show how the buffalo-hunting Métis, the descendants of Indians and French fur traders, struggled in vain against Anglo farmers from Ontario, themselves subsequently relayed by waves of Eastern European immigrants brought in to exploit the grain wealth of the prairies. One sidetrip in Manitoba touches on another Canadian adventure, up to Churchill on Hudson Bay, the center of the great fur trading company’s northern activities. A bonus in autumn is the rare “southern” appearance of polar bears.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
About 150 km (90 miles) west of Whitehorse on the Alaska Highway, the entrance to this wilderness reserve is at Haines Junction. The park’s St. Elias Mountain Range offers a challenge to climbers, including the highest peak in Canada, Mount Logan. You’ll find moose, timber wolves, black bear, and grizzlies here.<n>For safety’s sake, check in at the park reception center and get maps and information on the hiking trails covering 240 km (144 miles) of challenging terrain. The vast Kluane icefield system is made up of some 2,000 glaciers, and you can hike right to the rim of the spectacular Kaskawulsh Glacier from Kluane Lake on the eastern edge of the park. Bird-watchers spot eagles, falcons, and hawks. Fishermen come for the trout, grayling, and lake salmon.<n>Northwest Territories<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Northwest Territories<n>If you feel drawn by a rendezvous with the Midnight Sun, make for these immense lands covering one-third of Canada’s total surface, where, compared to the icy expanses inside the Arctic Circle, the tundra passes for lush meadowland. The summer, when temperatures climb to a comfortable 21°C (70°F) in Mackenzie District, offers the blessed privilege of a dazzling explosion of wild flowers. Beluga whales come out to play around Baffin Island. In autumn, the magical northern lights of the aurora borealis are at their most brilliant.<n>Yellowknife<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
The Bug Bubble burst with the rise of chemical dyes in the 1870s. With the failure of yet another mono-culture, the Spanish government felt constrained to help the Canarian economy. In the mid-19th century, free port status was granted by royal decree to one port in each of the islands (two in Tenerife). The lowering of duties and trade barriers at a time of considerable shipping expansion had the desired effect, and Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas soon became two of the world’s busiest ports.<n>The most recent major crop to come from the Canaries is bananas. The variety is the dwarf banana, small and very tasty, and today demand actually outstrips production in some areas. The first exports were made in the 1880s and the banana has continued to be a mainstay of the islands’ economy. Despite some recent problems and concern for the future, it is hoped that bananas will continue to be an important Canarian crop alongside their other staples; tomatoes and potatoes.<n>In 1912, Cabildos (Island Councils) were created and given the responsibility for the social, political and economic administration of each island, and co-ordination with the Town Halls. This led, in 1927, to the islands being divided into two provinces; Santa Cruz de Tenerife with the islands of Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro; and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria with the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-History.txt
The Spanish Civil War<n>The plot that sparked off the Spanish Civil War was hatched in the Canary Islands. In 1936 a group of senior officers, discontented with the policies of the Spanish Republican Government, met in secret in the woods of La Esperanza on Tenerife. They had come to meet a fellow officer, Francisco Franco, whom the government had banished to the Canaries for subversive plotting. From the Canaries, Franco took off for North Africa, the launching pad for the insurgent right-wing attack.<n>Three years later his armies had triumphed in a ruthless struggle that cost hundreds of thousands of Spanish lives. The Canaries were not spared the horrors of the war (mass Republican executions took place in the aptly named Barranco del Infierno, the Gorge of Hell, on Tenerife), but on the whole the islands prospered during Franco’s period of dictatorship, which provided for added protection to their free-port status.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-History.txt
Villages and groups of one kind or another dress according to chosen themes, with magnificent and often outrageous costumes that can take a whole year to put together. Bands and dancers mingle with the elaborate floats. Tourists are treated with good-natured humor, and many don masks and costumes to join in the fun. The music and dancing continue until late, with parties everywhere.<n>Carnaval is biggest and best in Santa Cruz and Puerto de la Cruz on Tenerife and in Las Palmas on Gran Canaria, where it has all the razzmatazz of Rio’s Carnaval and the Mardi Gras of New Orleans. Visitors come from all over the world for these events, and hotels are often full, so book well ahead if you plan to visit at this time of year.<n>Corpus Christi<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhatToDo.txt
The next place of interest is the Centro de Visitantes (Visitors Center) of the Parque Nacional de la Caldera de Taburiente, located at Km 23.9 on road TF-812, (open daily 9am–2pm and 4pm–6:30pm). The English brochure is quite helpful, giving general information on the geology and geomorphology, flora and fauna, helpful hints on camping as well as a very useful color diagram of the hiking possibilities. At the heart of La Palma, Caldera de Taburiente park, covering 4,690 hectares (just over 18 square miles), is a giant crater: 1,500 m (1,640 yards) deep with a diameter of 10 km (6.2 miles), and is a 20 km (12.4 miles) in circumference. It was created some 400,000 years ago and has since been colonized by nature into a green, fertile valley. The best place to see this is from the Mirador La Cumbrecita, which is 7 km (nearly 5 miles) away on the road next to the center. Following it, the road finally climbs into a craggy forest surrounded by mist-shrouded peaks with tall pines clinging to the most precarious ledges. There are wonderful views from here (weather permitting — which it doesn’t most of the time), including the Roque de los Muchachos and the monolithic Roque Idafe, said to have been the sacred altar of the first Guanche natives on the island. You can enjoy the Caldera by car, but to get the most from the area you have to walk.<n>The main road then continues west through the city of Los Llanos de Aridane and then turns south, following the mountainside, to Fuencaliente. The most southerly point on the main road, it is famous for its wines. But rather than continue directly back north on the eastern side of La Palma, take the road down to the Faro de Fuencaliente that will lead you in a near circle to the most southern tip of La Palma and then up through a winding, twisting, road back to Fuencaliente. The first stop is at the Bodegas Carballo, where you can sample and purchase some surprisingly strong local wines. In 1677 the local volcano, San Antonio, erupted covering once fertile land with ash, leaving a layer of lapilli approximately 2 m (6.5 ft) deep. By the end of that century farmers had developed a technique of digging trenches that enabled them to reach the fertile layer of earth found under the cinders, where they planted the vines that were then covered with the extracted ashes. This somehow allowed the plants to resist adverse weather conditions and even the grape plague, phylloxera, that decimated vines all over Europe in the second half of the 19th century. Just across the road you can stop to pay a visit to the edge of the volcanic crater of Volcán de San Antonio and the mirador beyond it, (open daily 8am–6pm). In an exposed, windy location this looks, considering the damage it did, exceedingly benign. Just south of here are even more recent signs of volcanic activity; the volcano of Teneguía that erupted in 1971, fortunately without casualties. These eruptions sent an ever-widening stream of molten lava rushing down the green hillside here and you can see it now, petrified and black, as the road runs right through the once deadly mass. Surprisingly, plátanos (bananas) seem to take a liking to this environment, and can be seen thriving all around you. Once down to sea level you will come across the Playa de Zamora a small beach of jet-black sand squeezed in between the surrealistic lava fields. A short distance away, next to the twin lighthouses — one old and one new — is a tiny fishermen’s cove with a stony beach that has a tiny restaurant, well, a shack really, that serves up the most delicious fresh fried fish (see page 139). After that there is nothing of note, except of course the lava fields and views, until you rejoin the main road at Fuencaliente.<n>Heading back north towards Santa Cruz, a stop at the Cueva de Belmaco is in order. Here, you will find the Parque Arqueológico de Belmaco (Archaeological Site of Belmaco). The first stone engravings found in the Canary Islands were discovered here in the 18th century, and the ten natural cave dwellings, with their magnificent rock engravings, were the home to the Benahoritas — the ancient settlers of Benahoare, the original aboriginal name for La Palma.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
From Las Palmas you have two options. The most northern route runs through the peaceful valley town of Teror. The old whitewashed houses, often built around graceful patios, boast fine traditional carved balconies. The major landmark here is a typically large Canarian church, the Basílica Nuestra Señora del Pino (Our Lady of the Pine). This commemorates the miraculous discovery in 1481, in the branches of a pine tree, of a sacred effigy. The Blessed Virgin of Teror is also the patron saint of Gran Canaria. Alternatively, take the main road that runs inland from close to the cathedral and heads southwest through the towns of Santa Brígida and Vega de San Mateo, offering panoramic views of the east of the island. Because the climate here is exceptionally mild, many Canarians and foreign residents have built very desirable homes in these hills, with the gardens around their villas often being magnificent. A small diversion along this route is certainly worthwhile. Just a few kilometers out of Las Palmas, follow the signs to Bandama, the road (open 8am–10pm) leads up to the nearby Caldera de Bandama, one of the island’s finest natural features and a spectacular mirador in its own right. This volcanic crater, almost a kilometer (more than a half mile) across, is green, fertile.and drops some 198 m (650 ft) down. A scenic spiraling road leads to the top, where the Real Club de Golf enjoys such a picturesque location that even non-golfers are tempted to pick up a club. The views from here take in the mountains, fertile valley and vast stretches of the coastline from Las Palmas to the distant south.<n>From the west of the island drive north from Agaete and then turn inland following the signs to Tejeda for a really pleasant, and not unduly difficult, mountain ascent. The valleys here are wide and their slopes play host to some small farms; it is one of the few places in the islands where you will come across farm animals. Of interest, too, are the fantastic views across the ocean on a fine day to the snowcapped Mount Teide floating majestically above the clouds and the mountain peaks and lush valleys of Gran Canaria itself. Before reaching Tejeda turn off to the village of Artenara, to the southwest, and what is undoubtedly the best restaurant view on the island. The place in question is Méson de la Silla, not easy to spot, parallel to the main road. A dark tunnel leads through the rock with no hint of what is to come, then emerges on the other side of the mountain to a bright 180-degree mountain panorama. To the left the head of the valley, green and dotted with whitewashed little villages; it leads up to Tejeda itself, but the more dramatic vistas are directly in front and to the right. Here, the scenario is dramatic indeed; jagged peaks fill the horizon and many smaller ones are spread throughout the valley giving the impression of looking down on a minor mountain range.<n>Lanzarote<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
The North of the Island<n>On an island so dominated by the works and creativity of one man, it would be inappropriate not to pay a visit to the Fundación César Manrique; Taro de Tahiche; Manrique lived here and, as you might have come to expect, it is rather unusual. Built in 1968, it is located over a river of lava formed from the eruptions between 1730 and 1736 and takes advantage, at its lowest point, of five volcanic bubbles to create the strange, but nonetheless impressive living space.<n>The geographic center of Lanzarote lies 9 km (51⁄2 miles) northwest of the capital at Mozaga, focal point of the island’s viniculture. Here the late César Manrique designed and erected a huge white modern sculpture, Monumento al Campesino, dedicated to the peasant workers of the island.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt

Here the late César Manrique designed and erected a huge white modern sculpture, Monumento al Campesino, dedicated to the peasant workers of the island.<n>A few miles north of La Santa, home to the Club La Santa a time-share development resort where athletes of the highest level come for both training and relaxation, is the tiny village of Caleta de Famara. It has windswept beaches with views of the daunting cliffs of the Famara Massif that lead up to the Mirador del Río and Graciosa island. There is not much to do along this coastline except sunbathe and windsurf, but as the currents can be dangerous here, be sure to take care.<n>Teguise is a fine old town of cobbled streets and gracious mansions and was the island capital until 1852. Now it is calm and quiet for six days of the week. On Sundays a handicrafts market comes to town where you can buy a timple — a small ukulele-like instrument used by local folkloric musicians. Several of its old buildings have been converted to craft and antique shops and restaurants. Overlooking the town is the 16th-century Castillo de Santa Bárbara. The views from this wind-blown point are worth the trip alone. High on top of the extinct volcano of Guanapay, the castle now hosts the Museo del Emigrante Canario, where sepia photos and nostalgic exhibits tell the sad story of how mass emigration to South America was the only option left for many Canarian families.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
What to Buy<n>Handicrafts. The Mayan people have always made everything they needed, and their handicrafts, though often practical, make beautiful souvenirs. Basketware made from sisal and other plant species found in the area is typically used to carry a range of goods; woven mats can also be found. Hammocks come in a bewildering range of quality, colors, and sizes; you’ll have your choice of a sencillo (single) or one to share with friends, such as a doble (double) or matrimonial (family-sized).<n>Weaving has also been a very important skill for the Mayans. The fabric produced on personal looms in traditional patterns and colors is used in a variety of different products. Sarapes, cotton or wool blankets, and rugs are popular, but you will also find the material made into jackets and hats.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhatToDo.txt
Entertainment<n>Once the sun goes down, Cancún gears up. There’s no shortage of places to go or things to do, and no need to take a long novel to fill those quiet moments — there just won’t be any. Many people don’t take to their beds until they’ve seen the sun come up. If you choose to stay in Mujeres or Cozumel, things will be a bit more laid back. The diving fraternity tends to enjoy low-key, less glamorous entertainment and relatively early nights before they head under the waves early the following day.<n>Before you head straight into the resort atmosphere of Cancún, check out what’s happening in your hotel. Many have “Las Vegas style” floor shows, Mexican evenings with traditional folk music and dances, and clubs where you can take to the dance floor yourself.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhatToDo.txt
Isla Mujeres now has a population of around 15,000. In past centuries, however, it was the haunt of Caribbean pirates, being far from the clutches of colonial overlords in Havana, San Juan in Puerto Rico, and Panama City, the nearest colonial outposts. The earliest recorded visitors arrived in 1517, when Spanish explorer Francisco Hernández de Córdoba landed to discover a number of small temples built for the goddess of fertility Ix chel. It was he who named the island. Mujeres is only 8 km (5 miles) in length, less than a kilometer (1⁄2 mile) at its widest point, and split by inland lakes and bays. One main road forms an ellipse, following the shape of the coastline.<n>Most ferries deposit you at the very northern tip of the island, on the main pier of the only town on Mujeres. Craft shops and bars crowd onto the sidewalks and sandy streets. The place bustles, especially when the ferries arrive. As afternoon turns to evening and the day-trippers head back to Cancún, Isla Mujeres takes on a much quieter character. The island has many loyal fans that return year after year for its particular atmosphere. Many who choose to stay come for the diving, which usually means low-key entertainment and early nights.<n>A few minutes’ walk north of town is the main beach, Playa Norte, also known as Coco Beach. It has sheltered waters and fine sand, particularly suitable for children. Coconut palms provide shade and a few pelicans fly overhead in search of a meal.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
One of the highlights of the site presents itself immediately as you enter. The magnificent Pirámide del Advino (Pyramid of the Magician, also called the Pyramid of the Dwarf) sits atop five older structures. This pyramid is unique for a number of reasons. It has rounded sides, giving it a softened shape. It’s steep (even more precipitous than the normal elevations in the area), and the design of the doorway at the top, which is a huge representation of Chaac, is found at no other site. The façade of the upper levels is extremely ornate and the main staircase has a parallel row of large Chaac masks. It is closed to tourists at present, as work continues on exploring the inner chambers, but it is possible to study the whole façade from the courtyard in front of the pyramid.<n>Next to the pyramid is the Cuadrángulo de las Monjas (Quadrangle of the Nuns), given its name in the 16th century because it resembled a Spanish monastery or nunnery. Its size — over 70 rooms — has caused archaeologists to postulate that it may have been a military academy, which expanded regularly throughout its history. The western building has the most richly carved façade. There are also numerous depictions of Mayan homes or nah, which have changed little since classical times and can still be found all across the countryside of Yucatán. The eastern building has a statue of a dwarf dressed in a turtle shell placed in a position normally associated with the rulers of Mayan cities. A serpent is entwined all along the upper façade around the statue. From its upper levels the many buildings at the site come clearly into view. The quadrangle is the setting for the Uxmal Light and Sound Show, which takes place every evening.<n>South of the quadrangle, beyond a small ball court, the land rises to a higher level. Here another group of buildings forms the main center of focus at the site. The Casa de las Tortugas (Turtle House), so called because of numerous turtle motifs adorning it, is found immediately on the right. Beside, and totally dwarfing it, lies the Palacio del Gobernador (Governor’s Palace) with an imposing 100-m- (320-ft-) long façade. The building was erected in the 11th century for the ruler of the city, Halach Huinic (the true man), and consists of a central building flanked by two smaller wings. The frieze of Chaac masks is one of the most ornate and complex in the known Mayan world.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
What to Do<n>Most visitors to China come to see the nation’s many excellent historic and cultural sites, including the imperial treasures. But there is much else of interest in this vast land to make the journey truly enjoyable. You will of course want to bring home at least a few souvenirs, and you will have opportunities to attend presentations of an incredible range of performing arts. It will not be difficult to fill your moments of leisure with memorable activities that will make your trip last well after you return home.<n>Shopping<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhatToDo.txt
Ethnic novelties. Artisans from China’s ethnic minority groups produce a good share of exotica: ornaments and figurines, ceremonial knives and swords, skullcaps and other headgear, colorful dresses and shirts, and shaggy sheepskin coats.<n>Fans. One factory in Hangzhou alone manufactures 10 million fans per year, most of them for export. They come in several hundred varieties, but the best known folding fans are made of fragrant sandalwood or black paper.<n>Figurines. Ceramic polychrome figurines of historic or legendary personages are popular, as are little animals, with the panda the most sought after.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhatToDo.txt
Seals. These ink stamps (also called “chops”) are the traditional Chinese substitute for handwritten signatures. You can have one carved just for you, with your name incised — perhaps in ancient Chinese block characters — in soapstone, plastic, jade, or ivory.<n>Souvenirs. In any local department store or street market you’re likely to come across some very Chinese inspirations: acupuncture charts and dolls, those ubiquitous thermos flasks, tea mugs with lids, padded jackets, posters, and so on.<n>Tea. A collection of Chinese teas (black, green, semi-fermented, and flower-petal) makes an inexpensive, useful, and long-lasting souvenir. Tea is frequently packaged in special, artistically decorated containers.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhatToDo.txt
Tiantan Park, known to foreigners as Temple of Heaven Park, is the biggest of Beijing’s parks, celebrated for its assembly of thrilling 15th-century architecture. The highlight is the circular, blue tile-roofed Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest (Qiniandian). This marvel of geometry, art, and engineering, built without a single nail, measures 371⁄2 m (123 ft) to the gilded orb on its topmost roof. In 1889 the masterpiece was struck by lightning and burned almost to the ground. Fortunately, the ruin was quickly restored to its original, resplendent state.<n>The emperor was carried here in a procession in the first lunar month of each year to pray for a bountiful harvest. The floor plan of the hall provides the key to the building’s function. The four central columns represent the seasons; then come two concentric rings of 12 columns each, representing the months and the dozen two-hour periods into which the day was divided; and 28 hardwood pillars symbolize the constellations.<n>Although tourists can no longer enter this monument, its colorful interiors can still be glimpsed from outside. Other attractions at the park include the Round Altar (Haunqiutan) and Echo Wall, where whispered secrets ricochet and are mysteriously magnified, crossing an immense courtyard, without benefit of modern technology.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
The first elements of the wall system were built more than 2,000 years ago, but the expansion and consolidation of the project near Beijing began under the Ming Dynasty in the 14th century. The serpentine stone bulwark and elevated highway became Wanlichangcheng — “The Wall Ten Thousand Li Long” (about 6,000 km/3,700 miles).<n>The restored section of the wall at Badaling, undulating up the unexpectedly steep hillsides, can be a test of a tourist’s endurance. It is far steeper and more formidable than it looks in any tourist brochure. Out of breath, many visitors exchange sympathetic smiles along the way as they ascend to one or another of the towers. If you walk far enough west, you come upon unrestored sections of the wall at the edge of the Gobi Desert.<n>The Badaling section is often overcrowded these days. Two other sections now provide relatively easy access to tourists: the Great Wall at Mutianyu, as beautiful as the section at Badaling but a little less steep, and the Great Wall at Simatai, more distant from Beijing than other sections but virtually unrestored. Simatai is the least crowded and most original of the Great Wall sites. Although it too has a cable-car concession, Simatai bills itself as “the most dangerous section of the Great Wall.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
The capital of Hunan Province, Changsha lies along the Xiang River, a wide and often turbulent stream that flows into the Yangzi. The long thin strip of Orange Island (Juzizhou), rich in oranges among other crops, bisects the river and in the early 20th century was home to a small band of Western traders and missionaries. From the pavilion at the southern tip there is an engrossing view of sampans, barge trains, and passenger ships. On the far side of the river, fragrant forests climb the slopes of Yuelu Hill, a favorite escape from the subtropical heat of the city in summer. One of the evergreen trees in the mountainside Lushan Temple is more than 1,700 years old. The Qing Dynasty pavilion on top (Yunlugong) affords a fine panorama.<n>For most tourists the prime attraction of the region is found in the northeast part of town: the Hunan Provincial Museum, with its renowned relics of the Han Dynasty, including silks, ceramics, and lacquerware of unbelievable sophistication, as well as alluring figurines and musical instruments. All these artifacts survived because they were buried in coffins within coffins in subterranean royal tombs. These beautiful wooden boxes come from the royal graves at Mawangdui, as does the museum’s show-stopper: the remarkably well-preserved silk-wrapped mummy of the Marquis of Dai’s wife, Tohou, who died at age 50 in 186 b.c. Nearly 2,200 years later, her hair is still on her head and her expression is unchanged from the moment of her last breath.<n>Tourists in Changsha are sometimes taken to visit the local embroidery factory, where Hunan’s handicraft tradition has flourished for 2,000 years. Staff artists paint original designs, usually of landscapes, animals, birds, or flowers, which the artisans reproduce stitch by microscopic stitch in colorful silk. The workers here are proudest of the double-faced embroidery, with a different picture on each side.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Dunhuang (Tunhuang)<n>It used to take 24 hours by train, plus a cruel two- or three-hour bus or jeep journey, to reach the sleepy desert town of Dunhuang, in Gansu province. Now it’s an easy airplane ride from Xi’an. Dunhuang has come a long way since the days when the Silk Road camel trains stopped here. Camels still work in and around Dunhuang, pulling plows or transporting cargo. If you’ve just come from overpopulated eastern China, you might feel all but alone in a town of only 10,000. Although some donkey carts and bicycles occasionally impinge on the tranquillity of the main street, the townsfolk have plenty of time to stand around and gossip.<n>In China even provincial museums can be treasure troves. The Dunhuang County Museum, in the center of the town, overflows with Silk Road relics, from works of art to 2,000-year-old chopsticks. The first hall is devoted to calligraphic rarities found in Cave No. 17 of the Mogao Grottoes. Paper documents have survived for a thousand years in the dry climate of the cave. In the second room, sacrificial objects unearthed in ancient tombs are shown alongside pots, a plow, and armor. Ancient handicrafts displayed in the third hall include a Tang Dynasty chess set, a present from the governor to the emperor.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Mogao Caves<n>In spite of the difficulties, tourists still head for this 2,000-year-old town to see China’s most magnificent ancient murals and painted statues. Since you’ve come this far, they’re worth another 25 km (15 miles).<n>The Mogao Caves, hewn from a desert cliffside, tell the story of the great flowering of Buddhist art in China. Begun in the fourth century, they were created in fits and starts over the next thousand years. Statistics aren’t everything, but consider that there are 45,000 sq m (484,000 sq ft) of mural paintings. They cover the walls and ceilings with brightly colored pictures of men and gods and speculations about eternity. And in the same caves stand more than 2,000 painted sculptures, realistic or fantastic. Of the several hundred grottoes still intact, only a few dozen are open to the public. And even these are kept locked so that visits can be supervised. The outer walls of the caves have been reinforced, with walkways added. Tours cover various itineraries. Here are some highlights:<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
The capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot is a sprawling, booming city with a metropolitan population of more than one million. The center of town looks to the future with new official buildings, housing blocks, and wide avenues, but the traffic evokes nostalgia with its parade of donkey carts, ox carts, pony carts, and farm tractors, plus the usual proliferation of bicycles.<n>It might come as a surprise that Mongolians are only a small minority here. Most of the residents of Hohhot are Han (ethnic Chinese), and Inner Mongolia’s close connection with China dates back several centuries. For tourists in search of the exotic, though, Hohhot and vicinity offer many opportunities to make contact with Mongolian traditions. You can drink butter tea with millet and sleep in a yurt, a felt-covered circular tent.<n>A quite unexpected feature of Hohhot is its modern racecourse. Under the sky-blue domes of the reviewing stand, visitors are often treated to a Mongolian “rodeo” of racing and trick riding and perhaps a procession of two-humped camels. Another lively spot is Xinhua Square, where half the town seems to exercise and play before work, returning each evening to sample the kebabs and other Muslim fare from dozens of food stalls. Along nearby streets peddlers shout out their wares with equal enthusiasm, whether they’re selling shirts, vegetables, or sunglasses. Cobblers work hand-cranked sewing machines in the open air. A bard, banging a cymbal, chants a story, while his partner — a trained monkey — dons the masks and hats of various Chinese opera characters, mesmerizing the crowd.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Many of the formations resemble particular animals, plants, buildings, and characters out of Chinese classics. You will find one pinnacle in the image of an “Elephant on a Stone Terrace” and another like a “Rhinoceros Looking at the Moon.” At one point in the maze you must squeeze through the Narrowest Pass; doing so, according to Sani legend, adds ten years to your life. From Peak Viewing Pavilion, the highest point in the Stone Forest, there’s a comprehensive view of this great thicket of jagged rocks thrusting skyward.<n>The biggest open space in the Stone Forest, a lawn surrounded by cherry trees, is the site of a Sani festival each June. For 48 continuous hours, the tribesmen devote themselves to singing and dancing, wrestling matches, bullfights (actually, water buffalo fighting each other), feasting, and romancing. Many of the celebrants come from Five Tree Village (Wukeshu), across Shilin Lake from the hotel. This community of several thousand Sani residents shelters water buffalo, pigs, goats, and dogs. The Sani themselves live in thatched-roof, mud-and-wattle houses.<n>Those who stay the night in the Stone Forest are usually entertained with a Sani folklore show. Among the instruments in the orchestra are flutes, zithers, and a giant banjo with a hollow bottom. Women dancers wear red, white, and black conical hats, while the men sport floppy black turbans. Through song and mime they recount the legends that link their people to the otherworldly presence of the Stone Forest.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Around Nanjing<n>Chinese pilgrims of all political persuasions come from many countries to honor the founder of the Chinese Republic at the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshanling), in the Purple Hills east of Nanjing. The hillside complex roofed with blue tiles, completed in 1929, could scarcely be more grandiose. Following a long winding avenue planted with plane trees, you continue up the 392 granite steps of the ceremonial staircase to the actual memorial hall. There are statues of Dr. Sun standing, sitting (by a French sculptor, Paul Landowski), and recumbent above the vault itself. On the ceiling is a mosaic version of the Nationalist (Guomindang) flag, a white star on a blue background. Dr. Sun often roamed these hills during his Nanjing years. It was his own wish that he be buried here, although he could never have anticipated the imperial splendor that developed.<n>Nearby in the Purple Hills is Mingxiaoling, the tomb of Emperor Hong Wu, founder of the Ming Dynasty. What with wars and revolutions, there is not much left of the 14th-century complex. But don’t miss the Sacred Way, lined with large stone statues of elephants, camels, horses, lions, and mythical animals, which turns north into an approach road guarded by statues of generals and mandarins. In the hall above the burial site are displayed pictures of the emperor. Guides report he was even uglier in real life; two court artists are said to have lost their heads for an excess of realism in their portraits.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Guitars, the rhythm of castanets and drumming heels, and taut, anguished songs — that’s flamenco. You’ll be left breathless by these songs and dances from Andalusia.<n>There are two distinct forms of flamenco: the cante jondo (deep song) is an outpouring of intense, soul-searching emotions. The agonized songs, heavy with the wail of Arabia, come from deep within the singer, while the dances are formal and sombre. Cante jondo is seldom heard outside Andalusia and Madrid, except on recordings.<n>Not so the cante chico (light song), a more animated version performed in tablaos (floor shows) on the Costa Blanca. With a little luck, you may even see flamenco performed by a top Spanish dance company touring on behalf of the Ministry of Information and Tourism’s Festivales de España. Although the songs may express something of the cante jondo’s desolation, the dancing is very different. The fandango, tango, farruca, and zambra are performed to the staccato rhythm of palmadas (hand-clapping), pitos (finger-snapping), the zapateado of fiercely drumming heels, and the fiery compulsion of the castanets.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Eating Out<n>Far more interesting than the so-called international cuisine, the hearty local dishes are worth seeking out: ingredients come fresh from the sea or the farm and are served with a wide choice of the region’s excellent vegetables. Most tourist hotels and restaurants specialize in caution, with menus guaranteed to cause neither rapture nor complaints. Ask around and find out where Spaniards and resident expatriates eat.<n>Soups and Stews<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Tour operators offer any number of excursions, some more esoteric than others, with brochures and booking facilities available through your hotel or a local travel agent. Another form of organized entertainment, amusement parks, are discussed below in the section for families with young children.<n>Bullfights: Andalucía is famed for its bullfighting traditions, and has two, Sevilla and Córdoba, of the seven first-class Plaza de Toros (bullrings) in Spain. The provincial capitals of Almería, Granada, Huelva, Jaén, and Málaga as well as Algeciras and El Puerto de Santa María are second-class rings. All others, including those of the resort towns along the Costa del Sol, come into the third class category. The two main events are a Corrida de Toros, where fully qualified matadors fight fully-grown — at least 4 year old — toros (bulls), and Novilladas, where novilleros (novice matadors) fight novillos (immature bulls).<n>As a rule of thumb, the better events are held in the better plazas, particularly during the ferías (holiday fairs) held in the major cities. Equally true is the fact that most of the events held in the resort towns are mainly for the benefit of tourists, and are of lesser quality. They are not generally less expensive, though; small rings mean fewer seats, which often equates to higher prices. Contrary to popular opinion, bullfights are not held every Sunday in each city. In fact, outside of the ferías — when they are held daily — only Sevilla has them on a regular basis throughout the season. In other places, with the exception of Easter Sunday and August 15 — important national holidays — they are held sporadically and advertised by way of the ubiquitous carteles (posters) stuck on every wall. Be warned, though, these events are never less than bloody — and can be much worse. They are, however, enthralling spectacles, and whatever your reaction, you’ll gain a valuable insight into the country and the people.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhatToDo.txt
But Marbella has its historic side, too. In fact, its history dates back some 1,600 years, even though most of what can be seen, in the town at least, dates from the time of the Catholic Monarchs and later. North of the main road, the Casco Antiguo (Old Town) provides an intriguing glimpse of the past that has been cleverly integrated to cater to modern visitors. First, sit at a café table in the Plaza de los Naranjos (Square of the Orange Trees), where you can admire the noble 16th-century façade of the Casa Consistorial (Town Hall) and soak up the atmosphere. Then wander through the maze of narrow, twisting streets where the whitewashed walls are decorated with colorful baskets of flowers.<n>As you explore the neighborhood, you’ll come across the historic parish church with its landmark bell tower, and the convents of La Trinidad and San Francisco (it is said that Miguel de Cervantes, creator of the famous Don Quixote, lodged at the latter). Uphill from the church lie the crumbling walls of the Moorish castillo. Scattered throughout this area also are an eclectic array of shops and galleries.<n>Other places of interest in Marbella are the Bonsai Museum, the only one in Spain and one of the best in the world, and the Museum of Spanish Contemporary Engravings. Housed in a structure important in its own right, the latter is the first of its kind in Spain and has works by Picasso, Miró, Tapies, and other such famous artists.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Also at sea level is the Gibraltar Museum, housed in a building containing what are considered the best preserved Moorish baths in Europe. The museum has interesting exhibits on Gibraltar’s history. Of interest, too, is Nelson’s Anchorage, where Admiral Nelson’s body is said to have been brought in a barrel of rum after the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, and the nearby 100-ton Victorian super-gun, the largest gun of its type in the world.<n>Main Street ends at the Referendum Gates. Beyond lies the cable-car station, where you can take a trip to the top of the Rock with a stop halfway to visit the Apes’ Den. The tail-less Barbary apes that inhabit the Rock are natives of North Africa, descended from monkeys brought over by sailors as pets and ships’ mascots. Legend has it that if the apes ever leave the Rock, then British rule will come to an end. When the apes’ population declined significantly during World War II, Winston Churchill himself was worried, and the monkeys have been on special rations ever since. The views from the summit 426 m (396 ft) up are spectacular, particularly across the strait to Morocco, along the coast toward Estepona, and down the sheer east face of the Rock to the water holding areas (for desalination) and the beaches of Sandy Bay, Catalan Bay, and Eastern Beach.<n>Whether you’re traveling in your own car or in an official taxi or minivan, don’t leave Gibraltar without taking a tour of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve area. On the way up note the yellow patches and their accompanying metal rings; these were used when manually hauling the heavy cannons up the Rock. Also of interest is the fact that there is no soil on the Upper Rock; the 600 species of wildflower here grow directly out of the limestone from which the Rock is formed.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Along the road from Almuñécar, pretty villas with spectacular coastal views dot the hillsides until, all of a sudden, the scenery changes dramatically. As the coast flattens out, a town of whitewashed houses atop a rocky, cone-shaped hill comes into view. Called Salobreña, it makes for an impressive sight. A Moorish castle, beautifully restored, stands isolated at the heart of the village.<n>Salobreña stands as the gateway to the agriculturally rich vega (plain) of the thriving port city of Motril. Sugarcane, the source of the greenery, flourishes here. The sugar refineries in the area have earned the town its nickname — Little Cuba. Like that country, Motril is known for its rum, although its residents are crafty enough to make just about enough for local consumption, and no more. Motril and Salobreña have their own extensive beaches and there are many more to come as the road continues eastward.<n>The next 40 km (25 miles) is a conservation area and the least developed of any section of the Costa del Sol. The small towns and villages, reminiscent of what the rest of the coastline used to be like before the mass tourist invasion, have a very limited supply of hotels, which means that even in midsummer, the beaches are far from overcrowded. What’s more, it’s possible to be swimming in the Mediterranean while the snow-covered peaks of the Sierra Nevada shimmer in the distance.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Costa-WhereToGo.txt
Pottery and Ceramics<n>It’s not surprising, given the importance of ceramics and pottery throughout Crete’s history, that it is still a significant industry. Pieces come as small as a ring holder or olive bowl to huge garden pieces that would have to be shipped back home. Both unglazed and ceramic styles are available; most notable of these is the bright blue glaze of Chaniá ceramics. Traditional designs abound, including marine themes, Minoan designs, and Classical Greek imagery. Modern free-form pieces can also be found, particularly in Chaniá where there are galleries stocked by avant-garde potters. At Margerítes you can watch the potters at work and buy from their workshops.<n>Children’s Crete<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhatToDo.txt
Inland from Ágios Nikólaos are three attractions that make an enjoyable morning or afternoon sightseeing. Head out towards the village of Kritsá 12 km (7 miles) from town. Before you reach the village itself you’ll find a beautiful Byzantine chapel on your right. Panagía Kerá was built in the 13th century and decorated with superb frescoes of the 14th and 15th centuries. You’ll need time to take in every detail of the interior and the simple lines of the exterior.<n>Resume your journey toward Kritsá, but don’t visit the village yet. Follow signs to Lató, the remains of a Dorian city (7th–3rd centuries b.c.) scattered around two scrub-covered hilltops to the north. The blocks of strong stone don’t come close to rivaling the fine fresco-covered walls of Minoan settlements, yet there is a satisfaction in both location and form when you climb among the remains of Lató. There are also wonderful views down to the coast from here.<n>Finally you can allow yourself to head into Kritsá, perhaps to take some well-earned refreshment. This ‘traditional’ village is perhaps overly touristy for some but it is still very much lived-in and extremely well-kept, with brilliant whitewashed walls accented by brightly painted windowframes and charming potted plants. You’ll find good tavernas around the old village square — look for the huge plane tree. Always famed for its carpet weaving and textiles, you’ll see examples hanging from walls and shop doorways in the narrow streets. There is a full range of Cretan handicrafts and traditional foodstuffs to choose from, making Kritsá a good place to do your souvenir shopping.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
The monastery has many treasures within its church —  Panagiá Akrotirianí — and museum. Sixty-one scenes from the Greek prayer Lord, Thou Art Great by renowned icon painter Ioánnis Kornáros (1770) are among the highlights, along with jewel-encrusted vestments and reliquaries of precious metals. You can visit the simple monks’ cells on the first floor and explore the old flour mill which once brought income to the order. Today the farmland owned by the monastery produces organic olive oil considered some of the best on Crete. You can buy it at the small gift shop along with icons and religious books.<n>Northeast of Toploú is one of Crete’s natural wonders. Amid this arid landscape an oasis of verdant palms come into view and beyond a swathe of white sand ringing azure waters. This is Váï; definitely beautiful and very popular at the height of the season. The palms are said to have grown from stone spat out by Arab pirates during the first millennium, but today’s crops are not edible.<n>South of Toploú the road sweeps on to the modern village of Palékastro and its nearby ancient site of the same name, then doglegs south to Zákros where you can leave the car and hike to the coast down one of the most dramatic gorges in the east, the Valley of the Dead. The trek takes around 5 hours and finishes at the village of Kato Zákros on the coast. Here you’ll find several tavernas on the water’s edge and a flock of sea geese eager to sample your leftovers.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Walking right from the museum and right again along the waterfront brings you to the enchanting Venetian inner harbor, now a haven for small fishing craft and tour boats. At the end of the stone jetty is a lighthouse erected during Turkish rule and the harbor cafés were where Ottomans used to socialize over dark thick coffee and communal narghiles (bubble pipes). Today you can spend time over a drink or excellent fish dinner.<n>The maze of narrow streets behind the old harbor forms the core of the old town. Most are pedestrian-only, inviting you to take an exploratory stroll. At every turn there is something to see; most obvious will be the wealth of shopping opportunities at eye level. Craft and jewelry stores create tempting displays, and cotton clothing is swathed across every wall. But don’t neglect to look behind the wares to see Venetian stone lintels above, or to catch site of ornate Ottoman balconies and pretty wooden window frames dressed with bougainvillaea or honeysuckle. At night the streets here come alive with shoppers and revelers, and there are excellent restaurants in some of the old buildings.<n>If you exit the harbor from the southwest you can cross busy Odós Arkadíou to traffic-free Odós Petiháki. On your left is the Venetian Loggia built in 1600. Until recently it was sadly neglected but it has risen like a phoenix from the ashes and now performs the role of an up-market gallery where you can buy excellent copies of museum pieces. Walk down Petiháki to find the Rimondi Fountain. Built in the 1620s its once fine carvings have taken on an aged patina and it looks strangely out of place among the bright Internet cafés now replacing traditional tavernas in this bustling square.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Continue now to the town of Villena, the farthest point from Alicante (64 km/39 miles away) on this tour. The castle here, noted for its double walls and high, eight-turreted tower rarely found south of Madrid, also has national monument status. Villena’s castle was originally built by Moors, though considerable additions were made in the 15th century. The town’s priceless Bronze Age treasure, discovered in a clay jar in the riverbed, is exhibited in the Ayuntamiento (Town Hall). The gold jewellery and objects attest to the artistry of Villena’s early inhabitants.<n>Swing south from Villena along the N-330 to Sax, site of the Roman town of Saxum. The towers of the original Roman castle, which has been fully restored, are still a look-out point. Back on the N-330 you soon come to Petrel’s Moorish castle, reputed to have fabulous treasure buried in its grounds.<n>Unrestored medieval fortresses are found along the C-3212 road to Elda, and beyond, at Monóvar. Elda itself is noted for excellent wine and lace-making. The town was the birthplace of the famous writer, José Martínez Ruiz, better known as Azorín. From Elda, follow the signs to Novelda to find yet another Moorish castle set high on a hill. This one is the Castillo de la Mola, erected on the site of a Roman fort. It has an unusual triangular tower dating from the 13th century. Right next to it you’ll see a strange structure reminiscent of Gaudí’s still unfinished Templo de la Sagrada Familia in Barcelona.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
Benidorm<n>With twin, crescent-moon beaches, 7 km (4 miles) of golden sands, and an outstanding climate, Benidorm is one of Spain’s most popular resorts. But it wasn’t always so. Despite efforts over a hundred years ago by a local entrepreneur, who hoped to bring holiday-makers to the area by a regular stage coach service, large-scale tourism didn’t come to Benidorm until the early 1960s. Since then, a mass of apartment blocks and hotels has sprung up and the town has become known as an international fun city. Some 250,000 people pack into the place in summer.<n>Love it or hate it, Benidorm is thoroughly cosmopolitan: Restaurants here serve bacon and eggs, sauerkraut, smorgasbord, and “tea like mother makes it.” There are bars, cocktail lounges, ritzy restaurants, modern hotels, and a vast choice of discotheques and nightclubs. This makes for a happy, human, unending noise that contradicts those who say the town’s name derives from the valenciano words for “sleep well.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
The Vinalopó River, spanned by a bridge here, supplies the water that is still carried to the horts in canals dug by the Moors.<n>A short distance from the palace toward the city centre, you come upon the Ayuntamiento (Town Hall), with its fine Renaissance façade and Gothic door. Stand back for a good look at the 14th-century Torre del Concejo, a former watchtower. The quaint carved figures of Calendura and Calendureta ring the hours and quarter hours, as they have done since 1759.<n>Crevillente<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
Before you leave the sanctuary, visit the Capilla Mayor (Main Chapel). The strangest of the cathedral’s treasures is contained in an urn here — the heart of Alfonso the Wise, bequeathed to Murcia by the 13th-century king long before his death.<n>Go out of the cathedral on the north side and walk across Plaza Hernandez Amores to the cool and classy Calle de la Trapería (Street of Secondhand Merchants). But don’t look for bargains here; the name of this pedestrian thoroughfare belies the elegance of its shops. At the north end you come upon the Casino (a private club, not a gambling establishment), with spirited turn-of-the century decor. The entrance hall, an exact copy of the Hall of Ambassadors in Seville’s Alcázar, and the ladies’ lavatory — with its ceiling of cherubs — are the most magnificent rooms. (Don’t forget a small tip to the steward who shows you around.)<n>During the Casino’s heyday, the pedestrian Calle de la Platería (Street of Silversmiths), at right angles to the Trapería, was full of practising craftsmen. Flower stalls in the Plaza de las Flores are open every morning. After 11:00 a.m., vendors tend to retreat into nearby shops and bars, particularly in hot weather.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
Cuba has a reputation as a place where there’s little worth buying. You will see incredibly barren peso shops — window displays with bottles of cooking oil, shoe polish, and a few plumbing parts. But there are plenty of things for dollar-wielding visitors to buy now that private enterprise is permitted on a limited scale. Tops on most people’s lists are Cuba’s greatest achievements (not including the national health care system): cigars, rum, and music. There is also an excellent selection of handicrafts available at excellent prices in towns and resorts frequented by tourists. Tourist markets are now thriving in Cuba’s major centers, even if much of what you’ll find is related to Che Guevara — berets, T-shirts bearing his countenance, and dolls, among many other “revolutionary” items.<n>As for essentials, hotel and dollar shops carry mineral water, soap, shampoo, and toothpaste, but many medicinal or cosmetic staples are hard to come by; it’s still best to bring all you need from home. Tiendas Panamericanas are well stocked dollar stores, but probably the most impressive dollar store in all Cuba is the Harris Bros. Company, a multistory (it’s got an escalator!) enterprise near the landmark Art Deco Bacardí building and the capitol.<n>Cuban cities are now an uneasy mix of sad peso stores and bright dollar shops, with an influx of goods most Cubans can only dream about (indeed, you’ll see large crowds of people peering dreamily into shop windows). The uneven divide between communist ideals and materialist longings is one of the great contradictions in contemporary Cuba. Browsing along shopping streets proves endlessly fascinating, though, and provides profound insights into Cuba’s arcane economy.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhatToDo.txt
The streets of Havana are a living museum of chrome-finned wondercars imported during Detroit’s heyday, but several that once belonged to pivotal Cuban figures — among them a 1918 Ford truck used by Fidel’s father and Che’s 1960 Chevrolet Bel Air — are lined up in the Museo de Autos Antiguos (Calle Oficios, 13).<n>Continuing west along Calle Oficios, you’ll come to a splendidly restored square, Plaza de San Francisco, with upscale shops, restaurants, and the imposing 18th-century Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco de Asís. The convent contains a museum with Spanish treasures, and you can climb the belltower for spectacular views of Old Havana. Concerts are frequently held here. Nearby, you’ll find several impeccable colonial-era houses with brilliantly colored façades.<n>Plaza Vieja<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
In the same year, the government acquired the Museo de Artes Decorativas, at Calle 17 between Calles D and E. Each room in this grand 19th-century villa is furnished in a particular style: English Chippendale, Chinese, baroque, or Art Deco in the fabulous bathroom.<n>Vedado’s top sight, though, is the Cementerio de Cristóbal Colón (Columbus Cemetery). Massive marble mausoleums line the principal avenues of the cemetery, a vast city of the dead established in the late 1800s. Cubans come to pray and place flowers at the tomb of La Milagrosa (“The Miracle Worker”), who helps people in need. It is said that she was buried with her infant at her feet, but when their bodies were exhumed, the child was found cradled in her arms.<n>Plaza de la Revolución<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
Cayo Largo and the Isle of Youth<n>The two main islands in the Archipiélago de los Canarreos, south of western Cuba, could not be more different. Cayo Largo is a tourist enclave where visitors are never more than a few yards from sugar-white sands. Yet it’s an antiseptic place, devoid of any Cubans except those who work there. By contrast, the Isle of Youth sees virtually no tourists except those at the rather isolated Hotel El Colony (on the small island’s southwestern tip), who come exclusively for the superb diving at a nearby beach.<n>Cayo Largo, an island 25 km (15.5 miles) long and the most easterly of the Archipiélago de los Canarreos, might be your Caribbean paradise — if all you’re looking for is a dazzling white beach and clear blue seas. Other than the miles of beaches, there’s not much else of consequence here except mangrove, scrub, and half a dozen comfortable hotels with a full program of entertainment and watersports. Turtles nest in the sand at one end of the island. At the other you can go sailing, diving, or deep-sea fishing or take a boat trip to Playa Sirena, an incomparable strip of sand a 10-minute boat ride away, where lobster lunches are available. Cayo Largo, with its captive tourist audience, is considerably more expensive than the mainland.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
The Zapata Peninsula is the largest wetlands area in the Caribbean, flat as a pancake and covered in mangrove swamps and grassland plains. Its protected wildlife includes crocodiles, manatees, and numerous species of birds. Frankly, though, you are unlikely to see any interesting wildlife unless you take a guided bird-watching trip from Playa Larga. You can see penned reptiles at the crocodile farm at La Boca, a popular tourist site where you can pose with a baby croc and taste crocodile steak.<n>A more appealing prospect is picturesque Guamá, a half-hour boat ride from La Boca along an artificial channel and then across the vast Laguna del Tesoro (Treasure Lake). Legend has it that the Indians dumped their jewels into the water rather than surrender them to Spanish conquistadores. Guamá is a group of tiny islands connected by wooden bridges. A few visitors stay in the thatched cabañas (see page 131), but most just come to wander along the boardwalk, greet the ducks and egrets, and have a meal.<n>The peninsula is best known, however, for its bloody role in clandestine political warfare. South of La Boca you soon come to Playa Girón — site of the 1961 US-led Bay of Pigs invasion (see page 19). At irregular intervals along the often crab-infested road are concrete memorials to those who died during the invasion. There are two simple, isolated bungalow hotel complexes on the bay, one at quiet Playa Larga, the other at Playa Girón, where the already scruffy beach is further spoiled by a concrete breakwater. One major attraction, however, is the excellent Museo Playa Girón, which serves as an emotional memorial to the three-day Bay of Pigs debacle.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt

The Licchavi dynasty, of high-caste Hindu origin, ruled in the Kathmandu Valley from about a.d. 330 to 700. King Manadeva I (a.d. 462–505) shook off the domination of the India Gupta emperors and extended his kingdom from the Kosi River in the east to the Gandaki River in the west and from the Terai to the Himalayan passes. A great king of this line, Amsuvarna (609–621), married his daughter Bhrikuti to the ruler of Tibet, Srongtsen Gampo. In 640, Bhrikuti and her Chinese co-wife converted Srongtsen Gampo to Buddhism. Bhrikuti is venerated as the “Green Tara” and the Chinese wife as the “White Tara.” Their images are prominent in Nepalese Buddhist art. Commercial and cultural links with Tibet, and through Tibet with China, were strengthened at this time.<n>More reliable records come with the next major dynasty, the Malla, who were established in about 1200 by the strongman Ari Malla. The Malla came to Nepal in the first of several waves of Hindu fugitives from the 11th-century Muslim invasion of northern India. Many of the refugees were nobles of the Chetri warrior caste from Rajasthan; forging new feudal states in Nepal, they were responsible for reinforcing Hinduism at the expense of Buddhism. The Kathmandu Valley itself was raided in 1336 by the Muslim Sultan of Bengal. In seven days he destroyed both Hindu and Buddhist temples and statues, including Swayambhunath and Pashupatinath. These great shrines were later rebuilt and expanded into their present magnificence.<n>The Malla period saw completion of Nepal’s most important palaces, temples, and works of art. But Nepal and the Mallas became fragmented upon the death in 1482 of King Yaksha Malla, who divided his lands amongst his heirs. For the next three centuries Nepal had three city-states side by side in the valley — Kantipur (now known as Kathmandu), Lalitpur (now known as Patan), and Bhaktapur (also sometimes called Bhadgaon), along with their hinterlands.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-History.txt
On the Trail<n>Trekking isn’t mountain climbing, but it also isn’t just a stroll in the park. It’s walking, with lots of uphills and downhills. Almost anyone can go trekking, though a trek is definitely more enjoyable if you’re reasonably fit. Sure there are lots of athletes on the trail who seem to be here merely for the challenge, but you’ll also come across groups of the less physically fit, including school groups from the international school in Kathmandu and organized senior citizens’ treks, going happily along at their own pace.<n>As you hike, whether with a fully loaded backpack or just a light daypack, you can’t help marveling at the burdens that porters carry in their dokos (baskets). Everything not made or grown in the villages has to he packed in on the backs of wiry, barefoot porters, who carry loads of as much as 60 kg (130 pounds). Even more amazing is the fact that these baskets have no shoulder straps but only tump lines (forehead straps). You may notice that going downhill, porters take short steps on the balls of their feet with their knees bent. Do the same and you’ll avoid the common complaint of “trekker’s knee.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
White-Water Rafting<n>For heart-in-the-mouth thrills it is hard to beat white-water rafting on the tumultuous snow-fed rivers of Nepal. Although trekking is still the favored outdoor adventure here, rafting is a close second. Many rafting enthusiasts come specifically to paddle this country’s challenging waters, which roar through some of the world’s deepest gorges. The knowledge that even the best rafters sometimes capsize in these currents keeps the adrenaline flowing as fast as the river.<n>Although there are some easy floats on the lowland rivers, the majority of rafting in Nepal is on Class III through Class V waters, not ideal for neophytes. However, plenty of first-timers do get out on the water during their stay in Nepal. Rafts usually carry six passengers plus two guides, and the typical rafting trip includes nights spent camping on the riverbank, with the rafting crew setting up camp and preparing all the meals. Rafters spend a few hours before lunch riding the rapids and enjoying the spectacular scenery, followed by a leisurely lunch (often with a fire to warm shivering bodies). After lunch, it’s more rapids and scenery before stopping early enough to set up camp.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
There are something like 50 temples and shrines, great and small, in the immediate vicinity of Hanuman Dhoka Palace. The palace, which now serves primarily as a museum, takes its name from the red-cloaked figure of the monkey god Hanuman that stands to the left of the main palace entrance. This stone statue was erected in 1672 and stands atop a squat pillar. The statue’s face is entirely obscured by red paste that is smeared on by worshippers. Tour guides say the red paste is to spare Hanuman the sight of the goings-on — more acrobatic than erotic — carved on the struts of the small Jaganath Temple opposite.<n>When this bit of mythology is related, it immediately sends tour groups trotting across to see what is forbidden to the monkey god. Some say the carvings are there for protection, because the goddess of lightning is a virgin who would not come near anything so shocking. The erotica is probably best explained, however, along with Nepal’s ubiquitous Shiva lingams (phalluses) and the female yoni symbols, as an expression of the creative energy in male-female relations and the pleasure principles of Tantrism.<n>In the palace wall beyond the Hanuman statue and protected by a wooden fence is a poem etched in stone in 15 languages dated 14 January 1664. It is attributed to King Pratap Malla, reputed to be a great linguist.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
At this point, continuing to Thahiti Tole, where there is another small stupa, you can walk north to the main intersection of Thamel, Kathmandu’s lively, fast-spreading center for budget-conscious tourists. Guest houses, restaurants, curio vendors, rug shops, trekking agencies, bicycle and motorcycle rental stands, and bookshops line the way. Some guest houses have pleasant gardens, and most are clean and quite inexpensive, though in recent years more expensive hotels have also opened in this neighborhood. Many low-budget guest houses have bulletin boards where trekkers leave messages for friends or advertise for trekking companions.<n>From Thamel’s center you can return to your starting point by heading right, or east, to a roundabout. Back in the modern part of town you come to the Kaiser Library. This has nothing to do with the German emperors, but was built by Field-Marshal Kaiser (a distortion of the Nepali name Kesar) Shumshere Rana. The tall trees surrounding this building, which also houses part of the Ministry of Education, are the daytime roost of a colony of large fruit bats that trade places at dusk with flocks of crows. Inside the library there are old photos of assorted Ranas, smartly dressed in tweed suits, neckties, and polished boots, posing atop the huge rhinos and tigers they’ve slain.<n>The royal family lives in the modern Narayanhiti Palace across the street, behind flagpoles bearing the world’s only non-rectangular national flag. (Nepal’s is made of two superimposed triangular pennants with sun and moon emblems.) The palace stands at the head of the wide Durbar Marg avenue leading south. Here are airline and travel agency offices, banks, quality shops, restaurants, and leading hotels — the opposite pole of tourism from Thamel. Veer right at the end of Durbar Marg to reach the Rani Pokhari (Queen’s Pond).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
Leaving the square on the lane that begins at the back of the Bhimsen Temple and following the street around to the right will bring you to the Golden Temple, or Kwa Bahal, a Buddhist monastery founded in the 11th century. Two painted lions mark the entrance. Inside, the monastery surrounds a sunken courtyard with an exquisite golden shrine in the center, backed by a pagoda temple decorated with episodes from the life of Buddha. Flanking the steps leading to the courtyard and standing on statues of tortoises are two bronze elephants with praying riders on their backs. On the upturned roof corners of the shimmering golden shrine stand bronze birds.<n>From the Golden Temple, continue descending the narrow lane and you will come to temple complex dominated by a five-tiered pagoda, the Kumbheshwar Temple, which is dedicated to Shiva and dates to 1392. Two ponds in the temple compound are said to be fed by waters from the holy Gosainkund Lake high in the Himalayas. During summer, thousands of devotees come to bathe in these ponds beneath a richly ornamented Shiva lingam.<n>The alleys of Patan lead to a succession of half-hidden temples and shrines of great beauty and interest. One of the most impressive of these is the Mahaboudha, or Temple of the Thousand Buddhas, which was erected in the 16th century. Designed after the temple at Bodh Gaya in India where Buddha reached enlightenment, this soaring spire boasts an image of Buddha on each one of its bricks. Extensively damaged during the 1934 earthquake, it was later reconstructed.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
Bhaktapur (Bhadgaon)<n>Bhaktapur lies 16 km (10 miles) east of the center of Kathmandu. Bhaktapur means “City of Devotees,” and this could today be taken to mean devotion to the old ways, for Bhaktapur is even more medieval than Old Kathmandu or Patan. Exploring its narrow streets, you’ll come upon squares filled with pottery drying in the sun and potters working at their hand-spun wheels, weavers at their looms, and wood-carvers at work on window frames. Artists with the finest of brushes paint the minutely detailed religious paintings called thangkas. These are widely sold, but the best come from Bhaktapur. Newari families also still work the fields that come right to the city’s edge.<n>Bhaktapur’s treasures are many, and if time permits you will be amply rewarded by allowing two half-days to wandering through its alleys.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
From Kathmandu, short trips to the valley rim make it possible for those with limited time to see the high mountains at sunrise or sunset.<n>Nagarkot, which stands on the crest of a ridge at 2,195 m (7,200 ft), is about an hour’s drive from Bhaktapur and one of the best places in the Kathmandu area for viewing the Himalayas. From this aerie on the rim of the Kathmandu Valley, 322 km (200 miles) of the Himalayas stretch out before you in an immense wall of rock and ice. Although there are excellent views from the many lodges and hotels here, the view is even better from a nearby observation tower, which can be reached in about an hour’s walk from Nagarkot. From this observation tower, it is possible to see as far as Mount Everest. Most visitors come for the sunrise or sunset on the mountains, and though the weather is often at its clearest in the early morning, low clouds and fog often obstruct the view.<n>The Kathmandu area’s other popular mountain-viewing spot is the village of Dhulikhel, which has a view very similar to that from Nagarkot and is a bit easier to reach, since it is on the main highway to Tibet. This highway passes through Banepa, where you can turn off to visit Panauti. The buildings here have great artistic and historic importance and for this reason have become the focus of a French-funded restoration project. Today, this out-of-the-way village offers a fascinating glimpse into the Kathmandu Valley’s small-town life. Dhulikhel, on the other hand, is strictly about mountain views. Here there are several attractive hotels, including one with tropical gardens, that cater to visitors hoping to catch a glimpse of the Himalayas at sunrise or sunset. At dawn and dusk, the otherwise perfectly spectacular mountains are made just that much more breathtaking as they are painted in shades of lavender and pink by the rising and setting sun.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
The best way to see the wildlife, and certainly the most fun, is swaying atop a silently padding elephant. The elephant grass along the several rivers in the park is so tall that only from an elephant’s back can you spot rhinos, deer, and other creatures, most of which are used to seeing elephants and do not run from them. With luck, you’ll see a leopard draped indolently on a tree branch, and perhaps a stately sambar stag. In winter, the gaur, the world’s largest wild ox, almost 2 m (6 ft) high at the shoulder, comes out of its hideaway in the Siwalik Hills on the park’s southern edge in search of young grass. Spotted deer, sloth bear, giant flying squirrels, and civet cats are among the other mammals the visitor may see.<n>There are several jungle lodges and tented camps within the park’s boundaries, and from any of these camps there is a very high likelihood that you will see rhinos and deer. Tigers, leopards, and sloth bears are a bit more elusive. All of these lodges, and even some outside the park, have their own elephants and nature guides. On a stay at one of these lodges, a half day is usually spent in dug-out canoes searching for endangered gharials, a narrow jawed fish-eating crocodile, and their flesh-eating cousins, the huge marsh muggers. However, these canoe rides actually focus on the more visible bird life along the river banks — egrets, ducks, storks, kingfishers, eagles, and scores of other fascinating birds. The rare, almost sightless Gangetic dolphin may even come up for a blow alongside your canoe if you are extremely lucky. At day’s end, lodge guests compare notes around the bar. At least one evening during a stay, men from a nearby Tharu village will perform their traditional martial arts-like stick dance.<n>Along the park boundary and especially at Sauraha near park headquarters, dozens of lodges and inexpensive guest houses cater to budget-minded tourists. Elephant rides, jeep tours, and canoe trips can all be arranged at the park entrance, where an interesting interpretive center provides a history of the area and information about its ecology. One is reminded that in 1938, during a safari arranged for the British Viceroy of India, hundreds of elephants took part in a hunt that bagged 120 tigers, 38 rhinos, and 27 leopards.

Travel by road provides a glimpse of the Terai, an extension of the Ganges Plain. This well-watered farming zone stretches the length of the country on its southern border with India. It’s only about 40 km (25 miles) wide, but a third of Nepal’s population lives here, producing much of the nation’s food.<n>A visit to Lumbini, birthplace of Gautama Buddha, can also be made in about three hours from Chitwan. (There are also flights from Kathmandu to Bhairawa, the nearest airfield, with a bus service to Lumbini.) The story goes that Buddha’s mother gave birth to him under a tree in a garden at Lumbini, unable to get back in time to the palace, some 20 km (12 miles) away. Marking the spot is a pillar commemorating the visit in 250 b.c. of the Indian emperor Ashoka, a zealous convert to Buddhism. Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world come to Lumbini, and in recent years the site has been developed into an international cultural and religious park with several hotels and numerous Buddhist temples built by the world’s various Buddhist countries.<n>Although few tourists stray from the Kathmandu-Pokhara-Chitwan focal points, it is possible to see something of the undeveloped west without walking three weeks to get there. There are now several lodges at Royal Bardia National Park on the Karnali River. This park was created specifically as a preserve for tigers, which, with a little luck, can be seen here more easily than at Chitwan National Park. Elephant rides, jungle walks and drives, river rafting, and bird-watching keep visitors busy. The Karnali gorge above Chisopani is especially beautiful and is noted for the size of the fighting mahseer carp taken by sport fishermen.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
The Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1762 brought a shattering blow to the population of Louisiana. Overnight, it appeared, they had been handed over to King Charles III of Spain — though the treaty was not announced until 1764. It all made perfect sense to King Louis XV, cousin of Charles (both were Bourbons), for the French and Indian War, known in Europe as the Seven Years War, had been disastrous for French interests abroad. Britain won Canada and everything east of the Mississippi, including Spanish Florida. To Louis, Louisiana was now isolated in a British-ruled part of the world, a money-losing outpost that seemed to have no future.<n>It must have come as an almost unbearable shock to the patriotic Frenchmen of New Orleans to be told that they were Spanish citizens. Waiting for the first Spanish governor to arrive put a huge strain on the disillusioned society. When Governor Antonio de Ulloa finally sailed up the Mississippi in 1766, four years after the treaty was signed, a crashing storm erupted, as if an omen for the climate ahead. The governor, a scholarly retired naval officer with good intentions, was accompanied by a contingent of 80 Spanish soldiers, most of retirement age.<n>The high-society frolics of the Vaudreuil era were over; the Spanish governor’s wife froze out the Creole ladies of New Orleans from official invitation lists. French-speaking citizens protested the snub with a petition and a demonstration that got out of control and turned into violence. Spain called it treason. The harassed Ulloa could take no more and sailed into exile.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_NewOrleans-History.txt
The cinema is a great national passion, with over 300 different films showing in Paris every week. For undubbed versions with French subtitles, look out for the letters VO (version originale) in listings or posters. Cinemas on the Champs-Elysées, in Montparnasse, St-Germain-des-Prés, Bastille, and the Forum des Halles all show VO movies.<n>Keeping up with the latest in discos and clubs can be a full-time job for professional night-owls: there’s no point in turning up before midnight. Many are nominally private, which means you only get in if the doormen like the way you look. Some expensive, exclusive examples hide out around the Champs-Elysées, such as Régine’s in the rue de Ponthieu. Louder, less expensive, younger, and weirder places come and go around Bastille and Oberkampf. There’s still some life in St-Germain-des-Prés and the Latin Quarter, especially in university term time — making local friends is the best way to find it.<n>Pop and rock concerts are held at the spectacular Zénith in the Parc de la Villette (métro: Porte de Pantin), at Parc-des-Princes (métro: Porte de St-Cloud), and also the Palais Omnisport de Bercy (métro: Bercy). Ticket offices (billeteries) at FNAC or Virgin Megastore, both on the Champs-Elysées, will show what groups are in town.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhatToDo.txt
The French take their jazz seriously, and Paris has many jazz clubs. Hot Brass (La Villette) and The New Morning (rue des Petites-Ecuries) attract big American and European musicians, while Le Dunois (rue Dunois) is an intimate place, cultivating more avant-garde music. The Lionel Hampton club at the Méridien Etoile (Porte Maillot) has a full program of guest performers. The old-established Caveau de la Huchette (rue de la Huchette in St-Germain-des-Prés) opens every night at 9:30pm for listening and dancing to a small combo or big band swing or bebop. Entrance prices of around 60–120F may include your first drink; extra drinks cost 30–60F.<n>In the realm of classical music, Paris has come back into its own, with many fine concerts at Salle Pleyel and Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, opera at the new Opéra-Bastille, and the ballet at the Opéra-Garnier. In all cases, some seats are reasonably priced, though they tend to go quickly. Look out for free concerts in churches.<n>Modern dance is enjoying a revival, with a new wave of small, imaginative companies beginning modestly enough at the Café de la Danse (passage Louis-Philippe) and Théâtre Garnier before reaching the heights of the Théâtre de la Bastille.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhatToDo.txt
The site of the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris has had a religious role for at least 2,000 years. In Roman times a temple to Jupiter stood here; some stone fragments unearthed in 1711 can be seen in the Musée du Moyen Age (see page 55). In the fourth century, the first Christian church, St-Etienne, was built, joined two centuries later by a second church, dedicated to Notre-Dame. Norman raids left both in a sorry state, and Bishop Maurice de Sully decided a cathedral should be built to replace them. Begun in 1163, the main part of Notre-Dame took 167 years to finish. Its transition from Romanesque to Gothic has been called a perfect representation of medieval architecture, an opinion that has ancient and modern dissenters. Cistercian monks protested that such a sumptuous structure was an insult to the godly virtue of poverty, and today, architectural purists still find Notre-Dame a bit “too much.” It was, however, built to inspire awe.<n>Over its long history, the cathedral has witnessed many momentous occasions. In 1239, there was the procession of Louis IX, barefoot, carrying his holy treasure, Jesus’s Crown of Thorns (now in the Sainte-Chapelle); in 1430, it saw the humiliation of Henry VI of England (he was crowned King of France here; see page 15). And in 1594, it was where Henri IV made his cynical conversion to Catholicism, a move that reinforced his hold on the French throne. Napoléon chose it as the setting for crowning himself emperor (upstaging the Pope, who had come to Paris expecting to do it).<n>In modern times, it has been a place for celebrating victory and mourning the passing of France’s leaders. General de Gaulle marked the 1944 Liberation of Paris with a mass here, and in 1970 his death was similarly commemorated. In 1996, a funeral service was held for de Gaulle’s archrival François Mitterrand here.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
Les Halles<n>East of the Palais-Royal, Les Halles was for centuries the site of the capital’s central food markets (now in a more spacious, if less colorful, location at Rungis, near Orly). To widespread regret, Victor Baltard’s great cast-iron and glass pavilions were torn down in the 1970s. Eventually, gardens, children’s playgrounds, and the maze-like, partly below-ground shopping mall, Forum des Halles, transformed the site. Saturdays bring throngs of teenagers from the suburbs to shop, watch films, roller skate, munch fast food, and just hang out. The liveliest meeting place is around the monumental Renaissance Fontaine des Innocents (once part of a cemetery). Bars, restaurants, and late-night brasseries line the adjoining rue Berger and the streets leading off it. Clubs and discos come alive at midnight and stay open to dawn, especially on weekends. Away from the gardens and playgrounds, the quarter has its seedy side: drink and drugs, pickpockets and prostitutes. Rue St-Denis, once primarily a red-light district, is now pedestrianized, but still has its share of sex shops.<n>The remarkable church of St-Eustache dominates the north side of Les Halles. Built from 1532 to 1637, the main structure is late Gothic with a somewhat incongruous but imposing Renaissance colonnade on its western façade. The church is renowned for its choral concerts and recitals on the grand organ designed by Baltard, architect of Les Halles.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
The district to the north of Ile de la Cité and Ile Saint-Louis has bravely withstood the onslaught of modern construction. It provides a remarkably authentic record of the development of the city, from the reign of Henri IV at the end of the 16th century to the advent of the Revolution. Built on reclaimed marshland, as its name suggests, the Marais contains some of Europe’s most elegant Renaissance mansions (hôtels), many of which now serve as museums and libraries. The one major change is the recent influx of trendy boutiques.<n>Take the métro to Rambuteau and start at the corner of the rue des Archives and the rue des Francs-Bourgeois, named after the poor (not bourgeois at all) allowed to live here tax-free in the 14th century. The national archives are stored in an 18th-century mansion, Hôtel de Soubise. Across a vast, horseshoe-shaped courtyard, you come across the exquisite Rococo style of Louis XV’s time in the apartments of the Prince and Princess of Soubise. Up on the first floor is the Musée de l’Histoire de France, with gems such as the only known portrait of Joan of Arc painted in her lifetime and the diary kept by Louis XVI. His entry for 14 July 1789, the day the Bastille was stormed, reads Rien (Nothing).<n>A garden (not always open to the public) connects the Hôtel de Soubise with its twin, Hôtel de Rohan, on the rue Vieille du Temple. Look out for Robert le Lorrain’s fine Les Chevaux d’Apollon over the old stables in the second courtyard, admired as one of France’s most beautiful 18th-century sculptures.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
Musée du Louvre<n>Revamping the Musée du Louvre since the 1980s has made this formidable palace of art far more accessible, in all senses. In 1793, when the leaders of the Revolution declared the palace a national museum, the Louvre held 630 works of art; a recent inventory listed 250,000. Don’t be put off — it’s an exhilarating experience just attempting to come to grips with such vast collections of painting, sculpture, and artifacts from 5000 b.c. to 1848 (from which date the Musée d’Orsay’s French collections continue the story to 1914).<n>The magnificent glass Pyramid designed by American architect I. M. Pei has gained acceptance as a harmonious entrance to this most venerable of French museums. An escalator descends to the reception area, which comprises shops, cafés, and the ticket office. At the information counter, collect a copy of the free handbook with color-coded floor plans. (Admission, too, is free on the first Sunday of every month.)<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
On 13 May 1917, three young shepherds claimed they saw a series of miraculous visions of the Virgin Mary — said to disclose three secrets, or prophecies, to the children — followed by a solar phenomenon witnessed by thousands in October of the same year. (Two of the children died of pneumonia soon after these inexplicable events; the third, Lucia, now in her 90s, has been a cloistered Carmelite nun in Coimbra since 1929 and makes very few public appearances.)<n>The 20th-century neo-Baroque basilica that draws so many of the faithful, said to be twice as big as St. Peter’s in Rome, faces an immense but rather plain square. Pilgrimages are held on the 13th of every month, with the most important observances on that date in May and October. Yet even on an ordinary weekday, scattered believers, some kneeling in penitence, come to Fátima to pay homage to the Virgin Mary.<n>Tomar<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
Back toward Almancil is one of the Algarve’s top attractions. About 16 km (10 miles) west of Faro, a simple white church stands out on a small hill overlooking the thundering highway. A sign simply says “S. Lourenço” — indicating the turn-off to São Lourenço do Matto (Church of St. Lawrence of the Woods). Inside is one of the most extraordinary displays of azulejo design you’ll ever see. Every square inch of the Baroque, 15th-century church — its walls, vaulted ceiling, and cupola — is covered with hand-painted, blue-and-white ceramic tiles. Most date from the early 18th century and depict biblical scenes detailing the life of St. Lawrence. The ensemble is a stunning sight, not to be missed.<n>Loulé, north of Almancil, is a prosperous town known for its leather, lace, and copper goods. Tour groups come from far and wide to shop at the colorful, bustling market. Just below the permanent market halls on the main Praça da República, you’ll find a well-preserved section of the medieval castle walls (which were much damaged by the 1755 earthquake). Also worth visiting are the Igreja Matriz (São Clemente), a 13th-century Gothic church with 18th-century azulejo tiles; the Convento da Graça, with a terrific Manueline portal; and Ermida de Nossa Senhora da Conceição, a small church prized for its Baroque altar and ceramic tiles.<n>In the streets directly below the castle walls, you may well hear the sounds of craftsmen beating copper — from whom you can buy direct. If you are in the Algarve in springtime, don’t miss the Loulé Carnival. The parades, “Battle of Flowers,” and musical celebrations are the best of their kind in the region.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
The Sotavento Coast<n>Heading east from the provincial capital of Faro, the first settlement of any size you will come to is the colorful fishing town of Olhão. Olhão used to be described as the “little white Cubist town of the Algarve,” its architecture likened to that of North African towns. The parish church (which also goes by the name of Nossa Senhora do Rosário) was founded by King Dom Pedro II in 1698. The small chapel at the rear, Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos (Our Lady of the Afflicted), is where women often pray when their fishermen husbands are away at sea.<n>Instead of the red-tiled roofs and filigreed chimneys seen elsewhere in the Algarve, the Olhão skyline comprises flat-topped roofs of terraces called açoeitas. The Olhão fish market is one of the Algarve’s best, especially famous for its mussels and other shellfish.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
For Spain the 19th century was a bitter slide from imperial might to the status of a has-been. By the early 1800s independence movements had overthrown Spanish rule in most of the Western Hemisphere. Madrid’s most important remaining possessions were the island colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico, both of which were chafing under the yoke of colonial rule and the bitter system of slavery. To squash subversive ideas about independence in Puerto Rico, Madrid imposed ruthless military control. The most memorable incident occurred in 1868 in the mountain town of Lares, when government forces crushed an uprising of secessionists, killing or jailing the insurgents, and many innocent victims. The event is remembered as El Grito de Lares (the cry of Lares).<n>The colonial government could not, however, hold back the tide of change sweeping the Caribbean. In 1872, one momentous decree abolished the 350-year-old institution of slavery in Puerto Rico, and in 1897 Spain cut the colonial ties and finally granted the island autonomy. The long dream of independence seemed to have come true. But eight months after Madrid had authorized home rule for Puerto Rico, American troops arrived to take it away.<n>The Spanish-American War was no great challenge for the US force that landed at Guánica, on Puerto Rico’s calm south coast, rather than at fortified San Juan. Military resistance was spotty at best. By starting at the soft underbelly, the 16,000 troops of General Nelson A. Miles gained control of the island in less than three weeks. The central issue that had drawn Spain and the United States into war — Cuba’s struggle for independence — was resolved in that island’s favor: Cuba’s freedom was guaranteed by the Paris Treaty of 1898. But Spain’s two other major colonies, the Philippines and Puerto Rico, simply changed hands, becoming colonies of the United States.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-History.txt
Guayaberas. The best-dressed Puerto Rican gentlemen wear these tailored, embroidered shirts for many occasions.<n>Hammocks. The old Indian industry is still alive here. Hammocks come in a remarkable variety of styles, colors, and sizes (a miniature model for your cat, a double-wide hammock for the adventurous).<n>Imported goods. Window-shopping reveals surprises galore: Swiss watches, Indian saris, Balinese sarongs, German crystal, and more.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhatToDo.txt
Opposite the entrance to the Barracks is the long white building that houses the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. A new museum is planned for this space, but in the meantime temporary art exhibitions display the best of Puerto Rican painting and sculpture.<n>Follow Calle Beneficencia, the street leading off the right side of the barracks, back towards town. You’ll soon come to a small square on your left with a huge totemic sculpture. This is Plaza del Quinto Centenario (Quincentenary Square). The sculpture symbolizes the 500 years of Puerto Rico’s existence. On close inspection, Amerindian and Spanish themes can be seen, but some elements are a little obscure.<n>Walk on to reach another small square, Plaza San José (San José Square), one of the gems of the city. Situated close to El Morro, it was once one of the most important squares in San Juan. In the center is a statue of Juan Ponce de León in full regalia that was cast in 1797 from the iron of a British cannon, confiscated after their unsuccessful attack on the city. Edged by historic buildings, the square has changed little since the 17th century, except that many of the houses have been converted to restaurants and bars. This is a good place to come after dark and watch the world go by.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt

The plain white façade reflects the sunlight, helping cool the interior. The body of Ponce de León was interred here for over 300 years before being moved to the San Juan Cathedral in 1908. Attached to the church is a large building that was originally a Dominican Convent. It was an army barracks until 1966, when it was taken under the auspices of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. You can enter the main square and see the three cloistered floors that flank it. Art exhibitions are held here regularly.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
The whole area is a place of staggering proportions: there are over 200 species of native trees. One specimen is said to be over 2,500 years old; some trees are so wide it takes several people to reach around them; others soar hundreds of feet into the air. The forest gets over 180 inches (41���2 m) of rain each year — that’s some 100 billion gallons (450 billion liters) of water. The animals that live here are also amazing. This is one of the last habitats of the threatened Puerto Rican parrot. The infamous coquí (see page 47)is, of course, heard everywhere. All in all, the park in an impressive sight, with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance.<n>Arriving via Route 191 you’ll come right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park. This facility presents important information about the history of the park, its plant and animal species, and its role in the local ecology. You can then travel on higher into the park, toward the summit. You can’t drive the whole 8 miles (13 km) between the visitors center and the end of the road, but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way, so there’s ample access. Two popular stops are La Coca Falls, on the right after the 5-mile (8-km) point, and the Yokahú Observation Tower, at the 51⁄2-mile (9-km) point. Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes. The most spectacular cascade in the park, La Mina Falls, is just a 30-minute walk from the roadside, via Big Tree Trail.<n>Take a walk on any of the well-marked trails: the atmosphere is humid and the vegetation constantly damp (your best friends will be your insect repellent and your stout shoes), but the landscape is beautiful and fascinating.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Culebra, much smaller at 21 sq miles (34 sq km), is north of Vieques. It is the largest rock in a collection of over twenty that attract sailors and divers from the main island. Culebra was known as the Spanish Virgin Island until the American takeover — it lies halfway between Puerto Rico and St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. Its only town is named Dewey, after Admiral George Dewey, a hero of the American-Spanish War of 1898. The local people are more apt to call it Pueblo.<n>Culebra is full of natural beauty: beaches (Flamenco is the most celebrated), clear waters full of marine life, and land awash with flowers. Most people come just to sit on the beach or walk in the fresh air. Much of the island is now managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, to preserve the environment. It makes an interesting day trip from Puerto Rico and a total contrast to hot days in the streets of Old San Juan.<n>The Southeast<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Puerto Rico’s second city, Ponce is as much steeped in history as Old San Juan. Founded in 1692, it was named after a relative of Juan Ponce de León, not the famous explorer himself. Ponce is a thriving port city, very modern in many ways, but it lives up to its name of “Pearl of the South.” At the very heart of the city is a jewel of an old town, well-preserved thanks to a massive and expensive restoration program begun in the 1980s. Hundreds of careworn buildings were brought back to life, and power cables were buried underground and out of sight. Along with this physical transformation came a cultural change: Ponce has become a focus for social events that celebrate Puerto Rican history and tradition; several major festivals are held here throughout the year.<n>The focus of the city is Parque Degetau in Plaza Las Delicias (Delight Square), known by most locals as Plaza de Ponce. Most of what you want to see is within a few minutes’ walk of this plaza, and cafés and restaurants for refreshments are also near at hand. You can spend a wonderful morning just soaking in the atmosphere. The park, with its shady trees, cooling fountains, and somber bronze statues, including one of Luis Muñoz Marín, is where people come to take a break from the midday heat. There’s also a good ice-cream shop on the east side of the square.<n>At the heart of the square is the Cathedral of our Lady of Guadalupe, the city’s main place of worship since the late 1600s. Steady streams of visitors step inside to light a candle. Behind the cathedral is perhaps the most famous building in the city, the Parque de Bombas. This small museum to the city’s firefighters looks as though it were designed by a child and colored with crayons. Ornate wooden domes sitting atop four turrets that are painted in the brightest red and black stripes and highlighted with brilliant yellow. The structure was erected for a trade fair in 1882 and taken over by the bomba or firemen’s organization. The displays detail the bravery of individuals who fought fires in the once mostly wooden old town.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
While at La Guancha you may see groups of people across the narrow bay staring down into the water. More likely than not, they’re trying to catch sight of the giant tarpon that have taken to swimming around in the shallows. Hundreds of these fish — some are up to 7 ft (2 m) long — congregate here because they’ve learned they’ll be well supplied with tasty tidbits offered by the humans on shore.<n>North of Ponce are attractions of a different kind. Take Route 503 out of town — this road runs along the banks of the Río Portuguéz — and after about a mile and a half (2 km) you’ll arrive at the Tibes Indian Ceremonial Park, one of the most important Amerindian archaeological sites in the Caribbean. The ceremonial site and cemetery are across the river, and you may not enter without a guide. A small museum explains the known history of the Amerindian races; it has a number of cabinets holding artifacts, as well as a skeleton, still in the traditional fetal burial position. Once you’re into the park, the ceremonial grounds come into view. Open spaces discovered since the 1960s are now believed to be used for “ball games,” which had an important though as yet only poorly understood ceremonial purpose in Indian culture.<n>High in the hills behind Ponce is Hacienda Buena Vista. To get there, take Route 10, a major north-south artery. The road climbs steeply into dense vegetation and cooler air before you see signs for the hacienda; the climate and environmental conditions here were ideal for the coffee that the plantation began to grow more than 150 years ago. The plantation fell into neglect in the 20th century, but since 1984 it has been returned to its original state by The Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico. Agricultural machinery such as coffee bean huskers can be seen in the original buildings, and the water mill and canals, which harnessed the power of the Canas River, are now in working order. The facility shows how plantations used to operate and offer a fascinating insight into agricultural life in Puerto Rico all those years ago. Advance reservations are required for the tours (see page 64).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Mexico’s folkloric traditions have become the centerpiece of the modern “Mexican Fiesta,” created especially with the tourist in mind. These full evenings of entertainment generally include a makeshift marketplace featuring artesanía for sale, a buffet Mexican dinner, games (involving drinking large quantities of tequila), mariachi music, a presentation of folkloric dance from around the country, and a generous supply of margaritas and other beverages. Most of the time these are smallish presentations, with dances performed by amateur groups; at their worst, they can be truly gaudy and almost laughable shows.<n>The exception is in Acapulco. The Centro de Convenciones offers arguably the best Fiesta Mexicana in the country, and is the closest you’ll come to an authentic display of Mexican culture and dance. Along with beautifully performed folkloric dances from all over Mexico, you’ll witness a pre-Hispanic ceremony called Los Voladores de Papantla, which represents an invocation to the four cardinal points and a prayer for fertility; a floreador roping exhibition; and the vibrant sounds of the mariachi. This fiesta is held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 7 to 10pm. Reservations are recommended, to ensure a good table. For reservations, call Tel. (7) 484-7046.<n>In Puerto Vallarta one fiesta that stands out from the rest is not a traditional Fiesta Mexicana at all, but an evening at the secluded Caletas cove, accessible only by boat. Ritmos de la Noche (“Rhythms of the Night”) is a truly magical experience. You travel by fast catamarans to the former home of John Huston, where you’ll be greeted by native drums and abundant tiki torches — there is no electricity here — then dine by candlelight at tables set along the secluded beach. Following dinner, the jungle, sounds of nature, and a replica of a pyramid are the backdrop for a performance of pre-Hispanic dances with a unique contemporary choreographic twist. The show is held from Monday through Saturday. Call Tel. (3) 221-0657, for reservations.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt
Manzanillo, Ixtapa, and Zihuatanejo offer less in the way of nightlife. Manzanillo’s clubs are few, but crowded, and feature recorded music for dancing. The Latin music clubs get going around 10pm, and don’t even show up before midnight at the techno and alternative clubs. The majority of clubs, and the ubiquitous Carlos ‘n’ Charlie’s, are located along the main boulevard, Miguel de la Madrid. In Ixtapa, sunset happy hours offer the most options, and Mexican fiestas seem to be a “best bet” for a complete evening. Other later night offerings are a sampling of what you’ll find in any resort town in Mexico: Christine’s disco at the Krystal Hotel, Sr. Frogs, and Carlos ‘n’ Charlie’s. The only really original option here is the club, La Valentina, a combination restaurant/video bar with a desert-inspired décor.<n>There is no doubt that Acapulco rules when it comes to nightlife. In fact, I would venture that most visitors here come especially for that. Anyone that believes disco is dead hasn’t been to Acapulco — it’s alive and well, and happens nightly in an array of clubs that get going around midnight and often close after the sun comes up. The most majestic of these, Enigma, Palladium, and Fantasy, are located in the Las Brisas section of town, with towering, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking stunning views of Acapulco Bay in all its night-lit splendor.<n>Along the main Hotel Zone, clubs are closed-in, but still offer sultry-hot music made for dancing; among them are Alebriges, Andromeda, and Baby-O. The Condessa stretch of the Costera is host to a string of open-air beach bars, with the most popular being Disco Beach, El Sombrero, and the pirate-theme Barbaroja. These offer dancing under the stars with a view of the ocean. The crowd here is young — very young — and the general rule is that one cover charge entitles you to all you can drink. Special coupons are handed out aggressively on the beaches during the day, in hopes of luring the biggest crowd that night.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt

If you like the adventure of traveling through the jungle, Vallarta Adventure in Puerto Vallarta, offers an extraordinary tour of the Sierra Madre Mountains on board Mercedes Benz all-terrain vehicles (called Unimogs). The tour includes a visit to a secluded beach and a detailed explanation of the flora and fauna of the area.<n>Lovers of speed and thrill-seekers will enjoy the fast-paced tour along the Papagayo River, 72 km (48 miles) north of Acapulco. Shotover-Jet (Tel. (7) 484-1154), travels aboard specially-designed 12-passenger turbo boats, which come screaming up to the face of the canyon, and then make a fast spin before continuing up the river, while making repeated 360° turns. To say that it’s a rush is an understatement, and their eco-conscious pamphlet is good for a chuckle, considering the reality of the experience. They are, however, making new rafting excursions available for those who prefer to experience the Papagayo River a little closer to its natural state.<n>Spectator Sports<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt
South of El Centro, yet still considered to be a part of Viejo Vallarta, is the area alternately known as “Los Muertos” and “Zona Romántica.” The neighborhood is named for the main beach in town, Los Muertos (the Dead) — however, the city fathers prefer a kinder, gentler nomenclature, and have unsuccessfully tried to rename it “Zona Romántica,” and the beach, “Playa del Sol” (just so you’ll know when you see the many street signs). From family-run beachfront hotels to eclectic inns poised on the surrounding hills, here is where you feel the essence of Vallarta’s charms — the area preferred by independent travelers and repeat visitors. New sidewalk cafés, bookstores, and martini bars have popped up along the main road, Olas Altas, giving it a decidedly bohemian, funky feel. This part of town also is home to “Restaurant Row” (along Basilio Badillo) and Rockin’ Row (Ignacio L. Vallarta, just beyond the southbound bridge). This perpendicular meeting of streets contains something for every taste and budget, in both dining and nightlife.<n>Immediately south of Viejo Vallarta is the fashionable residential neighborhood of Conchas Chinas, with numerous villas for rent, and a few hotels set into the cliffside. Extending from Conchas Chinas along the South Shore, the landscape changes to dramatic mountains that tumble toward the sea. Tucked into the private coves of this coast, you’ll find a collection of full-service hotels made to order for honeymoons and romantic escapes. At the end of this stretch of shore, you’ll come to Mismaloya Bay, where you can still climb up the ridge to the ruins of the set built for the Night of the Iguana.<n>Day Trips from Puerto Vallarta<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt
Though Acapulco is, admittedly, past its prime, there are still plenty of reasons to visit and numerous ways to enjoy the famously sunny days there. Acapulco remains Mexico’s most traditional resort for those looking for a beach, yet also want to feel as if they’ve been to Mexico. Where other resorts in Mexico have been accused of being homogenized to meet the tastes of North American travelers, Acapulco remains true to her essence, from the cacophony of families filling colorful, public sands, to the classically late nights in glitzy clubs.<n>And Acapulco has one thing that no other place has — the absolutely stunning view of Acapulco Bay, which, day or night, is an image as memorable as any you’ll come across in your travels.<n>Acapulco is more of a city than other Pacific coastal destinations, with high-rise hotels lined up like dominoes around the edge of the bay. It offers more options for dining, shopping, and other activities than anywhere else along Mexico’s western shoreline; many are geared for families.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt
