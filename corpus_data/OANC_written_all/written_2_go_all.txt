The information-integrated channels developed in the United States, which are now influencing sourcing patterns from Mexico and the Caribbean Basin, have begun to affect the textile and apparel sectors worldwide. For many fashion apparel products—defined as those planned to last only one season—the practice of sourcing on the basis of lowest labor costs may be expected to continue. Indeed, much of Asian sourcing has been devoted to such items, with production shifting within Asia away from regions where wage levels have risen. But for basic and fashion basic apparel products, for which frequent replenishment orders are becoming the norm, the practice of sourcing some of the assembly and sewing operations from nearby lower wage regions and countries is emerging. At the same time, design, distribution centers, marketing—even cutting—as well as some short-cycle assembly remain in the market region.<n>As we pointed out in Chapter 13, regionalization of apparel production in three main areas has started to occur. In the U.S. market, most sewing operations take place in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin; in Europe, sewing operations go to North Africa, Turkey, and Eastern Europe; and in Japan, sewing operations go to various East Asian regions. The formal analysis in Chapter 7 specified the factors that determine whether production of items under rapid replenishment policies should be done domestically or outsourced to low wage countries.<n>For textiles, with their high capital costs, lower labor content, and emphasis on high quality and finishing operations, the concentration in the southeastern United States, Korea and Japan, and industrial Europe may be expected largely to continue. But the longer term viability of American textile centers will depend on the development of infrastructures capable of supporting advanced textile production in countries close to the U.S. market, such as Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch15.txt
A second method has involved mobilizing public pressure on consumers, retailers, and manufacturers to raise the incentives for voluntary compliance with labor standards. For example, the Secretary of Labor has used his or her “bully pulpit” to call attention to the problem, urging the public, retailers, and manufacturers to avoid purchasing products made in workplaces that do not meet the standards.27 Various reports have also publicized government enforcement actions to deter contractors, jobbers, manufacturers, and retailers from violating the standards, such as the release of a series of government reports on the extent of violations and the penalties assessed against violators.28 In yet another example, Duke University’s adoption of a code of conduct to ensure that apparel items bearing the university’s name are not made in sweatshops has received public support.29<n>Indeed, efforts to use public concern, and at times outrage, to tackle the sweatshop problem go back to the early part of this century. The most famous case involves public reaction to the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company on March 25, 1911, in which 146 women died. The fire started in a loft of the factory during the workday. The women and girls working in the factory could not escape because the company had locked the doors to the stairs from the outside, ostensibly to prevent theft by employees. The lack of fire extinguishers within the factory and the inability of fire ladders to reach the windows made escape impossible. In this case, public outrage led to early workers’ compensation and factory inspection legislation.<n>But, in general, the effectiveness of focusing public attention on sweatshops and poor labor conditions has been limited by the difficulty of keeping consumers, voters, students, or other groups working on this issue for sustained periods of time. Such avenues are at best a means for focusing the attention of key parties in order to build longer term mechanisms that remain even after public attention wanes.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch15.txt
The NRF fields a deluge of calls each week about the Internet’s impact on retailing. The most common question we get from reporters: “How long will it take for the Internet to completely replace physical retailing?” We have observed that traditional retailers are taking a cautious approach to the Internet. Yet most understand its great potential, even if they openly admit they don’t have all the answers.43<n>A limited number of retailers are currently experimenting with the Internet, although only 9 percent of those surveyed in 1998 indicated that they currently sell products this way.44 Retailers are currently reluctant to go on-line both because they believe that their products are “ill-suited for Web sales” and are concerned about specific technical limitations, such as the security of electronic financial transactions.45<n>A number of developments, many linked to issues we have discussed, indicate both the potential and limitations of electronic retailing. In one sense, the Internet offers opportunities akin to mail-order retailing for playing a very lean game. For example, Lands’ Ends became an early leader in adopting certain lean retailing elements into its catalog operations and has aggressively entered Internet retailing. This retailer launched its Web site in 1995, the first major apparel retailer to do so. Its site incorporates an encryption system to protect customers against credit-card thefts.46<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch15.txt
The Internet provides some of the advantages of mail-order sales with even lower transaction costs. However, the obstacles to virtual retailing remain formidable. Product offerings are limited in Web retail sites—the Lands’ End site, for example, offered only 500 products in 1997. In addition, just as in other areas of modern retailing, a company must have a distribution system capable of getting products out efficiently on an order-by-order basis, either through internal resources or use of third-party consolidators. The economics of distribution for Web retailing, like catalog retailing, are therefore quite different from those developed even by advanced in-store lean retailers.<n>Finally, measurement, fit, color, and texture remain central components of apparel sales. In apparel—unlike the sale of goods via the Internet such as computers, software, or tools—people want to see, feel, and try on the products. These aspects of selling apparel items do not fit well with “virtual retailing.” The mail-order business already contends with this problem, and these retailers cope with returns that sometimes go over one-quarter the value of sales in a given year. Consider Lands’ End once more. In 1991 (well before its entrance to the Internet), it was forced to cope with returns of 132,000 shirts. Each return was associated with a processing cost roughly equivalent to 25 percent of its value.47 Thus, although Internet retailing will certainly grow as a channel of distribution, the most essential longer term developments will involve the expansion of lean retailing principles to a wider and wider variety of goods sold by a decreasing number of major retailers.<n>The Apparel Industry Horizon<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch15.txt
The amount of variation in weekly demand exhibited in Figure 7.2 is quite remarkable, especially if we consider that the manufacturer’s demand is based on the total sales of this SKU in over a thousand retail outlets each week. It is important to note also that this product was not promoted at retail with discounted prices at any time during this period, so the variation is not due to consumers preferring to purchase a product when it was “on sale.” In addition, the demand peak for the 43-regular occurs in week 10, which was only an average demand week for the 46-regular.<n>It is useful to outline the ordering and manufacturing processes on a weekly basis to see how this manufacturer’s inventory policies might differ for the two different sizes. Suppose that, as described in Chapter 6, the retailer consolidates POS data for the previous week’s sales each Sunday night and places a replenishment order with our manufacturer. On Monday, the manufacturer (1) processes the order; (2) picks and packs the desired items from finished goods inventory and ships them to the retailer; and (3) places a factory order to manufacture those items that it shipped that day. Assume that the manufacturing lead time—the amount of time required to go from a production order to a product ready for shipping to retail—is less than one week. Then, by the following Monday, the items ordered the previous week would be completed at the factory and available in the manufacturer’s finished goods inventory. At this point, the manufacturer’s inventory is restored to the “target” level it had the previous week and is ready to fill the next week’s retail replenishment order.<n>For the popular 46-regular coat, weekly demand never exceeds twice the coat’s average demand. Thus, as long as the lead time for producing more coats in size 46-regular is less than a week, the manufacturer could hold two weeks’ worth of inventory and be able to fill—immediately—retail orders that replenish the previous week’s demand. That is, it could set a target stock level of two weeks of finished goods inventory and be able to provide a very high customer service level (defined here as order-fulfillment rate) to retailers.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt
Of course, a firm that relies on multiple production plants has a more complex problem than the example just presented. Not only must it set inventory levels and schedule production for each product, but it must choose which products to assemble in each plant. In many cases, the choice is between a more expensive plant—probably located close to the market—that provides shorter lead times and a more distant supplier that takes longer to make items but does so at a lower unit cost. Under the traditional retailing system, suppliers filled an order by carrying out assembly in the least costly plant, as long as its quality was adequate for the market for which the product was destined. In a lean retailing world, however, factors other than the direct costs of assembly and transportation need to be considered.<n>Caught between lean retailers’ need for immediate replenishment and the high risk of carrying inventory for products with uncertain demand, a manufacturer today must go beyond traditional direct costs and also include manufacturing lead times and inventory carrying costs in its sourcing equation. Most production managers instinctively believe that having at least some manufacturing capability close to the market adds value to the company, but expressing that value in dollars and cents, and making specific allocations of products to plants, are difficult.<n>Manufacturers—whether of suits, CDs, office products, or pasta—generally classify products in terms of product lines. Planning, therefore, is done for fall fashion lines, jazz ensemble CDs, yellow legal pads, or fettuccine pasta products. Even if this method of categorization is important from a marketing perspective, it often glosses over what is, in fact, common to many products that seem different and different about products that seem the same. Once again, demand variability is key. For our men’s suit manufacturer, the men’s size 43-regular coat may have less in common with the size 46-regular coat in the same size and color than with a fashionable boy’s blazer.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch7.txt
Although many apparel manufacturers do have in-house designers, most of the work of garment design comes in adjusting previous -patterns or small elements of existing garments—say, the trim or the fabric—and is more a matter of technical creation than a flight of fancy. Consider the expansion of basic and fashion-basic garments in the U.S. market. For T-shirts, sweatpants, and different types of jeans, the design elements that change annually may only amount to a change of color, fit of the jeans, or the addition of a pocket to sweatpants.<n>Traditionally, a new apparel design was created by asking the designer/artist to make a watercolor sketch. If the fabric was to have a pattern, there might also be a close-up colored sketch of it. Many designs would be grouped together into a storyboard, which was then presented to managers for final decisions. Next the designs that passed this stage went through a technical design step in which details were added and patterns made. After this step, fabric might be cut and a sample made to see how it would look on a mannequin. If the new garment was a blouse, for example, the designer might wish to see how it looked with skirts planned for the collection. If the designer was not satisfied with the drape of the garment, the fit, or the pattern, he or she might go back to square one. Several iterations of these initial design steps could add weeks or months to the process before production began.<n>Although some haute couture or high-end apparel designers may still work in this manner, each year more garments are designed using computer technology. In our survey, 40 percent of the business units reported using Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) systems to prepare new products in 1992. Employing CAD was particularly common among the largest business units in our sample. The use of modern design tools and information technology can collapse the design time so that managerial decision-making becomes the longest step in the process—and even the time for that step can be shortened with information technology. The new way allows the designer to work creatively with a computer pen or brush to outline the sketch, which appears on a computer screen. The computer can “watercolor” the sketch and produce the storyboard for presentation. Once past the first steps, these systems let designers drape fabric patterns on sketches or photographs of people on the computer screen. For example, sketches or photos can be draped with material of different colors and patterns. The size of the pattern can be changed and the visual images compared to get a sense of their appeal. And a colored ink-jet printing of the pattern can be made on basic plain fabric to help identify and demonstrate the desired colors in future discussions with textile mills.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
Mass Customization<n>The percentage of the population wearing factory-made apparel has grown steadily since the nineteenth century. Some still rely on custom-made clothing, especially those who have to go this route because of their size and shape or those with the money to afford custom tailoring. Although many might like to have customized clothing, few consider it a realistic option. It is only recently that “mass customization” may make sense for both consumers and apparel-makers.10<n>Mass customization involves a number of preassembly innovations. When somebody orders custom-made clothing, his or her measurements are taken by a fitter in a store and, three to six weeks later, the garment appears. In this case, how was the suit, shirt, pants, or pair of jeans made? Were all the preassembly steps followed or did an individual tailor cut the cloth and make the entire garment? The answers depend on the garment as well as on just how “custom-made” it really was. Regardless of how customization was done in the past, consumers paid more for the end product. Mass customization, however, has the potential to make “tailor fit” at least somewhat less expensive, as new systems combine features of the efficient factory system with attention to at least a few critical customer measurements.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch8.txt
Each day, the manager looks over the factory floor to see if any carts with a particular flag color are falling behind the others of that group. Delays in product flow can result from machine problems, worker absence, or if priority is given to special orders. In some plants, the carts may contain up to a day’s worth of work. Although this may appear to be a crude way of keeping track of the work flow, it is simple and generally effective. Still, work almost never progresses in perfect lockstep through a factory. Finding the correct parts for a shirt can often involve a hunt through the plant. For example, a worker might accidentally leave a bundle of unfinished work in the cart when it goes back to be loaded again. Because a worker may have a day’s work in the carts in front of her, it is easy to see how individual bundles of parts can be misplaced—which, in turn, will hold up the assembly of some SKUs. Partially finished shirts and shirt subassemblies will then be in a number of places in the factory.<n>This shirt factory employs 250 workers. If the shirt in question is rated to require twelve minutes to assemble, such as the one in the figure, a forty-hour work week will produce 4,167 dozen shirts when the factory is operating at standard efficiency. (Of course, many plants may fall below the standard and take longer than twelve minutes to make that shirt.)10 A typical time for a shirt to go through the plant is four weeks, which means the plant will have 16,667 dozen shirts as work-in-process (WIP). The forty operations indicated in the figure may require only twelve minutes if the operators are working at 100 percent efficiency, but any given shirt still takes twenty working days to pass through the plant. To shorten the time significantly, the work-in-process in front of each of the twenty operations listed as part of the critical path would have to be reduced from a day to just several hours. Not all the forty different operations are sequential; the parts assembly goes on in parallel, but the final assembly involves a series of eleven operations that require all the subassemblies to be completed and ready to be mated with the correct parts.<n>Needless to say, reduction of throughput time is not a simple task. Some of the forty operations require very little time; others are much longer. Hemming the top of a shirt pocket is a short operation, for example, but it takes longer to attach the pocket and longer still if stripes must be matched. If there is one operator for the short operation, then there will have to be several operators for the longer one just to keep the production line in balance. If any one of the several operators speeds up or slows down, the line becomes unbalanced. If the imbalance lasts for more than an hour or so, the factory manager would have to take corrective action. A utility operator skilled in several operations might be brought over from another area to move work past the slow sewing station. Clearly, it is easier for the manager to keep all operators supplied with work, especially since in most cases the work-in-process for each operator is large. The large buffers are designed so that natural daily variations in work rhythm do not cause a major disruption. In fact, a production line is probably never in perfect balance. If it were, when even one worker in the plant changed her pace, the line would drift out of balance.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
As work progresses through a typical sewing plant, it is also common for a special order to disrupt the flow. Even if the special order does not require a thread change, as with most dress shirts, someone will have to move the order to the front of the queue at each sewing station and combine the parts for final assembly.<n>We have visited a top-of-the-line men’s suit plant in Sweden where a special order would go through the plant in four working days, rather than the normal six weeks, just by allowing the work to go to the head of the work buffer at each sewing station. In this suit plant, work was moved from one station to the next by a Unit Production System (UPS). A UPS is a mechanical overhead transport system that moves a unit of clothing from one work station to the next. The mechanical device generally carries all parts of the finished garment. After a sewing operator finishes one step, the carrier is sent on its way to the next. There is a finite mechanical buffer area before each operator; when the buffer fills, the next unit is automatically sent to another operator who does the same operation.<n>With a UPS delivery system, factory throughput time can be dramatically reduced. But the cost required to install such a system is steep, running to $4,000 or more per workstation. The high cost and lack of production-floor flexibility after the mechanical conveyers are installed have limited the number of factories adopting these systems. In 1992, only 3.5 percent of the output of our surveyed business units was assembled using UPS. A competing approach to reducing plant throughput time involves team-based sewing or modular production, which we will discuss at length in the next chapter. In that case, groups of sewing operators are trained in more than one assembly operation. Workers move from one sewing station to another, guiding the work-in-process through the plant.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
The traditional system of apparel assembly was designed to minimize the direct labor costs of assembly, not production throughput time. The progressive bundle system, with up to a day’s WIP waiting for each sewing operator was an efficient way of operating when the costs of carrying mountains of WIP did not enter into production costs. Generally, under this system of apparel assembly all production was made to fill an actual order. The risk of inventory was carried by the retailer who placed the order, so apparel operators carried large WIP (in 1988 for our sample an average of 3.65 weeks worth).<n>But under rapid replenishment arrangements, the inventory risk is now assumed by the apparel manufacturer; consequently assembly time is now very important. As shown in the cases studied in Chapter 7, production-cycle time and inventory carrying costs are two crucial parameters in making rapid replenishment sourcing decisions. When the assembly cycle time is reduced, both the WIP and finished goods inventory levels necessary to meet a given rapid replenishment demand go down.<n>The possibility of mass customization for some apparel items presents another market opportunity that demands short-cycle production. If a retail customer pays a premium for a custom pair of jeans, dress shirt, or suit, that customer will expect the item to be delivered to her home within days, not weeks or months. We are a nation of last-minute shoppers, and mass customization will have to compete against overnight delivery of apparel items with less than perfect fit from a specialty catalog company. Speed of delivery has increasingly become part of the competitive equation.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Abernathy_ch9.txt
Despite grim work lives, Rosie and Henry, who had little schooling themselves, sent nine of their children to college and some to graduate school. They managed to be involved and caring parents, without all the comforts and time-saving conveniences that we now take for granted—a water-tight roof; central heating; fast foods; microwaves; vacuum cleaners; washing machines and dryers; automobiles; telephones; and much, much more.<n>Though Rosie’s and Henry’s way of life was hard, and we shouldn’t go too far in romanticizing it, their story helps us put the contemporary time bind in perspective. It suggests that many parents who feel overwhelmed by life’s demands ought to be able to free up more time for their children—the ﬁrst step toward high-quality child rearing. Recent research by time-allocation experts John Robinson and Georey Godbey substantiates this conclusion. Although Americans perceive their work hours as excessive, squeezing out other aspects of their lives, a dierent picture emerges when they keep detailed diaries of how they spend their time. Every 10 years since 1965, Robinson and Godbey have gathered daily time diaries from thousands of respondents, representing a cross-section of the American population. They discovered that not only are people’s gross estimates of time per week devoted to work 6 to 8 hours higher than those recorded in their diaries, but free time—time unencumbered by any obligations—has actually increased!<n>Americans are working less than they did in 1965—about 6 fewer hours per week for men, 5 fewer for women.52 Diary-obtained estimates of free time average 36 hours per week for employed men, 34 for employed women. Robinson and Godbey note that compared to a generation ago, the free time of Americans is more plentiful but also more disjointed—a half hour here, an hour there. How do they spend it? Americans report that TV viewing consumes nearly 40 percent—about 15 hours—of their unallocated moments. It seems easier to watch the news or an episode of a favorite TV show than to go to a concert, enjoy a leisurely family dinner, or take the children to a museum or the zoo.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt

How does early experience join with biology to aect brain development? The cerebral cortex, seat of human intelligence, undergoes dramatic growth during the ﬁrst few years. Almost all its neurons—cells that store and transmit information—are in place by the second trimester of pregnancy. Once established, neurons begin to take on unique functions by sending out branching ﬁbers, which form elaborate connections with other neurons. Formation of this complex communication system contributes to an enormous increase in size of the brain—from nearly 30 percent of its adult weight at birth to 70 percent by age 2 and 90 percent by age 6.57<n>As neurons form connections, a new factor becomes vital in their survival: stimulation. Neurons stimulated by the surrounding environment continue to establish new connections, which support more complex functions. Neurons seldom stimulated soon lose their connections as their ﬁbers atrophy. Notice how, for the biological side of brain development to go forward, appropriate stimulation is essential while formation of neural connections is at its peak.58<n>During early childhood, the brain is highly plastic, or adaptable, in that many brain regions are not yet committed to speciﬁc functions. This means that if a part of the brain is damaged, other parts can usually take over the tasks that would have been handled by the damaged region, provided they are granted the necessary stimulation. In a study of preschool children with a wide variety of brain injuries sustained in the ﬁrst year of life, psychologist Joan Stiles found that cognitive deﬁcits were milder than those observed in brain-injured adults. And by age 5, virtually all impairments had disappeared! As the children gained perceptual, cognitive, and motor experiences, stimulated intact areas of the cerebral cortex compensated for the early damage.59 By age 8 to 10, most brain regions have taken on speciﬁc functions, so brain plasticity declines. Because of rapid brain growth and gradual decline in brain plasticity, the ﬁrst 5 to 8 years of life are regarded as a sensitive phase of development in which appropriate stimulation is necessary for children to reach their full genetic potential.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
Much research conﬁrms that overloading children with input leads to disorganization of behavior. Excessive stimulation also causes them to withdraw as they try to shield themselves from a stimulus deluge, thereby creating conditions that, paradoxically, are much like stimulus deprivation!61 These ﬁndings help us understand, from a brain-development perspective, the detrimental impact of excessive adult tutoring on young children, described earlier in this chapter. They also raise grave concerns about the recent proliferation of expensive commercial early learning centers, in which infants are barraged with letter and number ﬂashcards and slightly older toddlers are drenched in a full curriculum of reading, math, science, art, music, gym, and more.62 Rather than optimizing early neurological growth (as proponents claim), these eorts to jump-start young children can inﬂict considerable harm, robbing them of a healthy start on the road to maturity.63<n>Our rapidly expanding knowledge base on brain development and children’s learning reveals that a genetically inﬂuenced roadmap for brain growth and a developmentally appropriate environment go hand in hand; the impact of each depends on the other. Appropriate stimulation “wires” the brain, prompting it to form new connections and its regions to specialize. As this process goes forward, the brain gradually becomes receptive to increasingly complex and varied stimulation. This fosters further elaboration and specialization of brain structures and ever more advanced knowledge and skills.<n>temperament.  From the earliest ages, children vary greatly in preferences, interests, talents—and in temperament, or style of emotional responding, the most thoroughly studied of these sources of individual variation. Temperament encompasses activity level, ability to attend to stimuli, and capacity to adjust the intensity of emotions to a comfortable level so the child can remain adaptively engaged with his or her physical and social surroundings.64<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
To illustrate how Vygotsky envisioned this close connection between social interaction and children’s thinking and behaving, let’s look in on another verbal exchange between a parent and a young child. Deb is pulling weeds in the garden while 2 1/2-year-old Maggy follows along, alternately digging with her small spade and holding a toy telephone to her ear. Soon gray clouds appear along the horizon, and thunder can be heard. Maggy, frightened by the booming sounds, whimpers to Deb, “Scary, Mommy. Go inside!”<n>“That thunder is way up in the sky, far away,” Deb explains, pointing o in the distance. “It can’t hurt you. We need to get these weeds out before the rain comes. Just a little longer, and then we’ll go inside.”<n>Maggy listens and responds, “Not scary, far far away,” and Deb nods in agreement. As Maggy waits, she paces back and forth near Deb, speaking into her toy phone, “Not scary thunder. Far away. Get the weeds. Not scary, boom boom! Like a big drum.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
Maggy listens and responds, “Not scary, far far away,” and Deb nods in agreement. As Maggy waits, she paces back and forth near Deb, speaking into her toy phone, “Not scary thunder. Far away. Get the weeds. Not scary, boom boom! Like a big drum.”<n>Maggy has taken the communication jointly generated with her mother and turned it toward herself. She uses speech derived from that conversation to reﬂect on the thunder, allay her fear, and help her wait until Deb’s task is ﬁnished and they can go inside. As Maggy “thinks aloud” with words, she converses with herself, in much the same way that she interacted with her mother. Over time, Maggy will start to interact with herself silently, “inside her head.” And as Maggie’s social experiences expand and become more complex, she will continue to weave aspects of them into her inner dialogues, acquiring new, more advanced ways of thinking.<n>A ﬁnal point about thinking as internalized social interaction: Note that Maggy’s telephone conversation with herself is not a simple copy of Deb’s remarks to her. The sociocultural vision is very dierent from behaviorism, which views development as directly imposed, or shaped, by external forces. Instead, children are active agents, contributing to the creation of their own thought processes by collaborating with more experienced cultural members in meaningful activities. The combination of child and adult leads to the communication between them. Then children actively take over this interaction and gradually adapt it for ecient and eective self-communication, shortening and personalizing it.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch1.txt
Talia and Jim’s fear of helping 7-year-old Anselmo with his homework, lest they create a dependent, immature child, is a peculiarly Western—and profoundly American—preoccupation. American middle-class parents typically regard young children as dependent beings who must be urged toward independence. In response to researchers’ queries, they frequently say that babies should be trained to be self-reliant from the ﬁrst few months.1 Consequently, they place a high value on children’s learning and doing on their own. Repeatedly relying on others for assistance is construed as weakness, uncertainty, and lack of capacity. In keeping with this view, many American parents worry that if their children seek help, they may become dependent.<n>A similar view permeates traditional classrooms, where an individualistic value system prevails. Children must “do their own work.” In the most intensely individualistic of these settings, conferring with your neighbor is worse than dependency; it is cheating, and teachers go so far as to set up barriers between pupils, such as upright books and cardboard screens, to prevent it.<n>This emphasis on independent accomplishment is not broadly accepted around the world. Indeed, adults in some non-Western cultures regard American parents as rather merciless in pushing their young children toward independence—for example, when they insist that infants sleep alone rather than with their parents, or when they take pleasure in the earliest possible mastery of motor skills, such as crawling and walking, long before the child has acquired the reasoning powers to avoid steep staircases and busy roadways.2<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
Sydney: I can’t get this one in. (Tries to insert a piece in the wrong place)<n>Father: Which piece might go down here? (Points to the bottom of the puzzle)<n>Sydney: His shoes. (Looks for a piece resembling the clown’s shoes but tries the wrong one)<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
1. Joint Problem Solving, Aimed at Keeping the Child in the “Zone.” Sydney and her father collaborate in overcoming obstacles that Sydney encounters. In doing so, father and daughter jointly work toward successful puzzle solution.<n>Sydney’s father keeps the task within Sydney’s “zone” by temporarily reducing the diculty of the puzzle. He does so by breaking the task into smaller units, focusing Sydney’s attention on the lower section—the part with the largest and most easily matched pieces. Then he assists with a general prompt, “Which piece might go down here?”<n>When Sydney’s father observes that this suggestion is not sucient for her to succeed, he oers additional support, “Find a piece that looks like this shape and matches this color” and “Turn it.” His statements contain strategies (attending to color and shape, patiently adjusting pieces so they ﬁt) that Sydney can use in future attempts. When Sydney experiments with the color-matching strategy and succeeds in placing the brown piece, she internalizes the technique. She applies it in subsequent eorts, regulating her behavior with self-directed language resembling her father’s communication during joint problem solving. Consequently, Sydney begins to move toward independent solving of the puzzle.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
When adults ask children questions and make suggestions that permit them to participate in the discovery of solutions, then transfer of useful strategies to the child is maximized. By introducing language as a mediator of the child’s activity, the adult’s questions and prompts prevent the child from responding impulsively. They encourage the child to step back from the immediate situation and consider alternatives—in essence, to think.<n>Look at Sydney and her father’s dialogue once again. When he asks, “Which piece might go down here?” he evokes Sydney’s present strategic thinking, ﬁnding that it is still tied to immediate objects in the situation. Sydney looks for the clown’s shoes but fails to ﬁnd them. Then her father introduces a special form of strategic thinking called distancing. This method helps children move beyond concrete objects by looking for higher-order relationships—in Sydney’s case, categorizing puzzle pieces by color and shape. Once Sydney succeeds in using color, her father encourages further distancing from the most obvious features of the clown image.44 He places a piece incorrectly (by matching only on color) and queries, “Will that work?” In doing so, he helps Sydney analyze an error, consider how to correct it (by matching on both color and shape), and try out her conjecture. Sydney gains practice in applying strategies ﬂexibly—in generating ideas to overcome obstacles. As a result, she acquires reasoning skills and can take initiative when faced with future problems.<n>3. Warmth, Responsiveness, and Encouragement. To work well, the emotional tone of scaolding must be warm, sympathetic, and responsive. Children who experience warm adult relationships want to preserve that spirit of aection and cooperation—by joining in dialogues with adult partners and acquiring culturally valued skills.45<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt

At times, adults tell children stories that carry important self-relevant lessons. For example, recently I listened in as a father and his 5-year-old son waited in the foyer of a synagogue for a Jewish New Year service to begin. The father wove an animated tale about a boy named Chaim, who had great diculty remaining quiet during the holiday service. Little Chaim had a brand new whistle in his back pocket, and he badly wanted to play it. With great eort, he resisted, turning and twisting in his seat until, ﬁnally, when the Rabbi blew the shofar (ceremonial ram’s horn), Chaim could bear it no longer! A moment later, the clear, high-pitched sound of the whistle could be heard over the Rabbi’s ﬁnal shofar blast. Everyone in the sanctuary turned toward Chaim, who cringed with embarrassment. But much to Chaim’s surprise, all the congregants cheered and thanked him for making the shofar ritual more beautiful than ever. And Chaim’s father praised him for sitting quietly, almost to the end of the service.<n>Five-year-old Mark listened to his father’s story with rapt attention, asking questions and adding personal comments: “Where did Chaim sit?” “Did he (like Mark) bring a book to read?” “Was Chaim allowed to get up and go to the bathroom?” “Was the Rabbi angry at Chaim?” The story disclosed that adults realize a long service is hard for a small boy to sit through, but exercising self-restraint and participating in communal rituals bring praise and acceptance from the community. The analogies Mark drew between his own life and Chaim’s suggest that he had (as his father intended) experienced the story from a personal vantage point, identifying with its events and applying them to himself.71<n>Systematic research reveals both cultural similarities and dierences in adult–child narratives. In an intensive observational study of daily storytelling in two communities—six middle-class Chinese families in Taipei, Taiwan, and six middle-class American families in an Irish-Catholic neighborhood in Chicago—Peggy Miller and her colleagues72 found that preschoolers and their family members routinely narrated past experiences. Most often, they created joint accounts of pleasurable holidays and family excursions—birthday parties, the fair, the zoo, and McDonald’s for the American children; the night market, the zoo, and riding on trains and horses for the Chinese children. Both groups also talked about times the children were ill, sad, or frightened.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
“I can’t remember much family togetherness when I was a kid,” Hannah remarked. “Our parents couldn’t talk things out with each other, and they rarely talked things out with us. Mom took Sarah and me to Girl Scouts, swimming, piano, and other lessons. We enjoyed the activities and the friends we made, but they couldn’t compensate for what was missing: warm, family time. We almost never sat down to a meal together or went places together; we each went our own way. Our dad started going o on vacations by himself when holidays rolled around, so family get-togethers were rare.<n>“When our parents split up, we moved with our mom from Arkansas to Seattle. Mom worked all week, weekends, and most evenings. She had to get a career going so there’d be money to live on and to send us to college. Sarah hung out with another family in the neighborhood. A couple of times a week, she had dinner and went to church with them. Looking back, I’d say they were her substitute family; she ‘adopted’ them, and they ‘adopted’ her. I was too young to go o on my own that way. When I didn’t have after-school activities, Mom insisted that I come home and do chores and homework. Sometimes I got to go to a friend’s house to play, but many nights I’d open a can of spaghetti and have dinner by myself. I spent hours daydreaming and looking at old pictures of Mom, Dad, Sarah, and me.”<n>On ﬁnishing high school, Sarah chose a religiously aliated college of the same denomination as that of her “alternative” family. The year after her college graduation, Sarah married a devout classmate, entering into a culture in which family life was pivotal. Six years later, Hannah started college, but for her the road to maturity was rough. She had diculty concentrating, earned uneven grades, and accumulated so many incompletes in courses that the university prohibited her from reenrolling until she wrapped up her “unﬁnished business.” Frustrated with Hannah’s undirectedness, her mother withdrew ﬁnancial support and insisted that she get a job. Hannah’s full-time waitressing soon became both an obstacle and an excuse for lack of progress in her studies. “I was at sea,” Hannah recalled. “I didn’t have any conﬁdence in myself, and I didn’t think I could do anything. So I started visiting Aunt Eva and Uncle Charlie, who lived three hours away.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch2.txt
The Psychoanalytic View: Wish Fulfillment and Insight into Social Roles<n>Freud regarded make-believe play as a form of pleasurable wish fulﬁllment that allows children to act out uncertainties, anxieties, and hoped for outcomes and, therefore, to master frightening and frustrating events. Young children, Freud noted, often revisit anxiety-provoking experiences, such as a trip to the doctor’s office or discipline by a parent, but with roles reversed so the child is in command and compensates for unpleasant happenings. Sophie’s parents, aware of the previous day’s events, might have judged her pretend focus on bedtime, lollipops, and paciﬁers to contain at least an element of wish fulﬁllment. The evening before, they had told her, “Only one lolly from the candy dish,” and she had complained at having to go to bed while her parents continued to talk and laugh with their guests.<n>Psychoanalyst Erik Erikson built on Freud’s vision, expanding his picture of make-believe. According to Erikson, children draw on fantasy play to ﬁnd out about themselves and their social world.1 In all cultures, children act out family roles and highly visible occupations—police officer, doctor, and nurse in our society; rabbit hunter and potter among the Hopi Indians; and hut builder and spear maker among the Baka of West Africa.2 As they do so, they enter a small social organization whose members must cooperate to achieve common goals. And through observing and emulating admired adult ﬁgures, preschoolers internalize social norms and gain a sense of their future, of what they can become and how they can contribute to society.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Had Vygotsky lived long enough to become familiar with Erik Erikson’s psychoanalytic theory, he would have agreed that make-believe play teaches children about social roles and provides them with insights into what they can become in their society. But Vygotsky was far more explicit about just how pretending helps children acquire dispositions that foster eager, willing participation in social life.<n>Children’s imaginative play, Vygotsky pointed out, contains an interesting paradox. In play, preschoolers seem to do what they most feel like doing, and to an outside observer, their play appears free and spontaneous. Nevertheless, pretend play demands that children act against their immediate impulses because they must subject themselves to the rules of the make-believe scene.13 A child pretending to go to sleep follows the rules of bedtime behavior. Another child imagining herself to be a mother and a doll to be a baby conforms to the rules of parental behavior. And a child playing astronaut obeys the rules of shuttle launch and space walk.<n>In this sense, make-believe is not really “free play,” as we often assume it to be. Instead, its very essence is self-restraint—voluntarily following social rules. While pretending, Vygotsky explained, children repeatedly face conﬂicts between the rules of the make-believe situation and what they would do if they could act impulsively, and they usually decide in favor of the rules. When tired, Sophie’s teddy bear and leprechaun don’t stay up late doing just as they please. Instead, they obey their caregivers and go to bed. With only one lollipop, or paciﬁer, to go around, teddy bear and leprechaun share. They don’t quarrel and grab, and if they had done so, Sophie or another make-believe character probably would have intervened and insisted on kind, considerate behavior.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt

During fantasy play, however, renouncing impulse and following social rules are central to the fun of playing. Rather than frustrating or disappointing the child, self-restraint is the route to maximum pleasure.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt

Rather than frustrating or disappointing the child, self-restraint is the route to maximum pleasure.<n>In sum, subordinating immediate desires to the rules of make-believe scenes becomes a new form of desire15—one that responds to the child’s need to become an accepted member of his or her culture. Indeed, if you watch preschoolers at play, you will see that they rarely violate the rules of their social world. And as they jointly create play scripts and follow social rules with peers, they come to appreciate society’s norms and strive to uphold them. A child playing storekeeper experiences ﬁrsthand the reasons for having customers line up to pay, for making change accurately, and for being polite. A child playing parent in a household scene becomes aware of parental responsibilities and why it’s important for children to follow their parents’ directives.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Furthermore, children acting out stories during pretend play are assisted in mastering the storytelling script, or basic framework of story organization. Preschoolers’ pretend scenarios are often quite storylike, consisting of characters, settings, and plot sequences that include adventure, suspense, surprise, conﬂict, and resolution. Witness the following trip to Sea World, during which Emily and her friends save Baby Shamu from danger:<n>S: (to Emily) Would you come with us? Let’s go to Sea World.<n>E: Sea World! Let’s watch Shamu! I’m the mom. (All three children run to one end of the room and sit down next to one another. They gaze toward the other end of the room.)<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Vital Features of Adult–Child Play<n>How should parents, caregivers, and teachers go about engaging young children in make-believe? Effective scaffolding of play is somewhat different from scaffolding of nonplay tasks. In fostering play, adults might have explicit goals, such as teaching culturally valued knowledge and skills and promoting self-regulation and imagination. But directiveness and didactic teaching are seldom, if ever, necessary.<n>As play theorist Brian Sutton-Smith pointed out more than a quarter-century ago, make-believe enables children who are still acquiring language to represent their everyday lives and inner thoughts and feelings more completely than is possible through any other symbolic means. This conﬁrms Vygotsky’s statement that “in play, the child always behaves beyond his average age, above his daily behavior.” Look back at the vignettes described in this chapter—of Sophie giving a sleepy teddy bear a paciﬁer, of Alison recalling the train crash in India, of Emily traveling to Sea World, and of Traci role-playing a mother getting sick and dying—and note how difficult it would be for 2- to 4-year-olds to construct such well-articulated ideas only in words or in their drawings. Consequently, adults do not need to “tutor” preschoolers in pretending, as they sometimes do when helping them master puzzles or other similar tasks.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
Instead, adult participation in make-believe works best when it responds to, guides, and builds on the child’s behaviors with demonstrations and suggestions. In support of this approach, psychologist Barbara Fiese’s observations of mothers playing with their 15- to 24-month-olds revealed that maternal questions, directions, and intrusions (initiating a new activity unrelated to the child’s current play) led to immature behavior in which toddlers merely mouthed, touched, and looked at toys. Relentlessly barraging children with information that communicates “at” rather than “with” them fails to involve them in dialogue and interferes with optimum development of play. In contrast, turn-taking and joint involvement, in which mothers sustained or expanded on their child’s play themes, evoked high levels of pretending.68<n>Maternal interactions that suggest play options related to 1 1/2-year-olds’ ongoing activity—for example, saying “Oh, is the doll trying to swim?” as the child puts a doll into a toy cup—continue to predict extended make-believe sequences and imaginative object substitutions at age 3. In contrast, toddlers whose mothers negate and correct—“No, dolls don’t go in cups, they go in the doll house”—tend to become 3-year-olds who spend much time in simple, immature manipulation of toys.69<n>Finally, the shared understanding underlying any type of adult–child communication that creates the “zone” is also essential in make-believe. Sensitive and mutually rewarding interaction between mother and baby in the ﬁrst year of life predicts complexity of mother–child pretending and children’s use of mental-state words during play at age 2.70 Parental behaviors that assist infants in “connecting” socially and becoming effective conversationalists seem to enhance their play competence and ability to talk about others’ thoughts and feelings later on. In sum, quality of adult–child social engagement, both within and outside of make-believe play, has much to do with the potential of such play to lead children’s development forward.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_CH4.txt
This does not mean that parents should never express anger at or punish a child. An otherwise warm parent who is disappointed and disapproving lets the child know that the transgression is serious. When children realize that adults regard their misdeed as very important, they listen more closely.20 And punishment is warranted after repeated infractions.<n>But parents have far better ways to punish than spanking. One of these is time out—requiring a child to sit aside or to go to his or her room. Another is withdrawal of privileges, such as a visit to the playground or a weekly allowance. These mild punishments derive their potency from warm parent–child bonds. Children of involved, caring parents ﬁnd the interruption in parental affection that accompanies punishment to be very unpleasant. As a result, they want to regain the warmth and approval of the parent as quickly as possible.<n>An important preventive of misbehavior—and a vital element of effective punishment—is explanation. Pairing reasons with mild punishment (such as time out) leads to a far greater reduction in rule violations than using punishment alone.21 The reason the adult gives the child must match the child’s capacity to understand. At ages 2 to 3, referring to simple, direct outcomes works best, as in, “If you keep pushing Tommy, he’ll fall down and cry.” By age 4, parents can give more complex and subtle explanations. For example, they can refer to others’ intentions (“Don’t yell at Jessica. She was only trying to help”), to others’ feelings (“He’s proud of his tower, and you knocked it down; now he’s very sad”), and to issues of rights and fairness (“That toy belongs to Rudy, so you must ask for a turn”).22<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
When children begin preschool or child care, they are more susceptible to otitis media because of close contact with other children. Therefore, frequent screening for the disease, followed by prompt medical intervention, is vital. Interestingly, verbally stimulating adult–child interaction and high-quality child care help reduce developmental problems associated with otitis media.44 When adults converse often with children and keep environmental noise to a minimum, children with persistent ear infections have more opportunities to hear and respond to spoken language.<n>I’m trying to decide whether to enroll my 5-year-old son in kindergarten or wait until next year. How can I tell if he’s ready for kindergarten? If he doesn’t do well in kindergarten, should he repeat it or go into a “transition” class?<n>Many parents struggle with the decision of whether to enroll their child in kindergarten once the child meets the age requirements. Most often, they consider delaying the start of school for boys, who as a group tend to lag behind girls in cognitive and social development. At the heart of parents’ concern is whether their child will be able to meet the academic and social demands of the kindergarten classroom.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
Is learning and development affected if the father becomes less involved or absent after a divorce?<n>Divorce is invariably painful for children, and learning and development can be affected—temporarily and long term.73 Preschool and young school-age children are often profoundly upset. Because they have great difficulty grasping the reasons for their parents’ divorce, they may blame themselves and take the marital breakup as a sign that they could be abandoned by both parents. As a result, they may cry and cling, refuse to go to school, and show a drop in enthusiasm for play and learning. Young children need extra affection and reassurance along with gentle reminders that their parents’ separation is permanent. Of all age groups, preschoolers are most likely to have trouble accepting the reality of divorce and to fantasize that their parents will get back together.74<n>Many school-age children and adolescents also react strongly to the end of their parents’ marriage, particularly when family conﬂict is high and parent involvement with children is low. Around the time of divorce and for up to several years after, children tend to be emotionally volatile, displaying both depression and demandingness, noncompliance, and aggression.75 Boys in mother-custody families seem to have the hardest time. Research reveals that before the marital breakup, many sons of divorcing couples were impulsive and deﬁant—traits that may have contributed to as well as been caused by their parents’ marital problems. Thus, boys often enter the period of family turmoil surrounding divorce with behavior problems and a reduced capacity to cope with stress.76 Custodial mothers tend to have difficulty handling sons on their own. Both boys and girls show declines in academic achievement during the aftermath of divorce, but school problems are greater for boys.77<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Berk_ch7.txt
El Abuelo (Grandfather)<n>An old-man figure called el abuelo (the grandfather) played the role of a bogeyman in Hispano folklore. In literature it is sometimes spelled aguelo, and some scholars speculate that it may be a borrowed word from the language of the Pueblo Indians. In Spanish it means “grandfather,” and has become synonymous with coco, cucui, and bogeyman. This folk character is more known in northern New Mexico than in other parts of the Southwest. He appeared at Christmastime to test and discipline children who did not know their catechism or prayers. He was a scary figure, dressed to terrify children with a black cape and a mask with large horns, and always carrying a whip. Children were terribly frightened because of his horrid appearance. Instead of a mask he sometimes had a tortilla plastered on his face, wore buffalo horns and a horsetail, and of course carried the whip. A few days before Christmas, he’d knock on the door of a home, give a bloodcurdling cry, crack his whip, and yell at the children, “Han sido buenos muchachos estos?” (Have these children been good?) The children would cringe and hide while the parents defended them. Then el abuelo would say, “Pues que recén y se acuestén” (Well, let them pray and go to bed). Sometimes he made the children dance Las Palomitas, loosely translated as “the little doves.” Espinosa describes this experience. “After making them pray, he makes them form a circle, and, taking each other’s hands, they dance around the room with him, singing,<n>Baila paloma de Juan turuntún (or durundún) [sic]<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt
Adivinanzas (Riddles)<n>Adivinanzas are riddles. Many Chicano children remember being entertained with riddles narrated by parents and grandparents. A riddle is an intellectual brainteaser, in Spanish called a quebracabeza; facts are framed in the form of a question in such a way that the respondent cannot possibly know the answer. An example in Spanish is, “Qué camina de cuatro patas por la mañana, dos patas en el medio día, y tres patas en la noche?” (What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night?) The answer is man, who as a child, in the “morning” of life, crawls on four legs; as an adult walks on two legs; and as an old man uses a cane for support, thus walking on three legs. Another example is a “true riddle,” which is a comparison of something to the unknown answer, and that something is described in the question. For example, “Tengo ojos y no miro; boca pero no hablo; qué soy?” (I have eyes and cannot see; a mouth, but cannot speak; What am I?) The answer is a photograph. Another type of riddle is the conundrum, where the answer is contained in the riddle itself, such as “Agua pasa por mi casa cate de mi corazon” (Water passes by my house pain of my heart). The answer is “agua-cate” (avocado). Or, “Lana sube, lana baja” (Wool goes up and wool goes down). The answer is “la navaja,” la-na-baja (the knife). Conundrums contain wordplay and in Chicano culture are sometimes bilingual, playing with words in both the Spanish and the English language. Another type of riddle is the riddling question, such as “Qué le dijo la luna al sol?” (What did the moon say to the sun?) The answer is “Eres tan grande y no te dejan salir de noche” (You are so big and yet are not allowed to go out at night).<n>Many Spanish riddles collected in the Southwest reflect in some way the characteristics of the Southwest, both linguistically and environmentally. Since the problem presented in a riddle is linguistically and culturally based on both the teller’s and the audience’s culture, they must all be members of the same community or group to comprehend the puzzle. Bilingual riddles, those narrated in both English and Spanish, are clearly a Chicano invention growing out of the bicultural experience. Riddles are fun and educational as well. It is usually children who enjoy telling and listening to riddles. Like other folklore genres, riddles serve a function, helping children learn to interpret facts and form an opinion. They use language, humor, and a verbal fun activity to challenge a child’s intellect.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chA.txt

A bony skeleton and/or the skull of a skeleton. The calavera has become the symbol of the downtrodden, who must laugh at life in order to survive it. It is also used to mean a drunkard or a very stupid person. During the celebrations of the holy day Día de los Muertos, candy skulls are made and sold in bakeries throughout Mexico and the United States. These skulls may be placed on home altars or given as gifts to children, family, and friends. The Mexican artist and printmaker Jose Guadalupe Posada started drawing calaveras during the late nineteenth century to coincide with this holiday. Their popularity is primarily attributed to him and his work. His images of calaveras have been reproduced thousands of times and can be found year-round, but especially during celebrations of Día de los Muertos. Posada printed many calaveras during the period of the presidency of Porfirio Díaz and during the Mexican Revolution. He introduced the humorous satirical calavera that showed the objectionable side of life, that engaged in regular daily activities such as eating, dancing, drinking, fighting, enjoying life, and being a regular Mexican. The Mexican concept of death is exemplified in the satiric antics of the calavera and this perspective is also found in the art, literature, and performance arts of Chicanos. Calaveras are depicted dancing, drinking in cantinas (bars), crowding and falling out of buses, and playing instruments in musical groups. El Teatro Campesino in its performances always has a calavera character that either represents La Muerte (death) or typifies a disturbing alter ego of one of the main characters.<n>A Mexican tradition of the late nineteenth century was the publication of a poetic broadside that was called a calavera. Published before or during the festivities of Día de los Muertos, these calaveras carried poems that poked fun at socially prominent people such as politicians and the very wealthy. Some calaveras, such as the poems, were printed in newspapers, but most were small pamphlets or single sheets that were sold on the street. For a small fee, people could hire a composer to write a calavera for them and draw a skeleton to go with it. According to Tinker, “their main functions are to remind us in a good-humored way that we all are mortal, and to poke fun at friends and attack public officials. These last are supposed to take it all in good grace. Calaveras are still published every November 1 in many cities of Mexico, and in some cities in Texas, notably San Antonio” (Tinker 1961, 20). The calavera is now an integral element of Mexican and Chicano folk art and it adorns murals, stationery, postcards, party invitations and decorations, and even religious art.<n>See also Día de los Muertos; La Muerte<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chC.txt

The prodigious amount of published literature about La Llorona, by folklorists, literary critics, anthropologists, and feminist writers, attests to the complexity of the legend. Children’s books, short stories, novels, and films have been created based on this basic story of infanticide and repentance. We find narratives in rural and urban areas of the Southwest, on college campuses, in juvenile halls, in large cities of the Midwest such as Chicago, and among the native populations of Mexico.<n>Many Chicanos see themselves as orphans of La Llorona, as the lost children of the marriage between the Aztecs and the Spanish Conquerors. She is a beloved female archetype among contemporary Chicanas, who write poems, short stories, and academic research articles about her. As one writer put it, “It is finally time to let go of a single, narrow understanding of the tale and to see La Llorona instead as an always evolving emblem of gender, sexuality, and power—and, too, as another female victim of history’s tender mercies” (Candelaria, 115).<n>See also Leyendas; La Malinche; La Muerte<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chL.txt
A translation of the word “wetback,” sometimes spelled moja’o, which literally simply means “wet.” It is a pejorative expression, although it is sometimes used by Mexican people to describe themselves and their experience of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to come to the United States. Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos, with the same prejudicial meaning as “greaser” or “spic.” Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants. Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called “wets.”<n>Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels. In Mexico, the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas, a literal translation for the word wetback. In 1955 a well--established Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas, which intended to persuade Mexicans not to go to the United States. It was a political film that incorporated all of the standard characters that would appear in countless other films and novels of the Chicano experience: the wetback, the pocho (half Mexican), the coyote (smuggler) who smuggles people into the United States, and the grower Mister Sterling. An ironic, yet justified ending shows Mister Sterling dumped into the Rio Grande by Mexicans, and as he swims to the U.S. side of the border he is shot by the Border Patrol. In a 1998 article Herrera-Sobek discusses the use of corridos in several Mexican films that depict the plight of the illegal immigrant, or el mojado.<n>References Cordova 1990; Herrera-Sobek 1993b, 1998; Madrid-Barela 1975; Mora 1982<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
Muralismo (Mural Art)<n>The artistic movement of painting murals in Chicano barrios. The development of Chicano Muralismo grew out of the political context of the Chicano civil rights movement, a nationalistic political struggle waged by Chicanos during the 1960s. It imitated the Mexican mural art that was created during the postrevolutionary period of Mexico’s history, and was intended to promote political action and raise consciousness. In California the mural movement started about 1970. It involved a variety of interested individuals; as described by Alicia Gonzales, “The emergent Chicano Mural Movement brought together the self-taught artist, the sign-painter, the house painter, the mass-production painter from the billboard companies, the college art student, and the graffiti artist” (155). A statewide meeting of Chicano mural artists was held in September of 1974 as a means of developing cooperation and communication for the artists working throughout California. The early murals were considered public folk art because of the common themes of community and civil rights and because most of the murals were located in working-class neighborhoods and urban barrios. Often, these early murals were referred to as a people’s art. This concept was well expressed by a group of women artists in San Francisco who called themselves Mujeres Muralistas (women muralists). “Our interest as artists is to put art close to where it needs to be. Close to the children; close to the old people; close to everyone who has to walk or ride the buses to get places. We want our art either out in the streets or in places where a lot of people go each day, the hospitals, health centers, clinics, restaurants, and other public places” (Cockcroft, Weber, and Cockcroft, 107).<n>The scenes of many early Chicano murals consisted of pre-Columbian indigenous themes and motifs that reflected a mestizo (mixed-race) heritage and a Mexican cultural nationalism. Images of Aztlán, a concept from the pre--Conquest, and other Aztec symbols represented cultural pride and national loyalty. Chicano and Chicana artists turned to symbols that portrayed the traditions of Chicanos, traditions that distinguished them from mainstream American culture. These images can still be found in murals located in Chicano communities across the United States. Chicano muralists followed the tradition of the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Clemente Orozco, and used murals to rewrite the history of the Chicano experience. Murals were also intended to educate the community on the antiquity and ancestry of the Mexicano. What was not provided in textbooks and the classroom was flashed across walls in Chicano neighborhoods. The Chicano muralists sought to paint the history they knew, a history often based on “oral traditions, legends and myths” (Romo, 136).<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
During the mid-1850s there were at least five men named Joaquín, all of whom are credited with committing robberies and banditry. There was Joaquín Murrieta, Joaquín Valenzuela, Joaquín Carrillo, Joaquín Ocomorena, and Joaquín Botilleras. Some say that Valenzuela and Ocomorena were one and the same, and when he was hanged, two Joaquíns were eliminated. Although it is possible that Murrieta used all of these names as aliases, it is likely that there were at least two Joaquíns at the time. Murrieta started his life of banditry and crime after his home was invaded by white miners, who raped his wife Rosa and beat up Joaquín. Later he and his brother Carlos were accused of stealing a horse, a crime for which Carlos was lynched and Joaquín flogged.<n>There have been over twenty-one published versions of the Joaquín Murrieta legend. The first and for many years the one considered most -authentic was by John Rollin Ridge, serialized in the California Police Gazette and eventually published under the title of The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murrieta, the Celebrated California Bandit in 1854. John Rollin Ridge, a Cherokee also known as Yellow Bird, wrote his story one year after the death of Murrieta. This is the basic story of Joaquín that all subsequent histories are based on. In 1859 the California Police Gazette printed Ridge’s story in ten installments and this publicity helped to further disseminate the story. The book was translated into French and Spanish and for many years it was better known abroad than in this country. In doubting the details of the Murrieta legend, researchers go back to Ridge’s version, which some say was based on newspaper stories about the various bandits named Joaquín. It is believed by some researchers that Ridge just applied the name Murrieta to the Joaquín that was finally captured and decapitated. As a Native American, Ridge identified with the discriminatory treatment of California Mexicans, and he stated that he wanted to do justice to the Mexicans.<n>Joaquín Murrieta’s life has been depicted in novels, stories, newspaper serials, and movies. Charles E. B. Howe wrote a play about Joaquín in 1859 that covers his escapades from the spring of 1851 to July 24, 1853, the day he was captured and killed by Captain Harry Love. It is not known if the play was ever performed, but the portrayal of Murrieta is moving and especially interesting because of all the negative publicity following his capture and death. Howe portrays him as an aristocratic intelligent leader and a man who commits crimes to avenge the wrongs committed against himself and his countrymen.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chM.txt
Oremos (Christmas House Visits)<n>A custom from New Mexico and parts of Texas, at least El Paso, where on Christmas Day children go from house to house asking for treats, much like on Halloween. This custom was sometimes just called Oremos (literally, “we pray”). Children would knock on the doors of their neighbors and chant:<n>Oremos, Oremos<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chO.txt
Doors and windows we will break.)<n>The chant states that they’re angels from heaven and are asking for gifts, although if they receive none, they may break doors and windows. The origin of this custom is not known, but some believe it is to remind society that the stranger at the door should not be forgotten. Lorin Brown reports that in northern New Mexico the children went out on Christmas Eve, but in Canutillo, Texas, around the 1920s, it was the custom for children to go door to door on Christmas Day, although they didn’t recite the above chant. The neighbors expected them and were ready with gifts of fruits and candies.<n>Lottie C. Devine makes reference to the Papago Indians in Arizona, saying that on “Christmas Day most of them came to town, all dressed in party clothes, and went from house to house ‘calling Christmas.’ Everyone gave them candies and apples and many of them in turn gave baskets or pottery” (29). Cabeza de Baca refers to this custom as aguinaldos, and the chant she records is similar to the one above, except that the last line is “A pedir Aguinaldos y Oremos.” Aguinaldos are gifts given during the Christmas season.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chO.txt
Oso, Juan<n>The name of a folk character found in tales collected in Spain and New Mexico by Aurelio Espinosa and his son, Jose Manuel Espinosa. In some tales Juan Oso (John Bear) is the son of a princess and a bear. The princess is kidnapped by a bear when she is out of the palace and is taken to a cave where she eventually has a son who is half bear and half human. Finally she and Juan Osito, her son, are able to run away from the bear and go live in the palace with her father. After Juan grows up he leaves his mother to wander the land, and from this point on, various tales describe the different adventures of Juan Oso. In a variant of the tale, a young woman and her baby son are captured by a bear and taken to live in a cave where the son grows up learning the ways of the bear. They also escape and return to live with the woman’s uncle, and Juan Oso wanders off to explore the world. Even though he is half wild, Juan Oso develops into a strong, smart, and sensitive man who will not be outwitted. In variants collected by Elaine Miller in Los Angeles, where he is called Juan del Oso, he has magical abilities. After he saves three princesses he is usually allowed to marry one of them.<n>References Espinosa, A. M., 1985; Espinosa, J. M., 1937; Miller 1973<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chO.txt
Los Pastores (Shepherds’ Play)<n>A religious medieval nativity folk play. Also known as La Pastorela, the complete title of this folk drama is El Coloquio de los Pastores, and it is written in verse and performed on Christmas Eve. It is an ancient mystery play, brought to the New World by the Spanish Franciscan priests, and is performed throughout the Southwest. As a folk production, it is performed for entertainment, but it is also a religious presentation that is maintaining a long tradition. The full title means “the dialogue of the shepherds,” and it is an interpretation of the dialogue and reaction the shepherds may have had when they learned of the birth of Jesus Christ. It narrates the story of the shepherds who are visited by Michael the Archangel who informs them of the birth of the infant Jesus and urges them to go to Belén (Bethlehem). Before the shepherds decide what to do, they are visited by Lucifer, who is angry about the birth of the Christ child to the Virgin Mary. Lucifer tries to challenge the shepherds but Michael the Archangel returns just in time to defeat him. The shepherds then continue on their journey to Bethlehem bringing gifts for the infant Jesus. The structure of the play is formulaic, and so the sequence of acts can be rearranged into many different patterns, with jokes, songs, speeches, and other events added at different points. The underlying story of the drama is the universal battle between good and evil. It has evolved from the literature of sixteenth-century Spain and the indigenous traditions of Mexico, and for this reason the play has provided a political format for the poor masses throughout the last 400 years.<n>Because of its ancient history there are many variants of Los Pastores, and several versions have developed a comic dialogue between Lucifer and Cucharón, Bartolo, and the other characters. One character is named Bato, as in bato loco (crazy guy), a phrase of contemporary usage among Chicanos today. Variants of this play have been collected in Texas, New Mexico, and California, and it has been performed in Mexico since the sixteenth century. In San Antonio the performance of Los Pastores at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church as been ongoing since 1913. Richard Flores, both as an ethnographer and as a performer, presents a thorough analysis of the historical conditions that continue to provide an environment for the performance of Los Pastores as both ritual and drama. In 1991 El Teatro Campesino produced a video film of their production of Los Pastores titled La Pastorela—The Shepherds’ Tale.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chP.txt
Quetzalcoatl<n>A god, one of the major deities of the Aztecs. Quetzal is a Nahuatl word referring to a bird found in Central America, and coatl means “snake,” so Quetzalcoatl means a “feathered serpent,” and this god is often called the Plumed Serpent. Stories about him indicate that he was an earthly hero, a light-skinned man, who acted as the ruler of the Toltecs for some time. In one legend Quetzalcoatl is sent to the underground to get the bones of the ancients. After the end of the Fourth Sun (an Aztec era), when the ancient people have been drowned or changed into fish, the spirits decide he should go seek the bones in order to start a new race. He must try three times, overcoming many obstacles, before he succeeds in bringing the bones to the sky. They are ground to a powder and placed in a bowl by the goddess Cihuacoatl. The other gods shed blood into the bowl and humans are born. Quetzalcoatl discovered corn, which he brought for the new humans to eat. He saw an ant bringing a kernel of corn from inside a mountain, and he changed himself into an ant and followed it. Lightning was used to split open the mountain to bring the corn to the people. He left the Toltecs to return to his home. It just happened that Quetzalcoatl promised to return in the same year that Hernán Cortés landed in Veracruz. It was to the Spaniards’ advantage to use the Indians’ belief in Quetzalcoatl’s return. Cortés was well received because he was thought to be Quetzalcoatl and the conquest of the Aztecs by the Spaniards was legitimized.<n>Quetzalcoatl is one of the better-known Aztec gods and has been greatly idealized by the moderns, including Chicanos. His image has influenced artists, writers, philosophers, and painters for hundreds of years. As the celestial dragon, he is patterned after the rattlesnake, a common mythical creature in Mesoamerica. This dragon has come to symbolize the Chicanos’ early heritage and has been embraced by Chicanos, especially those coming of age in the 1970s. Quetzalcoatl can be found in the literature, murals, and graphic art reflecting Chicano culture and the Chicano movement of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1970 an American Indian and Chicano college was started in northern California with the name Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl College. This college was still in existence in the year 2000 and has struggled to maintain a curriculum that meets the needs of both Indian and Chicano students. Deganawidah was the name of the chief of the Iroquois Federation, and after the college was given his name, it was learned there was a common belief that the name could not be mentioned publicly. Since that time the college has become known as D-Q University.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chQ.txt
La Virgen de Guadalupe<n>Also commonly known as Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, she is the Virgin Mary who appeared to Juan Diego, a Mexican Christian Indian, on December 9, 1531. Historical documents verify the story of her apparitions. She identified herself as the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, and speaking in Nahuatl, she asked Juan Diego to go to the Spanish bishop and ask that a temple be built there where she appeared, the mount of Tepeyac. To Juan Diego she was a beautiful woman who spoke his language, so after much difficulty he sought to speak to the bishop, but his story was not heard, and he was asked to return another day. The beautiful woman appeared to Juan Diego a second time, and he was asked to seek the bishop’s audience again. On the second try Juan Diego saw the bishop, his story was heard and questioned, but was not believed. The bishop wanted a sign from the Great Lady so that he would know it was really she who was sending Juan Diego. Diego intended to go back to Tepeyac and inform the beautiful woman, but when he returned home he found that his uncle Juan Bernardino was extremely ill. The next morning, on December 12, as he walked to Tlatelolco to call a priest to come to his uncle’s side, the beautiful woman came to him a third time asking what was wrong. Diego told her of his sick uncle and of the request from the bishop. She told him his uncle was now well and would not die and sent him to the top of a hill to cut fresh flowers that he was to take to the bishop as proof of her existence. Diego followed her instructions and at the top of the hill he found beautiful roses of Castile, still covered with dew. He cut them and The Lady, the Mother of God, arranged them in his tilma (cloak) and sent him to the bishop, with the proof requested. When Diego unfolded his tilma in front of the bishop, the roses fell to the floor, and there on the tilma was an image of the Virgin Mary. Now the Spanish bishop believed, and as the beautiful woman requested, a church was built right on the mount of Tepeyac. The tilma with the image of the Virgin Mary still hangs in the temple called Guadalupe. The name that the beautiful Lady gave herself was Tlecuauhtlacupeuh, but to the Spaniards it sounded like Guadalupe, which they instantly recognized as “Our Lady of Guadalupe” from Estremadura, Spain. But the Aztecs understood that in the Nahuatl language the name Tlecuauhtlacupeuh meant “la que viene volando de la luz como el águila de fuego” (she who comes flying from the region of light like an eagle of fire).<n>Tonantzin was an Aztec goddess, literally called Our Holy Mother, also known as Tonan. Guadalupe appeared at what was once the temple of Tonantzin at the mount of Tepeyac. Even today in Mexico, La Virgen María is often called Tonantzin. The acceptance of La Virgen de Guadalupe by the indigenous population of Mexico was the beginning of Mexican Christianity and the conversion of the Aztecs to Catholicism. Guadalupe became the symbol of Indian Catholicism, different from the European Catholicism of the Spaniards. As the Aztecs adapted the Catholic religion to their indigenous beliefs, they created a religion that met their own needs and own way of life. She was declared the “Patroness of the Mexican Nation” in 1737, and in 1754 Pope Benedict XIV canonized Guadalupe as an official saint. She was crowned “Queen of Mexico” in 1895, showing how strong a symbol of Mexican nationalism she had become. Today she continues as the country’s strongest symbol of Mexican identity. The cathedral built in her honor can no longer be used because of structural damage, but a new one was built in the early 1970s. Masses are held every hour of the day and the church is constantly filled to capacity.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Castro_chV.txt
Lochner ranks among the more widely scorned decisions of the Supreme Court. The general complaint is that the Court ignored the interest of the state in furthering the health and welfare of its citizens. To put this objection in other terms, the opinion ignored the ascendancy of the tripartite conception of government. The issue remains with us—if only in a slightly different guise. Since the late 1930s, the principle of freedom of contract has given way to the propriety of the state and federal measures to protect working people on the job. Yet, the question of liberty and its potential abuse in an oppressive relationship remains a flash point of debate. Although the concept is not mentioned in the Constitution, the freedom to say “yes” or “no” to particular commercial relationships has become an essential dimension of personhood. It is as much a part of the basic liberty protected under the due process clause as the right to be free from unjustified physical restraint.<n>Freedom of contract enables individuals to express their personhood, but it also facilitates relationships of oppression, including “slavery and involuntary servitude.” After all, it is possible to choose to enter into a contract of slavery. The book of Exodus permits the purchase of a Hebrew slave, but after six years of service “he shall go out free, for nothing.”10 Yet, there are people, the Bible recognizes, who prefer the condition of servitude:<n>And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master . . . I will not go out free, then his master shall bring him . . . to the door or to the door post, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl and he shall serve him Forever.11<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt

We know from the fate of many long-term prisoners that after a certain period they choose a life of dependence, free of the responsibility of caring for themselves. It is not impossible that someone might actually prefer the secure life of the slave to the anxious life of the free person who must care for himself.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt

We know from the fate of many long-term prisoners that after a certain period they choose a life of dependence, free of the responsibility of caring for themselves. It is not impossible that someone might actually prefer the secure life of the slave to the anxious life of the free person who must care for himself.<n>There are two distinct grounds on which the law might sensibly prohibit the possibility recognized in Exodus. First, the claim might be that freedom and its blessings represent a great gift that no individual “made in God’s image” should be able to forfeit as though it were a disposable piece of property. Alternatively, the argument might be that in principle people have the right to choose to forego their freedom, but that in reality these choices are always influenced by personal necessities that becloud the choice actually made. This is especially true under market conditions, where the need for sustenance can drive people into relationships that they would not choose in and of themselves. It is clear that even the choice of the Hebrew slave discussed in Exodus can never be shown to be completely free. The legal arrangements also stipulate in the same passage that if during his period of servitude the slave acquired a wife or children, then he must leave them behind when he leaves his master’s service. Some purchased servants might decide to opt for permanent servitude simply because they cannot bear to live without their wives and family. The full text in the quoted passage reads: “I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out free.”12 The cruelty of subjecting him to the choice between freedom and leaving his family obviously means that his choice is not free in any meaningful sense.<n>Under modern capitalism there are many conditions that render choices less than fully free. Material necessity is the most obvious. But, as we have learned from the history of alcohol and cigarette consumption, advertising and peer group influence can lead people to develop habits that they later regret. The same is true of heroin consumption, which may readily develop into a condition of dependency in which the addict may enjoy the illusion of freely choosing not a hole bored in his ear but rather numerous telltale holes bored in his veins.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt
The first Constitution plays on the theme of distrust in government. We must secure our freedoms against potentially abusive officials seeking “rents” by pursuing their own bureaucratic interests.22 The second constitution presupposes trust in an aggressive government, a watchdog of transactions that might slide into the forbidden territory of “involuntary servitude.” In this regard, public opinion seems to be at odds with the de facto tolerance of Americans for governmental action that is becoming ever more intrusive. The public supposedly suffers from declining trust in government.23 Yet, in fact, the average person tolerates actions by government that can make sense only on the assumption that those potentially affected by governmental abuse see Washington officials as their allies in a common struggle. A good example is the census and the popular reaction. The census form for the year 2000, like several before it, poses probing questions about racial and ethnic identity. The government wants to know how many blacks and other minorities live in particular sections of the country. The questionnaire imposes a detailed grid of racial variations on people who might otherwise simply have thought of themselves as Americans or perhaps as “minorities.” This information becomes relevant, it is said, to Justice Department officials monitoring the distribution of voting power in congressional districts.24<n>Americans would not cooperate in answering these questions if they did not trust the government not to misuse the collected information. There was a time when the government sought indirectly to find out how many Jews still spoke Yiddish at home. One can be sure that the purposes of early twentieth-century officials, ever concerned about swelling immigration patterns, were not benign. And yet, today the common assumption is that our officials may be trusted with a precise racial and ethnic map of the American nation. Popular attitudes even go beyond tolerance for the intrusion into our personal identities. Many people of multiracial backgrounds prefer to identify themselves as “black,” on the theory that it enhances the interests of the African- American population to appear as numerous as possible.25 For the government to serve as the vanguard of a new constitutional order, the people must trust officials in Washington with additional powers and run the risk of governmental abuse.<n>This trust makes sense—despite the surveys in which people report distrust—on the assumption that the nation chooses to cooperate in the ascendancy of the government as the watchdog of equality and popular democracy. The breach of equal treatment need not be feared, and information on the distribution of potential voting blocks serves the cause of securing fair representation of all major groups in American society.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch10.txt
Lincoln’s posture toward the 1787 Constitution was less than reverent. He treated the founding charter of the government more as a guideline to action than as a set of absolute restrictions on his actions. His decisions, particularly in the early stages of the war, suggest a willingness to assert extraconstitutional executive power and, thus, to permit the exigencies of war to restructure the government. In April 1861, in the immediate shadow of the shelling of Fort Sumter, he declared a blockade on Southern ports. Whether the Union forces could properly seize ships without congressional approval became one of the early legal controversies of the war.2 And then came the dispute about Lincoln’s authorizing his generals in the field to suspend the writ of habeas corpus—the great writ by which the courts retain the power to supervise the arrest and detention of criminal suspects. The Constitution permits suspension of this protection in times of civil unrest—but fails to specify whether the president may act unilaterally in ordering suspension. Sitting alone as a circuit judge, Chief Justice Taney interpreted the constitutional provision to require congressional authorization for suspending the writ.3 In light of Taney’s notorious opinion in the Dred Scott case,4 his views hardly carried much weight in the White House. In a move widely regarded as authoritarian, Lincoln simply disregarded Taney’s opinion. Lincoln justified his unilateral action with a famous claim of necessity, articulated in a message to Congress on July 4, 1861:<n>The whole of the laws which were required to be faithfully executed were being resisted . . . in nearly one third of the States. Must they be allowed to finally fail of execution, even had it been perfectly clear that by the use of the means necessary to their execution some single law, made in such extreme tenderness of the citizen’s liberty that, practically, it relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent, should to a very limited extent be violated? . . . Are all the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated?5<n>Read with our current sensitivity to civil liberties, these are embarrassing words. Lincoln argues, in effect, that he can justify violating a constitutional prescription by appealing to the necessity of the moment. Of course, if the stark option were posed—violating this “one law” or letting the government “go to pieces”—most of us would agree that the government should survive the emergency, even by transgressing the Constitution. Yet, there is no evidence that the country’s circumstances were anywhere near this flashpoint of imminent destruction. And Lincoln’s casual disdain for the writ of habeas corpus (“it relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent”) reveals a lack of appreciation for the point of constitutional protections in criminal procedure. My own reading is that Lincoln’s suspending the writ on his own initiative and disregarding Taney’s supposed invalidation of the decision testifies to an altered state of constitutional thinking. The Constitution of 1787 lay suspended in the fires of battle. A new constitutional order would arise from the war, but no one quite knew what shape it would take.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt
This process of unifying the European nations and, at the same time, establishing a state to govern the nation had given us the idea of the nation-state. The nation as a prepolitical reality finds its embodiment in the apparatus of state power. The traditional view is that the United States was different, that Americans were not a nation in the European sense. I beg to differ.<n>My claim is that Lincoln’s address expresses the same idea that was then current in Europe. Each people of common history and language constitutes a nation, and the natural form for the nation’s survival was in a state structure. The idea that Americans constituted an organic national unit explained, implicitly, why the eleven Southern states could not go their own way. As he assumed the presidency, Lincoln still spoke of the Union rather than a nation; but in the course of the debates in the decades immediately preceding, the notion of union had acquired the metaphysical qualities of nationhood. In his first inaugural address, Lincoln invoked the “bonds of affection,” and even before shots were fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, he stressed the unbreakable ties of historical struggle:<n>The mystical chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grate, to every living heart and hearth-stone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union. . . .<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch2.txt
Equality appears as a central theme in the virtue of justice as well as friendship. The just person is one who pays due regard to his own interests as well as to those of others. He is able to maintain the proper balance between his own interests and those of others. This is an aspect of distributive justice that generally requires each person to receive a due or proportionate share of the good to be distributed. Aristotle describes this proportion as an expression of geometric equality. Similarly, when one person wrongs another, some correction is necessary. This species of justice is also based on equality, understood arithmetically. The wrongdoer and the victim should both be restored to the state they were in prior to the wrong. This might be done by compelling the wrongdoer to pay compensation from the gains that he has received in order to make up the loss to the victim.<n>These virtues of friendship and justice require cultivation, for they contribute to the flourishing of the virtuous individual. Adapted to the nationalist argument for equality among all Americans, Aristotle’s argument about friendship would go something like this: we should treat all members of the American polity as equal, with equal concern for their lives, precisely as we would treat friends. By so doing, we as a nation will flourish and we as individuals will flourish from our taking the ends of our compatriots as seriously as we would those of friends.<n>Each nation must seek equality for the sake of its own flourishing. The sense of common destiny is nowhere better expressed than in the Jewish expression: Kol Jehudim eruvim ze bze [All Jews are responsible for each other]. In the rhetoric of American nationalism, the metaphor of the chosen people, of the substitution of Americans for Jews, recurs as a familiar trope. The sense of organic closeness is implied. The responsibility of the American nation should run to all members of the nation, defined in the Fourteenth Amendment as all those naturalized or born on the soil of the United States and subject to its legal jurisdiction.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt
The idea of human dignity, which we now take to be a shared premise of Western civilization, became the backdrop for our current faith in human rights and crimes against humanity.<n>The Fourteenth Amendment is our placeholder in the evolution of egalitarian thinking. We know very little about how much equality the framers of the amendment intended to secure, and frankly it does not matter. Each generation must struggle to assay how far they are willing to go in the name of egalitarian justice or, by contrast, how far they wish to surrender to the surviving counter-values of hierarchy. In the aftermath of the Civil War it was clear, ironically, that black men were far ahead of white women in ascending the scale of egalitarian possibilities. Black men acquired, at least nominally, both the right to vote and the right to serve on juries. White women and black women alike would acquire neither until well into the twentieth century.<n>Some might argue that because the United States lagged in recognizing equal legal rights for women, the mood of 1863 would have been hostile to recognizing that women as well as men were equal in the sight of God.27 When Lincoln said, “All men are created equal,” therefore, he meant men—only males were equal in the sight of the Creator. This objection is easily countered. Lincoln explicitly invoked the figures of women in his discourse on human dignity. In 1857, in his speech attacking the Dred Scott decision, Lincoln explicitly refers to the dignity and inherent equality of black women:<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch5.txt
Field’s argument carried four votes. The other five members of the court recoiled at the thought that the states owed duties to a higher legal order called the United States. U.S. citizenship did not have the effect of leveling the distinction between local citizenship and being the citizen of another state. To read the Reconstruction Amendments in this way would “fetter and degrade the State governments by subjecting them to the control of Congress.”27 The primary issue, as understood by the majority, was whether the states would retain their own special authority over their own citizens, an authority that was expressed in the “police power” to legislate for the common good. The implication was that states could readjust private rights and obligations among their own citizens if doing so served the overall advantage of the state’s residents. Granting a special franchise to the Crescent City Slaughter-House Company was simply an illustration of a general authority to help some citizens and hurt others—all within the state. What no state could do, however, was to seek to promote the interests of its citizens over the citizens of other states.<n>This, we should note, carried forth the struggle of the Civil War by other means. The special solicitude shown to “the relations of the State and Federal governments to each other and of both these governments to the people” harks back to the rhetoric of the 1830s about the asserted autonomy of the new states to decide whether they would go one way or the other on the issue of slavery. It is almost as though the Civil War had accomplished only one objective, namely settling the issue of secession, while doing nothing to define the nation of the United States or to establish a principle of equality among all its citizens.<n>Nonetheless, writing for the majority, Justice Miller constructed a plausible theory of what it should mean to be a citizen of the United States. The picture presented is something like the posture of a supplicant toward a distant protector. The citizen should be able to address representatives of the U.S. government in person, make claims against the higher power, and receive its protection as a citizen abroad or on the high seas. None of this is particularly radical, and it fails, to be sure, to incorporate the commitments to nationhood and equality bequeathed by the Civil War.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch6.txt
A more compassionate approach to victims’ rights became evident in the famous O. J. Simpson case, which held the country’s rapt attention for more than a year in 1996 and 1997. In the pretrial skirmishes, the defense objected to the families of the two victims, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, remaining in the courtroom if they might later be called as witnesses. Marcia Clark won the argument in the name of the Brown and Goldman families, actually with some help from a book I had just published on victims’ rights. Whether his words did the trick or not, the author could not help but enjoy hearing them enter into the deliberations. As Clark read them in the debate: “The minimal task of the criminal trial is to stand by victims, to restore their dignity, to find a way for them to think of themselves, once again, as men and women equal to all others.”10 Judge Ito made the right decision to let the families stay in court. If they were later called as witnesses, the defense could adequately protect itself by cross-examining the witnesses about testimony previously heard.<n>European courts are also wary of allowing potential witnesses to hear the testimony of other witnesses before they testify (they put less faith in cross-examination), but they take strong measures to protect the interests of victims at trial. The typical pattern is to allow the victim to join the proceedings either as a civil plaintiff suing simultaneously for tort damages or as a coprosecutor arguing and presenting the case alongside the state prosecutor. American reformers want to improve the position of the victim at trial, but none of them dares go so far as to suggest reforms comparable to accepted practice on the Continent.<n>The American movement favoring compassion for victims of crime has found expression in a variety of low-visibility measures. The constitutional amendment, sponsored by Senators Jon Kyl of Arizona and Diane Feinstein of California, sought to introduce the following rights:<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
Since the Civil War, the United States has hardly lacked a strong sense of national patriotism. But the state has had to do little to further it. In the 1890s, the Pledge of Allegiance, our secular prayer to the flag, spontaneously spread across the country and became a standard part of the socialization process for all American children. There was little national hesitation about our wars of national aggrandizement against militarily weak opponents in Cuba and Panama. And the country joined enthusiastically in sending our doughboys overseas, in President Wilson’s words, “to make the world safe for democracy.” The generation that fought and won World War II is still with us, infusing in both blacks and whites a strong sense of a national mission well executed. The war in Vietnam was undoubtedly a setback for the spirit of patriotism. A whole generation—my friends and students—became skeptical about the use of military power. Yet, to my surprise and somewhat to my chagrin,14 a new cohort took up the sentiments of their grandparents and enthusiastically supported the questionable goals of the government in the Gulf War. As we were bombing Iraq, the country erupted again in a spontaneous display of unity and patriotic enthusiasm. Yellow ribbons appeared everywhere. It reminded one of the pledge that burst out a hundred years earlier, a paean to the flag in school houses around the country.<n>Civil society is a powerful medium, and when the public takes up the cause either of religion or of patriotism, its strength overshadows the feeble efforts of government to manipulate its opinions. Yet, in both fields—religion and patriotism—we face a constant challenge from those who are unsatisfied with the successes of civil society. They want government to join the action. Nowhere is this more evident than in the politics of schooling. We worry constantly, perhaps with good reason, that the young in America are growing up with the wrong values. They supposedly suffer from all the mistakes of their elders who promote violence on television and have permitted the country to be flooded with guns, which, as everyone knows, enable teenagers who go on rampages to gain a few hours of prime time news coverage. One wonders, however, whether it is an effective response for government to require, as suggested in one Republican initiative, schools to post the Ten Commandments on schoolhouse walls. This drive toward governmental intervention in the field of value formation has been nowhere more evident—and questionable—than the recently revived push for a constitutional amendment to protect the flag against protestors who want to burn it.<n>The commitment to the flag has surely been one of the stable and recognized provisions of our sub rosa constitution. We do well to cultivate reverence toward the flag, which coupled with national rituals like the pledge, instills sentiments of national loyalty in our children. Although patriotic sentiments toward the flag antedate the Civil War, we begin to find, in the early twentieth century, a duty of reverence toward the Stars and Stripes formulated as a legal issue. In 1907, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction for flag desecration of a beer manufacturer who printed the flag on his cans. Appropriating the flag for commercial purposes was considered disrespectful.15<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Fletcher_ch9.txt
Bak and his friends called their sand pile “self-organized critical.” Here, “critical” means that avalanches occur on all length scales, “self-organized” means that the system tunes itself to this critical state.<n>Many of us have now explored the application of Bak’s ideas in models of coevolution that I will discuss shortly. With caveats that other explanations may account for the data, the general result is that something may occur that is like a theory of coevolutionary assembly that yields a self-organized critical biosphere with a power law distribution of small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events. As we shall see, the best data now suggest that precisely such a power law distribution of extinction and speciation events has occurred over the past 650 million years of the Phanerozoic. In addition, the same body of theory predicts that most species go extinct soon after their formation, while some live a long time. The predicted species lifetime distribution is a power law. So too are the data.<n>Similar phenomena may occur in an econosphere. Small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events occur in our technologies. A colleague, Brian Arthur, is fond of pointing out that when the car came in, the horse, buggy, buggy whip, saddlery, smithy, and Pony Express went out of business. The car paved the way for an oil and gas industry, paved roads, motels, fast-food restaurants, and suburbia. The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote about this kind of turbulence in capitalist economies. These Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction appear to occur in small and large avalanches. Perhaps the avalanches arise in power laws. And, like species, most firms die young; some make it to old age = Storre, in Sweden, is over nine hundred years old. The distribution of firm lifetimes is again a power law.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch1.txt
There is no finitely prespecifiable list of statements about ordinary human actions whose truth would be necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement that the jury found Henderson guilty of murder.<n>Another example concerns the United Kingdom going to war with Germany. There is no finitely prespecifiable set of ways this must happen. Thus, the queen, one day after tea, might betake herself to Parliament and cry, “We are at war with Germany!” Or the prime minister might in Parliament say, “Members, by the authority of my oYce I declare that we are at war with Germany!” Or ten thousand irate football fans from Leeds might shoulder picks, take to barges, funnel in fury up the Rhine, and attack football fans in Koblenz. Or   .   .   .   . In short, there is no prestatable set of necessary and suYcient conditions about the actions of individual humans for the United Kingdom to manage to go to war with Germany. (And may neither nation again find a way to make war on the other in the future.)<n>Wittgenstein’s point is that one cannot, in general, reduce statements at a higher level to a finitely specified set of necessary and suYcient statements at a lower level. Instead, the concepts at the higher level are codefined. We understand “guilty of murder” within the legal language game and thus in terms of a codefining cluster of concepts concerning the features noted above = law, legal responsibility, evidence, trial, jury.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Figure 3.1 shows the essentials of Carnot’s idealized machine. There are two heat reservoirs, one hotter than the other, T1 > T2. Between the two heat reservoirs is a cylinder with a piston inside. The space between the top of the piston and the head of the cylinder is filled with an idealized “working gas,” which can be compressed and can expand. As a real, and certainly an idealized, gas is compressed, the gas becomes hotter; as the gas expands, it becomes cooler.<n>I will modify the Carnot machine in one central way, which does not alter but rather makes explicit an important feature of the actual working of the Carnot machine. I will attach a red handle to the cylinder, as shown in Figure 3.1. The Carnot cycle begins with the piston pressed up near the top of the cylinder, the working gas is compressed and hot, indeed, it is as hot as the high temperature T1. You will operate the machine. You pull on the red handle, sliding the cylinder (frictionlessly) into contact with the high-temperature reservoir, T1. You then let go of the red handle and allow the working gas in the cylinder to expand, thereby pushing the piston downward away from the head of the cylinder, in the first part of the power stroke of the Carnot engine.<n>As the power stroke initiates, the working gas expands and starts to cool. However, thanks to the fact that the cylinder is now in contact with the hot thermal reservoir, heat flows into the cylinder from T1 and maintains the working gas almost at the constant temperature T1. Indeed, if the Carnot engine is operated slowly enough, the temperature remains constant. Such slow operation is said to be reversible. If the engine is operated more rapidly, hence irreversibly, the temperature is held nearly constant during this part of the power stroke, thus this section of the power stroke is called the “isothermal expansion portion” of the Carnot work cycle.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
It is not only convenient but central to understanding a Carnot engine to plot the state of the system in a Cartesian coordinate system in which the x-axis corresponds to the volume of the working gas, while the y-axis corresponds to the pressure of the gas (Figure 3.2). The work cycle began with the piston near the top of the cylinder, the working gas hot and compressed. As the isothermal expansion phase of the power stroke happens, the pressure falls slightly, while the volume increases appreciably. The corresponding segment of the work cycle connects the starting position in Figure 3.2, position 1, to position 2 by a line segment representing the simultaneous values of volume and pressure during the isothermal expansion part of the power stroke.<n>You initiate the second part of the power stroke by pushing on the handle and moving the cylinder out of contact with the hot T1 reservoir to a position between the two heat reservoirs, touching neither. You immediately let go of the handle. The working gas continues to expand, pushing downward on the piston and moving it away from the head of the cylinder. However, because the cylinder is out of contact with T1 and the working gas is expanding, the working gas gets noticeably cooler, so pressure drops appreciably while volume increases slightly. This part of the power stroke is called “adiabatic expansion.” In Figure 3.2, the adiabatic expansion step carries the system from step 2 to step 3, the end of the power stroke, a point where the pressure is at the lowest point, and the volume of the working gas is at the highest point of the work cycle.<n>Now in order to return the Carnot engine to its initial state, 1 (in Figure 3.2), such that the working gas can again expand and do mechanical work on the piston, work must be done on the engine to bring the piston back up to its position near the head of the cylinder and to recompress and reheat the working gas so that its temperature and pressure values, or state, correspond to state 1. If the work done on the Carnot engine simply retraced the exact pathway from step 3 to step 2 to step 1, at least as much work would have to be done on the Carnot engine as the engine released in the power stroke in going from 1 to 2 to 3. If so, no net work would be carried out by the Carnot engine on the external world.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch3.txt
Thus, we are to think of records as recording “measurements” that identify the source(s) of energy in the measured system, which may then be tapped to do work. My example of the wind through the window in Maxwell’s two-chambered gas system is a case in point. We have good grounds from Zurek’s work to believe that the complexity of the record is related to the reduction in entropy of the measured system.<n>Notice some interesting features of records. First, a useless feature of a nonequilibrium system with respect to extraction of work may be recorded. Second, errors may be made in the record of a useful feature of a nonequilibrium system from which work can be extracted. Third, the record may go out of date, so that work can no longer be extracted by reference to the record. Fourth, the record may be erased and may be updated. All the above features arise in a coevolving microbial community. Indeed, all sorts of signaling pathways in cells record and report energy sources and coordinate cellular activities within and between cells in a community. Mutation, recombination, and selection are means to update the recording devices with respect to changing sources of energy, opportunity, and danger. Again we see that cells in a community have the embodied know-how to get on with making a living.<n>We are struggling with a circle of concepts involving work, constraint, constraint construction, propagating work, measurements, couplings, energy, records, matter, processes, events, information, and organization. It has been said by many that we do not understand the linking of matter, energy, and information. The circle above points at something we must trouble ourselves to understand, and I suspect that the triad of matter, energy, and information is insucient. Rather, the missing “something” concerns organization. While we have, it seems, adequate concepts of matter, energy, entropy, and information, we lack a coherent concept of organization, its emergence, and self-constructing propagation and self-elaboration.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch4.txt
Among other critical features of the action-and-doing language game is that, compared to a hypothetical “complete” physical description, the action-and-doing description picks out the relevant features with respect to the goals of the autonomous agent. Interestingly, once we are at Dennett’s level of Popperian creatures, which can have internal models of, and plans for, the future and can have their models die in their stead, we seem to have arrived at a level of organization in which action-and-goal talk becomes essential. Is there a finitely prestatable set of statements about physical events that is jointly necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement, “The cheetah is hunting the gazelle”? Like other eVorts, we will find suYcient conditions but be hard pressed to find jointly necessary and suYcient conditions.<n>The dictionary hints at where our reductionism ideas may go wrong: Every word in the dictionary is defined in terms of other words. How could it be otherwise? Concepts are defined in webs, somehow tacked onto the real world by ostensive definitions = definitions given by pointing to examples. We carve up the world in a variety of ways, Wittgenstein’s language games, that appear not to be reducible to one another in the strict sense of necessary and suYcient conditions. And this, in turn, underlies the question whether legal systems and human actions are parts of the furniture of the universe, somehow above or in addition to the locations and motions of atoms and fields.<n>Even at the level of basic physical theory, the same issues arise. For example, classical thermodynamics is a well-defined science in its own right. Ludwig Boltzmann, Willard Gibbs, and others struggled to invent statistical mechanics, based on Newtonian laws operating on a set of idealized particles in the 6N-dimensional phase space we have discussed. It is generally seen as a triumph that the classical thermodynamic concepts of temperature, pressure, and entropy were reduced to statistical features of idealized sets of gas particles: temperature becoming the average kinetic energy of the particles, pressure the momentum transferred to the walls of the vessel, and entropy a measure of the number of microstates per macrostate.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch6.txt
Something has obviously happened in the past . billion years. The biosphere has expanded, indeed, more or less persistently exploded, into the ever-expanding adjacent possible. The secular diversity of organic molecular species has increased, on average, over the past . billion years.<n>It is more than slightly interesting that this fact is clearly true, that it is rarely remarked upon, and that we have no particular theory for this expansion. Indeed, I note for future reference that the standing diversity of species in the biosphere has, on average, with noticeable crashes in large extinction events, increased over the past . billion years. And among us mere humans, the diversity of ways of making a living has increased dramatically over the past million years, the past hundred thousand years, and even over the past thousand years. If you wanted a rabbit for dinner thirty thousand years ago, you bloody well went out and caught a rabbit. Now most of us can go buy a rabbit dinner. Something again has happened. At the level of species and ways of making a living in the “econosphere,” the actual has expanded into a persistent adjacent possible.<n>We are all parts of the universe. So, in our little hunk of the universe, with the sun shining beatifically upon us, rather remarkable goings on have occurred. Indeed, the biosphere may be one of the most complex things in the universe.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
It is helpful to attempt to formalize the concept of the adjacent possible. I will do so using classical physics and the now familiar concept of a N-dimensional phase space. Recall that our particles in the liter box had three positional variables and three momenta, or velocity variables, hence, six numbers per particle. For an N particle system, this is the familiar N-dimensional phase space.<n>Let’s just go ahead and define the classical N-dimensional phase space for a region of real space, including the sphere centered on the Earth out to twice the orbit of the moon and containing the positions and momenta of all particles from the Earth out to twice the orbit of the moon. Physicists always assure us that this makes sense. As usual, we can break this classical N-dimensional phase space into a very large number of tiny “cells,” each also N-dimensional. At any moment, the Earth-centered N system, call it the “Earth system,” is in one of these tiny cells, or microstates. Over time, the Earth system  or a larger one including the entire solar system or our galaxy or the local cluster of galaxies  flows from microstate to microstate. By our arguments above and ignoring gravity  a grave mistake in itself  clearly our Earth system has and will flow nonergodically in this phase space for vastly long time periods.<n>Now, the total adjacent possible to the current microstate of our Earth system is just the total number of microstates that are adjacent to our current microstate. And that number is very large indeed, for it is on the order of N. Say there are particles in the Earth system, a very crude guess, then the total number of adjacent possible microstates is about raised to the to the st power. In short, in principle the next state of our chunk of the universe is drawn from among raised to the to the st power neighboring microstates.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
It is interesting that the same feature may occur in the economy as a whole. We hear of future shock. Roughly, what we fear is that the rate of technological change will overwhelm us. But will it? Or is there a self-regulating mechanism that gates our rate of entry into the technological adjacent possible?<n>The latter, I think. Consider this: Why does an innovation get itself introduced? Because someone thinks he or she can make money introducing that innovation. But if the person or firm making the innovation and introducing it to the global or village markets faced a product life cycle that was so very rapid that neither they nor others in the economy could absorb the innovations and make livings, the firms in question would go broke. We will only broach the technological adjacent possible at that rate at which we can make a living doing so. We gate our entry into the technological future.<n>Thus, it appears that the biosphere and the econosphere have endogenous mechanisms that gate the exploration of the adjacent possible such that, on average, such explorations do successfully find new ways of making a living, new natural and business games, at a rate that can be selected by natural selection, or its economic analogue of success or failure, at a rate that is sustainable. It is a further plausible hypothesis that the rate of exploration of the adjacent possible endogenously converges to the rate that is maximally sustainable.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch7.txt
Now, states is very very small compared to ,. The overwhelming order of the ordered regime, I believe, keeps cells from wandering all over their state spaces for eternities beyond eternities. In fact, it takes about one to ten minutes to turn a eukaryotic gene on or o, so it would take a cell from to , minutes, or from about . hours to about hours, to traverse its state cycle attractor. This is right in the biological ballpark. For example, the cell division cycle of dierent human cell types is in the range of to hours.<n>By contrast, in the chaotic regime state cycle lengths scale exponentially with the size of the network. The deepest one can go into the chaotic regime is to assign at random the successor state for each state. In that case, in general, each gene is a Boolean function of all N genes. In this case, the typical state cycle length is the square root of the number of states in the state space. For the human genome with , states, a typical state cycle length would be the square root, hence ,. Remember, it is only seconds since the big bang. State cycle attractors of lengths ,? Not in my body, thank you very much.<n>In the first two articles I wrote on the subject of random Boolean nets, as long ago as and , I plotted cell cycle lengths from organisms as diverse as bacteria, yeast, worms, plants, and simple and complex animals. These progressively more complex organisms have progressively more DNA per cell and more genes per cell. If the Boolean net theory is on the right track, and if cell cycles are a reasonable proxy for expected state cycle times as a function of the number of genes, then cell cycle time should scale as a square root function of the number of genes. This prediction is actually pretty much correct. Indeed, a plot of median cell cycle time versus total DNA per cell is a square root function from bacteria to human cells.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
Stuart and Mack did a surprising study with an astonishing and still poorly understood result. They made a pile of hypothetical critters in a computer, each governed by some plausible Lotka-Volterra equation whose parameters were drawn at random from some distribution. Then, with fond hopes, Stuart and Mack randomly chose species, one after another and tossed them into the computational equivalent of east Kansas. (“Kansas is a place for people who like subtlety,” my friend Wes Jackson once told a group of us visiting his Land Institute in Kansas in January. We observed subtly dierent shades of brown grass, trees, dirt, dust, hawks, mice, and agreed.)<n>What Stuart and Mack found was this: When the first few species were tossed into east Kansas in silico, they tested whether these few could coexist by running the corresponding Lotka-Volterra equations of all the species simultaneously to see if the hypothetical species all sustained abundances above zero. For example, the model community might go to a steady-state ratio of four species or might enter a limit cycle oscillation or some chaotic dynamics with a strange attractor that remains above zero for all species.<n>Dandy, the mock community was stable. They kept adding randomly chosen species. At first, it was easy to add new species, but it became progressively harder until no more species could be added. The deep mystery is, why? It is not a lack of food or energy. Furthermore, on the way to assembling the community, Stuart and Mack began to notice that as the community filled up, addition of one species could make one or more other species go locally extinct. They began to find evidence of power law distributions of such extinction events.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt

They began to find evidence of power law distributions of such extinction events.<n>Why? No one knows for sure, and Stuart has some wonderful ideas discussed in his fine book, The Balance of Nature. But I am going to move on to the recent ideas of Bruce Sawhill and Tim Keitt, which build on the work of physicist Scott Kirkpatrick. Scott is famous for coinventing the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model and hangs out at IBM being smart. Not long ago, he took up what is called the “Ksat” problem.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
The results are shown in Figure .. Indeed, landscape ruggedness does evolve to an intermediate ruggedness. During this evolution, the mean interval between extinction events increases dramatically, hence, the mean number of extinction events decreases. In this sense, all the creatures that remain become fitter due to the coevolutionary tuning of landscape ruggedness. In addition, when Godzilla’ replaces the hapless species that now goes extinct, its econeighbors find themselves interacting with Godzilla’ itself. They may not be as fit interacting with Godzilla’ as with the first species, hence, they too may be invaded and driven extinct in turn.<n>In short, avalanches of extinction events can propagate. Figure . shows that the distribution is a power law, with many small and few large extinction events. Moreover, once a new species comes into existence, say, Godzilla’, it may not fare well in its new niche, hence, may go extinct soon. But if it lasts in its niche, it may be well adapted, hence, resistant to being driven extinct. The results (Figure .a) are a power law distribution of species lifetimes.<n>Thus, this model shows an invisible hand in which natural selection, acting on individuals only, tunes landscape ruggedness. All players are, on average, fitter in the sense of surviving as species for much longer periods, yet the ecosystem appears self-organized critical with a power law distribution of extinction events. Species lifetime distributions are also power laws.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
I do not know the form of the law that governs this exploration. Perhaps it is locally self-organized critical in communities, multiplied by the number of eectively independent local communities in the biosphere. But I can make out a law in which the adjacent possible is invaded, such that diversity and coconstructed, coevolved complexity accumulate, on average, as fast as it can.<n>I can sense a fourth law of thermodynamics for self-constructing systems of autonomous agents. Biospheres enlarge their workspace, the diversity of what can happen next, the actual and adjacent possible, on average, as fast as they can. Clues include the fact, noted above, that for the adjacent possible of a N-dimensional phase space to increase as the biosphere’s trajectory travels among microstates, a secular increase in the symmetry splittings of microstate volumes must occur, such that dierent subvolumes go to dierent adjacent possible microstates. Eventually, such subvolumes hit the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. As I noted, organisms do touch that limit all over the place in the subtle distinctions that we make, turning genes on and o, smell sensors on and o, and eyes on and o, this way and that.<n>The whole of this chapter suggests that autonomous agents coevolve to be as capable as possible of making the most diverse discriminations and actions, take advantage of the most unexpected exaptations, coevolve as readily as possible to coconstruct the blossoming diversity that is, and remains, Darwin’s “tangled bank.” I sense a fourth law in which the workspace of the biosphere expands, on average, as fast as it can in this coconstructing biosphere.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch8.txt
For a single good, the problem is simple. But consider bread and butter. Since many of us like butter on our bread, the demand for butter depends not only on the price and hence the supply of butter, but also on the price of bread, hence on the supply of bread. And vice versa, the demand for bread depends upon the price of butter and hence on the supply of butter. For thousands of goods, where the demand for any one good depends upon the price of many goods and the supply of any one good depends upon the price of many goods, it is not so obvious that there is a price for each good such that all markets clear.<n>But worse, the supply or demand for bread today may be dierent than the supply or demand for bread tomorrow. And still worse, the supply or demand for bread tomorrow may depend on all sorts of odd contingent facts. For example, if severe cold kills the winter wheat next month, the supply of bread will drop; if a bumper crop of winter wheat comes available globally because of weather or suddenly improved irrigation and farming practices worldwide, the supply will go up.<n>Arrow and Debreu made brilliant steps. First, they consider a space of all possible dated and contingent goods. One of their examples of a “dated contingent good” is “ ton of wheat delivered in Chicago on May , , under the condition that the average rainfall in Nebraska for the six preceding months has been percent less than normal for the past fifty years and that the Boston Red Sox won the World Series the previous year.”<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
The bounded complexity issues would seem to apply to any coevolving autonomous agents that are able to make theories of one another and base actions on those theories. The tiger chasing the gazelle and the starfish predating the trilobite are, we suppose, Popperian creatures able to formulate hypotheses about their worlds that may sometimes die in their stead. Presumably all such autonomous agents, under persistent mutation and selection, would opt for changeable models of one another of bounded complexity.<n>While these steps are only a beginning to go beyond rational expectations in economics, they seem promising. Whatever natural, or unnatural, games autonomous agents are playing as they and we coevolve in a biosphere or econo-sphere, nonstationarity arises on many levels. Here we see it at the level of the agents’ theories of one another and the actions based on those theories. Perhaps this is just part of how the world works. Given the semantic import of yuck and yum, and the reality of natural games for fox and hare, for E. coli and paramecium, these changing theories and actions are part of the fabric of history of the market, the savannah, and the small pond.<n>Natural rationality is bounded by the very nonstationarity of the worlds we cocreate as we coexapt.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
Because the total utility to the consumer is a simple sum of the discounted utilities of all the possible goods in the economy, finding the optimal plan at any period is just a linear programming problem, and the results are a fixed ratio of construction activities of all the objects produced at that period. The fixed ratio of the activities is the mirror of price, relative to one good, taken as the arbitrary “currency,” or “numeraire.”<n>Over time, the model economy ticks forward. At each period, in general, only some of the possible goods and services are constructed. The others do not make the consumer happy enough. Over time, new goods and services come into existence, and old ones go out of existence in small and large avalanches of speciation and extinction events.<n>Thus, a grammar model, or a physical instantiation of a grammar model such as Lego World, is a toy world with a technology graph of objects and transformations. With the addition of utilities to the dierent objects for one consumer or a set of consumers and a social planner  or more generally, with a set of utilities for the objects that may dier among consumers and with dierent costs and scaling of costs with sizes of production runs of dierent Lego objects  a market economy can be constructed. With defined start-up costs, costs of borrowing money, and bankruptcy rules, a model economy with an evolving set of goods and services can be created and studied.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
I believe such object-based economic web tools will come into existence in the near future. Indeed, Bios Group is involved in inventing and making them. And I believe that such tools will be very powerful means of coordinating activities within supply chains and within the larger economy when linked by automated markets.<n>But I do not believe any such algorithmic tool can be complete. Consider the case of the engineers discovering that the engine block is so rigid that the block itself can serve as the chassis for the tractor they are trying to invent. That exaptation seems a genuine discovery. Now imagine that we had had Java object models of all the parts that were to go into the tractor: engine block objects, carburetor objects, piston objects. If, among the properties of the engine block  the proud “is a,” “has a,” “does a,” features  we had not listed ahead of time the very rigidity of the engine block or if that rigidity was not deducible from the other listed properties, then my vaunted economic web model with its algorithmically accessible adjacent possible could not have ever come up with the suggestion: Use the engine block, due to its rigidity, as the chassis.<n>You see again that unless there is a finite predescription of all the potentially relevant properties of a real physical object, our algorithmic approach can be powerful, but incomplete. Yet I cannot see how to construct such a finite predescription of all the potentially relevant properties of a real physical object in the real universe.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
I must say to Arrow and Debreu, “Gentlemen, the set of goods and services is not finitely prestatable, so fixed-point theorems are of limited use.”<n>And to my economist colleagues: Consider the economy as forever becoming, burgeoning with new ways of making a living, new ways of creating value and advantages of trade, while old ways go extinct. This too is the proper subject for your study, not just allocation of scarce resources and achievement of market-clearing prices. The economy, like the biosphere, is about persistent creativity in ways of making a living.<n>I find it intriguing to note certain parallels from our prior discussion of autonomous agents and propagating organization. At the level of molecular autonomous agents, I made the point repeatedly that work is the constrained release of energy and that autonomous agents do carry out work to construct the constraints on the release of energy such that the energy is released along specific channels and such that specific couplings of nonequilibrium energy sources to propagating organization arise. Think then of the role of laws and contracts, whose constraints enable the linked flow of economic activities down particular corridors of activities. The web of economic activities flows down channels whose constraints are largely legal in nature. The coming into existence of the enabling constraints of law is as central to economic development and growth as any other aspect of the bubbling activity.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
But recall Boeing’s question. They wanted to build a family of related objects. Hence, let us define still another related sense of robustly constructible.<n>Consider a family of Lego objects, a house, and a house with a chimney. Now consider each of the many ways from the founder set to build the Lego house. For each such way to build the Lego house, consider how to change construction minimally in order to build the Lego house with the chimney. Perhaps the chimney can just be added to the completed Lego house. More likely, it would be necessary to partially deconstruct that completed Lego house, then go on to construct the house with the chimney. So there is a last branch point during construction on the way both to the Lego house and the Lego house with the chimney.<n>The branch point object and/or operation that is simultaneously on the way to the house and the house with the chimney is an interesting intermediate-complexity object or operation because it is polyfunctional. It can be used in at least two further ways.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt
The “molecular clock hypothesis” seems to fit these facts. If one compares hemoglobins from humans, chimps, horses, whales, and so on, in general, the longer ago we diverged from one another in the evolutionary record, the more amino acid mutations distinguish the hemoglobins of the two species involved. Our hemoglobin is very similar to chimp hemoglobin and quite dierent from the whale. So good is this correlation that, within given protein families, it is argued that mutations accumulate with timelike clockwork, hence the molecular clock hypothesis, in which a number of amino acid dierences can be taken as a surrogate for time from the most common ancestor. Dierent protein family clocks seem to run at dierent rates.<n>There is evidence that the clock does not run quite smoothly. John Gillespie, a population biologist now at the University of California at Davis, showed some years ago that amino acid substitutions seemed to come in short bursts that accumulate over long periods of time to a rough molecular clock that “stutters.” Gillespie argued that fitness landscapes were episodically shifting and the bursts of amino acid substitutions were adaptive runs toward nearby newly formed peaks. I agree and suggest that the near accuracy of the molecular clock data over hundreds of millions of years and virtually all species strongly suggests that the biosphere has coconstructed itself such that species, even as they speciate and go extinct, are, as lineages, in the persistently survivable regime.<n>We as organisms have, in fact, constructed our ways of making a living such that those problem spaces are typically, but not always, solvable as coevolution proceeds. And, on average, the same thing holds for the econosphere. As old ways of making a living go extinct, new ones persistently enter. We too, it appears, have coconstructed our econosphere such that our ways of making a living, and discovering new ways of making a living, are manageable, probably in a self-organized critical manner, with small and large speciation and extinction events.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt

What is required to be adaptable as an organism or organization? We discussed this in the last chapter. A good guess is that an organism or organization needs to be poised in an ordered regime, near the edge of chaos, where a power law distribution of small and large avalanches of change propagates through the system such that it optimizes the persistent balance between exploration and exploitation on ever-shifting, coevolving fitness landscapes.<n>	#non-fiction#	non-fiction_Kauffman_ch9.txt

At 9:36, the FAA's Boston Center called NEADS and relayed the discovery about an unidentified aircraft closing in on Washington:"Latest report. Aircraft VFR [visual flight rules] six miles southeast of the White House. . . . Six, southwest. Six, southwest of the White House, deviating away." This startling news prompted the mission crew commander at NEADS to take immediate control of the airspace to clear a flight path for the Langley fighters:"Okay, we're going to turn it . . . crank it up. . . . Run them to the White House." He then discovered, to his surprise, that the Langley fighters were not headed north toward the Baltimore area as instructed, but east over the ocean." I don't care how many windows you break," he said." Damn it. . . . Okay. Push them back."<n>The Langley fighters were heading east, not north, for three reasons. First, unlike a normal scramble order, this order did not include a distance to the target or the target's location. Second, a "generic" flight plan-prepared to get the aircraft airborne and out of local airspace quickly-incorrectly led the Langley fighters to believe they were ordered to fly due east (090) for 60 miles. Third, the lead pilot and local FAA controller incorrectly assumed the flight plan instruction to go "090 for 60" superseded the original scramble order.<n>After the 9:36 call to NEADS about the unidentified aircraft a few miles from the White House, the Langley fighters were ordered to Washington, D.C. Controllers at NEADS located an unknown primary radar track, but "it kind of faded" over Washington. The time was 9:38. The Pentagon had been struck by American 77 at 9:37:46. The Langley fighters were about 150 miles away.<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
At 9:42, the Command Center learned from news reports that a plane had struck the Pentagon. The Command Center's national operations manager, Ben Sliney, ordered all FAA facilities to instruct all aircraft to land at the nearest airport. This was an unprecedented order. The air traffic control system handled it with great skill, as about 4,500 commercial and general aviation aircraft soon landed without incident.<n>At 9:46 the Command Center updated FAA headquarters that United 93 was now "twenty-nine minutes out of Washington, D.C." At 9:49, 13 minutes after Cleveland Center had asked about getting military help, the Command Center suggested that someone at headquarters should decide whether to request military assistance: FAA Headquarters: They're pulling Jeff away to go talk about United 93.<n>Command Center: Uh, do we want to think, uh, about scrambling aircraft?<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt
The President's motorcade departed at 9:35, and arrived at the airport between 9:42 and 9:45. During the ride the President learned about the attack on the Pentagon. He boarded the aircraft, asked the Secret Service about the safety of his family, and called the Vice President. According to notes of the call, at about 9:45 the President told the Vice President:"Sounds like we have a minor war going on here, I heard about the Pentagon. We're at war . . . somebody's going to pay."<n>About this time, Card, the lead Secret Service agent, the President's military aide, and the pilot were conferring on a possible destination for Air Force One. The Secret Service agent felt strongly that the situation in Washington was too unstable for the President to return there, and Card agreed. The President strongly wanted to return to Washington and only grudgingly agreed to go elsewhere. The issue was still undecided when the President conferred with the Vice President at about the time Air Force One was taking off. The Vice President recalled urging the President not to return to Washington. Air Force One departed at about 9:54 without any fixed destination. The objective was to get up in the air-as fast and as high as possible-and then decide where to go.<n>At 9:33, the tower supervisor at Reagan National Airport picked up a hotline to the Secret Service and told the Service's operations center that "an aircraft [is] coming at you and not talking with us." This was the first specific report to the Secret Service of a direct threat to the White House. No move was made to evacuate the Vice President at this time. As the officer who took the call explained, "[I was] about to push the alert button when the tower advised that the aircraft was turning south and approaching Reagan National Airport."<n>	#technical#	technical_911report_chapter-1.txt

Amsterdam Parks<n>There are many wooded and park areas around the city where it’s possible to take a simple stroll or enjoy other outdoor activities. Amsterdam Bos (city woodland and recreational area), is the largest and most varied and offers a lake for rowing, bridleways for horse rides, and tracks for cycling — you could hire a bike and spend the day here. Many Amsterdammers go running, frisbeeing, or simply take the dog for a walk. The stables at Amsterdam Bos offer woodland rides, a perfect way to clear the city air from your system (contact Manege de Amsterdamse; Tel. 643 1432).<n>In summer locals enjoy an activity called “day camping” which means heading for an open space, erecting a tent, and spending the day relaxing around it — perhaps with a barbecue.

Delftware. The pottery style we now know as Delft (after the city to the southeast of Amsterdam) was produced in potteries all across the country during the Golden Age.

Throughout the city you’ll find a range of souvenirs which epitomize the Holland of the tourist brochures. Wooden clogs feature prominently, either plain or painted in bright colors.

Perched on the edge of the Bairro Alto is the Igreja do Carmo, devastated in the earthquake of 1755 but deliberately preserved as an atmospheric ruin and potent reminder of its impact. Nearby, the sumptuous, 16th-century Igreja de São Roque, features a small museum of sacred art.<n>You can walk to this area easily from the central squares, but it’s also fun to go by tram or instead to board the landmark 30-meter (98-foot) Elevador de Santa Justa, which you’ll find just off the Rossio square in the Baixa, the lower city. This 1902 Victorian marvel of iron and glass was built by Raul Mesnier. The longer, slower way back downhill meanders through the upmarket shopping area of Chiado, now totally rebuilt after a 1988 fire that swept through the district.<n>The Baixa is Lisbon’s principal business district. The main square is the Praça Dom Pedro IV, better known as the Rossio. Look out for the railway station, Estação do Rossio, which looks like a Moorish palace with horseshoe arches, just west of the square. Two blocks north is another lively square, Praça dos Restauradores, which leads to the leafy main thoroughfare, Avenida da Liberdade. The city plunges steeply downhill to the River Tagus and its most imposing square, Praça do Comércio, lined on three sides by gracious arcaded buildings and a vast triumphal arch. The grand square, wholly wiped out by the great earthquake of 1755, has seen its share of watershed political events: King Carlos and his son were felled by assassin’s bullets in the praça in 1908, and one of the first uprisings of the Carnation Revolution of 1974 was staged in this place.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
As Spanish influence faded, the Dutch star began to rise. First, they drew up agreements with the Portuguese, who had themselves concluded trade treaties in the East making them the sole source of new goods such as spices and silks. Merchants from Amsterdam bought these goods and sold them in the north, making vast profits in the process.<n>When the Spanish took Portugal in 1580, the Amsterdam merchants decided to go into the import business themselves, and in 1595 sent their first fleet to Asia. In 1602 the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded and it obtained a monopoly on all trade routes east of the Cape of Good Hope. It founded a headquarters in Batavia (now Jakarta) in Java and obtained a monopoly trade agreement with Japan in 1641. VOC ships under the command of Abel Tasman landed in Australia some 150 years before Captain Cook.<n>The Dutch also looked to the west, and in 1609 sent Englishman Henry Hudson to search for a route to China. In fact, he landed far from China and discovered the river which still bears his name — the Hudson; he also traded with the native peoples for the purchase of Manhattan Island and travelled to the Caribbean, taking several islands as Dutch colonies.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-History.txt

Travel further along Herengracht to the end of the second block. Here you will find one of the most fascinating views of the canal ring. From the bridge it is possible to see 14 other bridges by looking up and down Herengracht and ahead down the adjoining Reguliersgracht (this view is even better at water level, so take a canal cruise — and your camera!). Reguliersgracht has some very pretty houses and is quieter than the main three “girdle” canals built at this time.<n>The small square here is Thorbeckeplein and you will see a suitably somber statue of Johan Rudolf Thorbecke who designed the Dutch constitution in 1848. Wander through the square, which hosts an art market on Sundays, to reach Rembrandtsplein, one of the city’s most vibrant social centers. Before 1878 this square was called Botermarkt, (a butter market was held here in the 19th century) but the square was renamed after the large statue of Rembrandt was sited here. One wonders what he would have made of the square, for since the statue was unveiled, it has attracted theaters, cinemas, clubs, and show halls, along with a plethora of bars and restaurants and a curtain of vibrant neon signs all around the façade. On a summer evening it is one of the best places to sit with a drink and watch the world go by, and is within easy reach of a romantic walk along the canalsides.<n>Beyond the eastern end of Waterlooplein you will see the Visserplein, busy with several lanes of traffic. Head across the square to Weesperstraat to find the Joods Historisch Museum (Jewish Historical Museum) which documents the history of the once large and influential Jewish community in the city. Jewish history dates back to the late 16th century, but was cut short by the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam in 1940. The systematic deportation of the Jewish population to concentration camps destroyed the community and after the war only a handful of the thousands forced to leave returned to their homes.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
The Rijksmuseum<n>Pride of place must go to the Rijksmuseum (The National Art Gallery) with arguably the greatest collection of Dutch art in the world. The collection is housed in a magnificent Victorian Gothic building, especially designed for it by P. J. H. Cuypers, which was opened in 1885. The museum can be a confusing maze of connecting rooms — additions were completed in 1898 and 1919 — so it pays to sit down for a few minutes to study the very comprehensive map, which accompanies your ticket. A multimedia interactive study area also allows you to review the vast collection on a screen, pinpoint works which you want to see, and print out further details of each piece. The center, called ARIA (Amsterdam Rijksmuseum InterActief), is located in room 225, behind the Night Watch room. You can also take advantage of an audio CD tour to give you background detail as you explore.<n>The collection is varied but most visitors come to see the works of the Dutch masters. Dutch painting of the 15th to 17th centuries are to be found in rooms 201 to 236 on the second floor. Among the collection are 20 works by Rembrandt, including The Nightwatch, properly entitled The Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq and Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch. The work, which was commissioned by the company for its barracks, is remarkable for its lack of formality and very different from the accepted style of the day.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt
At the end of the fifth century b.c., Greece entered the period of the Persian Wars, as recorded in Herodotus’ great narrative history of the ancient world (see page 33).<n>The Persian Empire’s far-flung lands included a number of Greek settlements on the coast of what is now Turkey. When the Greek towns attempted a revolt in 499 b.c., Athens sent an expedition to aid their uprising. The revolt failed, but the Persian king, Darius, could not let such impudence go unpunished, and in 490 b.c. he confidently launched an invasion of Attica. Although the Persians’ forces and resources were vastly superior, Darius hadn’t anticipated the amazing courage and battlefield skill of the Greeks.<n>A fleet of around 600 Persian vessels landed troops at Marathon beach. Led by General Miltiades, the Athenians inflicted a crippling and humiliating defeat on the Persians. According to legend, the soldier who ran from Marathon to Athens — a distance of 42 km (26 miles) — to report the victory then died of exhaustion. His feat is still commemorated today in the Olympic race known as the marathon.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-History.txt
Taking the Metro (the overland electric railway section) from downtown Athens costs only 250drs and brings you directly to the waterside. Huge quaysides in the Main Harbor cater to hundreds of ferries large and small, and you’ll see fleets of large container ships laying anchor offshore. Walking south along the quaysides brings you to a small shady square with the Cathedral of Agia Triada on its northern flank. Take this street (Dimokratias) to the Town Hall and visit the lively daily market that takes place in the surrounding streets.<n>Take a right down Lampraki to reach the pretty harbor of Zea. This is one of the marinas used for pleasure craft, and where Athenians — rich and not so rich — moor their boats. These range from simple rowing boats of just a few feet in length to hundred-foot ocean-going vessels. A wide promenade  — Akti Moutsopoulou — frames the bay and this is where local people come to stroll in the evenings and on weekends —  you can sit at a portside café and watch the world go by.<n>North from Zea harbor is another pretty harbor, Mikrolimani (Small Harbor) or Tourkolimani, where you’ll find the fishing fleet and some good fish tavernas. Or head south towards the main historical attractions of Piraeus.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Athens-WhereToGo.txt
The Bahamian people are among the friendliest you’ll ever meet, and they are eager to share the homeland they love with visitors. The population is a fascinating mixture of descendants of the Loyalist settlers who left America after the American Revolution, freedom lovers who escaped religious persecution, and ex-slaves set free following emancipation. This mixture, which could have produced a society fraught with problems, has evolved into a gentle, sociable, and happy people, proud of their homeland and the progress they have made since independence in 1973. With a stable economy, good health, and no taxes, it’s no wonder that a smile comes naturally to all Bahamians. All the communities still have strong religious faith, the pretty churches are full on Sundays, and a conversation about some future event always ends with “…God willing” or “…with the Lord’s blessing.”<n>To make the most of your trip you’ll need to tune your mind to “Bahamian time.” On New Providence and Grand Bahama this may not be much slower than at home, but on the Out Islands, time definitely runs more slowly, and nothing is so important that it can’t wait a while. People are more important than to-do lists, so a leisurely exchange of greetings and an inquiry about your family’s well-being precedes any business activity. This genuine thoughtfulness also extends to visitors; someone will always go out of their way to be helpful, in ways that have been lost in more developed locations.<n>Every island has its own individual character, forged by a unique history and development, in fact the Bahamas could be said to be several different holiday experiences in one country, so it’s important to choose your island carefully to get the kind of holiday you want.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-Intro.txt
On many of the islands, renting a boat is as easy as renting a car is in other destinations — especially on the more populated Out Islands. Rentals can vary from small runabouts that will get you around the harbor and the coastal shallows to large sailing yachts and motor launches for inter-island expeditions. Rates vary enormously. To make more of a stay in the Abacos or Exumas, where there are many outlaying cays, you can rent a 18-ft (51⁄2-m) boat with small outboard motor for around $80 per day. Larger vessels come with a crew and/or guide; if you sail your own boat, you can take advantage of the services of a local guide to take you to fishing, snorkeling, or dive sites.<n>The Abacos are most popular spot for sailing, primarily because of the many sheltered harbors and the many islands and cays that you can reach without having to go outside of the reefs and into ocean waters. If you want to get out and see a lot of boats without doing any sailing, head to the Bahamas during the Regattas, when boats crowd the harbors and the little towns are full of yachtsmen. Listen to the stories of heroic deeds in the bars and enjoy the wonderful views of masts filling the skies.<n>For information about sailing rentals contact The Moorings (Tel. 367-4000; fax 367-4004; website <http://www.moorings. com>). Smaller boats for local jaunts can be rented at Sea Horse Boat Rentals, Marsh Harbour, Abacos (Tel. 367-2513; fax 367-2516; website <http://www.sea-horse.com>. Nassau Yacht Haven also has sailboats for rent (Tel. 393-8173).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhatToDo.txt
The straw market fronts onto Bay Street, one of the leading duty-free shopping capitals of the world. Only a few years ago this street was the domain of the Bay Street Boys, a small group of men who controlled all economic activity in the Bahamas; now Bay Street seduces visitors with huge sparkling gems, hundreds of ounces of gold, and the smell of a thousand designer fragrances. The façades of the pretty 18th-century shops hide modern air-conditioned shopping palaces piled high with luxury goods.<n>Many visitors, especially those with only a few hours to spare, go no farther than the shops of Nassau — shopping for a bargain can be exhausting. It would be a shame, however, not to explore what the rest of Nassau has to offer, as there are a number of historic gems to be discovered in and around the town. The Bahamian people appreciate and enjoy the many touches of colonial history retained from its days as part of the British Empire. Rawson Square, just in front of the entrance to Prince George Wharf, is a good place to start your tour. The tourist information office here can arm you with leaflets and maps that will help you make the most of your day. Directly opposite Rawson Square, across Bay Street, are the Public Buildings of Parliament Square, which have been in continuous use since 1812. They were modeled on the governmental complex in New Bern, capital of the North Carolina colony two centuries ago. A marble statue of a young, seated Queen Victoria in front recalls the era of British rule. The two chambers of the modern House of Assembly meet in the so-called western building (on the right side if you’re facing from the square); the public-records office and government publications department are housed in the other historic buildings. Behind them in modern edifices are the Law Courts. Here you may find yourself in the middle of a parade to open parliament or convene the courts. The smart uniforms and pomp are taken directly from British ceremonial activities, but the ambiance is truly Bahamian. Check with the Tourist Board for dates of ceremonial occasions, all of which happen frequently.<n>Behind the modern law court complex is the Nassau Public Library, interesting because it used to be the island’s jail. The octagonal structure on Shirley Street dates from 1797 and has a pretty exterior, but the interior is more fascinating. The old cells were retained when the structure became the library in 1873 and books line every wall, replacing prisoners and creating private reading areas. The library museum also has a collection of old maps and charts used to navigate the waters around the Bahamas.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
Nearby is Ardastra Gardens, Zoo, and Conservation Centre, a landscaped park famed for its pink flamingos, which are paraded three times a day into a small enclosure to offer visitors a closer look. These birds, once common in certain Bahamian islands, are now disappearing, though the reasons for the decline are disputed. Another endangered species, the Bahamian Parrot, is under threat from loss of habitat. The Gardens is one of only a small number of centers that has developed a breeding program for this vocal and gregarious bird in the hope of replenishing colonies in the wild. There are many more species of Caribbean mammals, reptiles, birds, and fish to find as you explore the 51⁄2 acres of tropical parkland.<n>Head back to the main coast road and you will find two small cays lying immediately offshore. The first is Arawak Cay, home to the local fishing fleet. A number of colorful shacks line the approach road where you can buy conch and fried fish, always fresh and always delicious. Weekends can be busy with local families. Travel through Arawak Cay to reach Silver Cay, where there is a small resort with a pretty beach. Here you will find Crystal Cay, site of a marine park where you can take a close look at the undersea world without getting wet. A man-made coral reef has been created on the sea bottom and you can watch all the marine activity from an underwater observatory. The reef attracts many kinds of aquatic creatures that are free to come and go as they please. The observatory looks decidedly futuristic and can be seen quite clearly from the road as you travel along the coast. Other activities at Crystal Cay include a sea turtle environment, a touch pool where you can stroke a sting ray or pet a conch, and a snorkel trail, if you want to get into the water yourself.<n>A little further west along the coast you will find Cable Beach, the third main center of tourism on New Providence. Several luxury hotels line the shore, only 5 minutes by car from central Nassau. The Nassau Marriott Resort Hotel attracts many visitors with its casino, stage shows, and restaurants. The Cable Beach “strip” is under continual development, and a number of private restaurants have opened recently to provide alternatives for guests staying at the resorts.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
The island itself also has peculiarities that separate it from other Bahamian Islands. It is the most undulating of the islands; one could even call it hilly, with the highest point of land in the Commonwealth, Mount Alvernia, rising to the heady heights of 216 ft (66m) above sea level.<n>Many visitors come to this island, named after an English sea captain called Catt, for its beautiful quiet beaches. Fernandez Bay, with its arc of fine sand on the protected western side of the island, is said to be the finest in the Bahamas, and the nearby beach at Old Bight is not far behind in terms of beauty. Though you can’t go wrong anywhere on the western coast.<n>Mount Alvernia, in the center of the island, is not far from the airfield at New Bight. This settlement originally served as a hermitage for Father Jerome, an Anglican missionary who had converted to Catholicism and become an influential churchman on the Out Islands, responsible for the erection of a number of Catholic Churches. Father Jerome built a small Hermitage on the heights of Mount Alvernia that you’ll see as you reach the summit (a 15-minute walk from a rudimentary car park); the missionary was buried in a small hilltop cave here upon his death in 1956 at the age of 80. A more recent famous Cat Islander is the actor Sidney Poitier, who was born in Arthur’s Town in the north. He is now non-resident Bahamian Ambassador to Japan.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt
The sign “Parasite Carvings” might puzzle you. A new idea, imported from the West, is to take the galls and other strange growths that occur on tree trunks and carve them into a witty or grotesque design, using the natural shape.<n>Jewelry: The village of Celuk (see page 40) specialized in producing silver and gold jewelry for centuries, so when tourism arrived, its position on the Denpasar-Ubud road was ideal. Dozens of tour buses stop at the big shops but there are many little workshops worth visiting, too. The smiths can produce any style: from intricate filigree work to simple bracelets. You don’t have to go to Celuk though, since every resort area has its share of shops. Silver should bear the “925” stamp of sterling silver (meaning it’s 92.5% pure).<n>Clothes and Fabrics: Bali is a huge bargain basement for a selection of beachwear, casual clothing, and, at a higher price but still excellent value, fashion designs. For the biggest choice of shops go to Kuta, and look for dresses, shirts, sarongs, and cover-ups in traditional batik fabric.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhatToDo.txt

For the biggest choice of shops go to Kuta, and look for dresses, shirts, sarongs, and cover-ups in traditional batik fabric.<n>Batik dyeing technique uses hot wax to draw or stamp a design on cloth before dipping it in the dye, so that the waxed areas are left undyed. The process can be repeated a number of times for greater complexity. Java is the source of the batik for dresses and sarongs sold in fashion shops; Balinese versions are usually much coarser. Hawkers will swear that their dress lengths of cheap printed cotton are batik. It’s easy to tell that they are not: Printed patterns don’t penetrate fully to the other side, while the real batik will show thin veins of color where the dye runs along tiny cracks in the wax (printed versions may try to simulate this). Real batik is always much more expensive. Used batik sarongs are highly prized, as their patterns are often no longer produced. Used batik can be bought for very low fixed prices at textile shops like Alec, on Jalan Legian in Kuta-Legian.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhatToDo.txt
Bali FORCHILDREN<n>The Balinese treasure their children and yours will get the same treatment. Some resorts run children’s activity programs during the day, show videos in the early evening, and at night offer a babysitting service when you want to go off on your own. In losmen and homestay accommodations, the children of the owner’s family will probably want to make friends, and the older girls may offer to act as babysitters.<n>Children will, of course, revel in the hotel pools and the beaches, the slides at the Waterbom park in Tuban, and when the conditions are right, they can learn to snorkel, sail, and windsurf — but think about their safety. The well-planned Taman Burung Bali Bird Park, with over a hundred species of birds, is always a hit with children.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhatToDo.txt
Towards sunset, a golden light reflects off the sea and local people come out to stroll or paddle in the shallows. Young men play soccer on the sand or join the tourists in a volleyball game, while the eager beach masseuses rustle up a new wave of business.<n>At nightfall, new choices beckon. You can inspect Bali’s selection of shops, pick a restaurant, go on a pub crawl, or see a movie and wait for midnight when the discos get into gear.<n>Kuta’s Neighbors<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
Mengwi<n>Just to the northwest of Kapal, there’s a major road junction. The right fork goes north to Bedugul (see page 61) and Singaraja, but you only have to go 3 km (2 miles) to reach the town of Mengwi, where you’ll find one of Bali’s most beautiful temples.<n>Pura Taman Ayun, near the center of town, was built in 1634 and renovated in 1937. It’s notable for its double moat. Every morning as well as late in the afternoon, people use the wide outer moat for washing themselves and their clothes. You can circle the outside of the wall that surrounds the inner compound and look in at the cluster of merus (pagoda-like, multi-roofed towers). Meru towers may only contain an odd number of roofs.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
The silhouette of Gunung Rinjani, 3,726 m (12,200 ft) tall, can be seen from every part of the island, sometimes as a single peak, other times like a line of broken teeth. An active volcano (although there has been no major eruption for a century), the mountain is sacred to both Sasaks and Balinese, who make pilgrimages to its crater lake and hot springs. Recently it has begun to attract foreigners, too, and two villages in the foothills to the south of Bayan are the most popular starting points. Trekking is only safe in the dry season, between June and September.<n>A rough and narrow road from the middle of Bayan ascends rapidly to Batu Koq, and then continues to nearby Senaru, where it ends. Those wanting to go farther have to walk. The original tiny village has traditional Sasak houses on stilts, surrounded by a wooden fence. Some of the locals have opened homestays along the road, a few with a warung attached. Guides and porters can be hired by the day, and you can buy basic food and rent camping gear, including tents. Take water-purifying tablets, warm clothes, and arrange for a small camping stove.<n>The main objective of most trekkers is the awesome crater with its big C-shaped lake. It’s a hard day’s walk from Senaru before you reach the rim. The crater itself is 600 m (2,000 ft) deep, and the steep, quite slippery scramble down to the lake takes several hours more. Plan at least a three-day expedition (five if you also want to climb to the top of Rinjani). Those with a lot less time and energy could take a half-hour walk to a beautiful waterfall and pools in the valley below Senaru.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bali-WhereToGo.txt
The best items to look for include fashionable clothing, shoes, and leather products; antiques; books (Barcelona is the publishing capital of Spain); high-tech design, home furnishings, and objets d’art; and music.<n>In the Eixample, Passeig de Gràcia and Rambla de Catalunya are great window-shopping streets, with some of Barcelona’s finest boutiques for fashion, jewelry, and home design. The nearby streets Mallorca, Valencia, and Provença are also overflowing with interesting shops. Avda. Diagonal, which cuts across Barcelona, has some of the finest and most expensive stores in Barcelona. It’s where to go if your tastes run to Armani and your wallet can catch up.<n>The area near Las Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter are also excellent spots for shopping. Plaça de Catalunya, the entrance to the old city, is the jumping-off point for some of its principal shopping streets. Avda. Portal de l’Angel and carrer Portaferrisa are always swarming with shoppers. La Rambla itself relies on a heavy tourist trade in trinkets, such as bullfight posters plastered with your name as the featured matador, leather (or plastic) wineskins called botas, and their glass relative, the porrón; imitation Toledo steel with the engraving painted on; imitation dueling pistols; and tawdry sex-shop toys. Still, you don’t have to look too hard to find succulent pastry shops and creative jewelry stores.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt
For quintessential Catalan design, Vinçon (Passeig de Gràcia, 96), Barcelona’s premiere design emporium, contains just about everything that could be considered functional and well designed. It stocks expensive lighting and funky furniture, as well as watches, kitchen utensils, and writing instruments. Vinçon is known for its whimsical display windows, an enticement if you’re traveling with someone whose idea of fun is anything but shopping. BD Ediciones de Diseño (c/ Mallorca, 291-293), in a gorgeous modernista mansion designed by Domènech i Montaner, deals in high-end Catalan design, especially furniture. Pilma (Avda. Diagonal, 403) competes with the previous stores, although with less innate style. Another good place to have a look is the small design-oriented shop within the Museu de Textil i d’Indumentaria (Montacada, 12).<n>A close second to home furnishings in the minds of many Barcelonans is fashion design, and several important Catalan and Spanish designers have shops in Barcelona. Look for cool fashions for men and women by Antonio Miró at his signature store, Consell de Cent, 349, and at Groc, on Rambla de Catalunya, 100, at Provença. The Galician designer Adolfo Domínguez has shops across Spain; his fashions are slightly more mainstream. In Barcelona, there are branches at Passeig de Gràcia, 32; Avda. Diagonal, 570; and Passeig de Gràcia, 89. Loewe (Passeig de Gràcia, 35) is Spain’s premier upscale leather goods store. Before you spend your money here, consider that its display windows defaced Casa Lleó Morera, the classic modernista building in which the store is housed. Gonzalo Comella (Passeig de Gràcia) sells the designs of several labels, including Miró, Armani, and Ermenegildo Zegna. Bulevard Rosa (Avda. Diagonal; Passeig de Gràcia next to Bulevar dels Antiquaris; and c/ Mallorca) has a number of excellent clothing shops, including Polo (a Spanish shop, not affiliated with Ralph Lauren). For much more affordable, but still trendy clothes, you can’t go wrong with Zara, a chain that might be the European Gap or Banana Republic (Rambla de Catalunya at Aragó; Av. Portal de l’Angel).<n>For foodstuffs, Colmado Quílez (Rambla de Catalunya, 63), is a classic Catalan emporium, with packaged goods, fine wines, cheeses, and imported beer in a photogenic corner shop. Mercat La Boquería (see page 26) is the Barcelona produce, fish, and meat market that’s both an institution and a cultural experience. It’s not to be missed. For roasted nuts, dried fruits, coffee, and spices, the 150-year-old shop E&A Gispert (c/ Sobrerers, 23) near Santa María del Mar is a treat for at least two of your senses. For a religious experience and a history lesson with your foodstuffs shopping, visit Caelum (c/ de la Palla, 8), which stocks all kinds of products produced by monasteries around the world (Trappist monk beers, honey, candles, cheese, etc.) Downstairs is a cellar/tea room where ancient foundations of 14th-century baths were uncovered and are now on view.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt

If your thing is stamps and coins, go to the Plaça Reial on Sunday morning, or to the Sant Antoni market, which also sells records and books. The Plaça Sant Josep Oriol has a weekend art fair with artists selling watercolors and oil paintings.<n>entertainment<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt
The broad, tree-lined Avinguda Diagonal slices across Cerdà’s grid from the coast to the hills. Designed for through traffic, it links up with the ring roads around the city and the toll highways beyond. The area around the Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes, a busy roundabout linking main roads into the city, is largely industrial, but becomes more dignified to the west after crossing the Passeig de Sant Joan. Between the Passeig de Gràcia and the Plaça de Francesc Macià is one of Barcelona’s most elegant districts, with four-star hotels and luxury shops. Pricey restaurants and discotheques abound in adjoining streets.<n>A couple of miles west along the Diagonal, surrounded by a park, is the Palau Reial de Pedralbes, an estate of the Güell family converted into a royal residence in 1924 in case King Alfonso XIII should drop by. It now houses elements of the Museu de les Artes Decoratives (Museum of Decorative Arts) and a collection of carriages. Renaissance- and Baroque-period paintings from the Colecció Cambó, formerly in the Palau de la Virreina, are now hung here. Be sure to go around the park walls to see the dragon gate in wrought iron designed by Gaudí for the Güells.<n>The districts on the hillside beyond were once separate villages where residents of Barcelona town often spent summers and weekends. They’ve been gradually absorbed over the years by Barcelona’s expansion, but each still preserves its own unique character.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
Two of the greatest Qing emperors, Kangxi and his grandson Qianlong, maintained the Ming Tombs and saw to the building of the Summer Palace, while the last great imperial ruler of China, the Empress Dowager Cixi, kept the Summer Palace and the Forbidden City in splendid condition into the early 20th century. These and most other historic sites at Beijing were either preserved or created by the Qing rulers, including their own imperial tombs, which rival those of the Ming.<n>The Qing Dynasty is also celebrated for its elaboration of the artistic traditions it inherited from the Ming Dynasty. What we know as Peking-style opera and still see performed today in the capital became formalized under the Qing, although its roots (and costumes) go back to Ming and earlier eras. The Ming were also noted for their superb ink paintings, cloisonné enamel work, furniture design, and lacquerware — but above all for their porcelains of the “five-colors” and “blue-and-white” schools. At the end of the Ming, these porcelains with landscape and garden designs became all the rage in Europe, where imitation “Chinese” pottery began to be produced. The Qing continued these artistic traditions, adding increasingly rich and dense ornamentation and applying new colors, many of them clashing or gaudy.<n>This absorption in overly elaborate artwork, combined with heavy demands for imperial luxuries, finally coincided with a decline in the dynasty itself. In the 19th century the Qing rulers faced a new legion of invaders, not from the north (as in the past) but from the West, and they were unable to resist the tide.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Beijing-History.txt
With the huge successes of Boris Becker, Steffi Graf, and Michael Stich, tennis has now become a favorite national sport, with squash and badminton catching on fast, too. All three are well-served, so to speak, at courts citywide, notably Stromstraße and Brandenburgische Straße.<n>One surprise sport you may not have expected to practice in Berlin is hang-gliding, but it is, in fact, possible to throw yourself off the Teufelsberg, where you can also do a little skiing and sledding in winter (see page 64). However, you don’t have to go in search of snow to ski; the Glacier ski center in Pankow has the longest indoor ski course in the world.<n>Roller skating has become a way of life in Berlin; so much so that from spring to August, every second Wednesday in the month has been designated “Blade Night.” The streets of Mitte are closed to cars and open freely to in-line skaters. In the winter, the fun moves indoors — “Blade Night” is held in the Arena concert hall in Treptow.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhatToDo.txt

In spite of it attracting occasional protest marches from those who support the political Far Right, this formidable symbol of the united city generally appears at last to be realizing the vision of Johann Gottfried Schadow, the sculptor who crowned the Brandenburg Gate with the Quadriga, a copper statue of Winged Victory in her four-horse chariot. Schadow had wanted the gate to be known as the Friedenstor (Gate of Peace), in keeping with the relief of the Procession of Peace that he himself had sculpted beneath Victory’s simple chariot.<n>The gate itself, designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, was built between 1789 and 1791. With two rows of six Doric columns forming the gateway proper, it was inspired by the Propylaeum gatehouse leading to the Parthenon in Athens. (To go all the way, Hitler had even planned to hoist the gate onto an artificial hill, in an attempt to create a mini-Acropolis.) Forming part of the city wall, the gate was intended by the more pragmatic Prussians not so much as a triumphal arch as an imposing tollgate for collecting duties.<n>The gate was left isolated in no-man’s land when the Wall went up, and subsequently became the scene of quite ecstatic celebrations when it came down, though now you would scarcely believe it as Berliners cross nonchalantly from east to west through Brandenburg’s mighty central arch.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Berlin-WhereToGo.txt
The capital of Bermuda since 1815, Hamilton is a very small and friendly city, despite its importance in the world of finance, banking, and insurance. It is the heart of government and decision making, and because it is the only container port on the island, it is also the center of shipping and trade. Local people gravitate here for shopping and entertainment, and visitors crowd the streets in summer when the cruise ships are in town.<n>Front Street runs along the water and is the first part of town seen by cruise passengers as ships come to shore. It is the life and soul of Hamilton and a focus for many activities, especially during the summer months. A long row of pastel-painted buildings offer the best in tax-free shopping: jewelry, liquor, clothing, and crystal. Explore the narrow alleyways that lead off Front Street to discover small shops selling collectibles or locally designed arts and crafts, or small restaurants offering local seafood. On Front Street itself there are a number of restaurants with verandas on the first floor, where you can have a drink or meal and watch the world go by. At the west end of Front Street, on the waterfront, you will find the Visitor Service Bureau and the terminal for the local ferries that ply across Great and Little Sound from Hamilton to the southern and western parts of Bermuda.<n>On summer evenings, Front Street comes alive with Harbour Night. Street performers, craft stalls, and late-night shopping are all part of the festivities. There is also the Beat Retreat Ceremony, where the Band and Corps of Drums of the Bermuda Regiment and the Bermuda Islands Pipe Band, in full military dress, march the street to recreate a centuries-old ceremony.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
The main road leads east along the coast to John Smith’s Bay, a small but much-photographed beach for swimming and snorkeling. Just beyond the bay, there is a left turn leading to Devil’s Hole Aquarium, at the very southern tip of Harrington Sound. One of the oldest tourist attractions in Bermuda, it has been welcoming visitors since 1834. The hole is in fact a collapsed cave, producing a natural seawater aquarium that has become home to a number of voracious fish, sharks, and turtles waiting at the surface to be fed. The fish (usually large tarpon) seem to enjoy the regular food service offered by visitors. Incidentally, the name “Devil’s Hole” derives from the sound of the seawater entering and leaving the hole, rather than from the fearsome reputation of some of its inhabitants.<n>From Devil’s Hole Aquarium it is possible to take the road left to the village of Flatts and the North Shore Road. However, you can go back to South Road in the direction of Tucker’s Town and two important golf courses. Tucker’s Town is not a town but rather a collection of exclusive communities and large high-class resorts set in rolling hills and small sheltered coastal bays.<n>Mid Ocean Golf Course and Castle Harbour Golf Course straddle the roads here, their verdant greens and fairways tumbling across the undulating land, separated by small casuarina copses. (Be mindful of the state of play as you pass across the fairways here: there is a danger from flying or wayward balls!) The Mid Ocean Club is still a private members’ club with a long pedigree. It has played host to many important political summits since the end of World War II, including the “Big Three” Conference in 1953 attended by Winston Churchill, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Joseph Laniel, the French prime minister.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt

To get across Castle Harbour to St. George’s, you must go north here, taking Paynter’s Road to Harrington Sound. Then drive up along Harrington Sound Road to reach the Causeway to St. George’s.<n>On your way up Harrington Sound Road, you will come to Lemington Caves, a series of caves smaller than Crystal Caves but equally spectacular. Watch also for Walsingham Lane and a sign to Tom Moore’s Tavern, named after the Irish poet who spent some time on Bermuda. The tavern (which is in fact a restaurant with French and local cuisine) is open only in the evening. In the daytime you can visit Idwal Hughes Nature Reserve, also along Walsingham Lane — a pristine area of natural habitat. Collapsed limestone caves and tidal seawater mangrove swamps provide a perfect home for herons, tropical frogs, and many species of fish.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt
Charlestown<n>Across the river, the Charlestown Navy Yard has played a major role in Boston’s history for nearly two hundred years. Today it’s home to the indomitable “Old Ironsides,” or the U.S.S. Constitution, a war ship that was built in 1797 in the North End for $302,718. During her naval career, she won 42 battles, captured 20 vessels, and was undefeated. Her most notable triumphs occurred during the War of 1812 when she vanquished the British ships Guerriere, Java, Cyane, and Levant. A British sailor gave her the name “Old Ironsides,” as cannon balls skimmed off her copper sheathed gunwales and he marveled at her apparent indestructibility. Today you can go aboard to see the decks. Every July 4th she fires a salute and is taken out on a short cruise. You can also visit the World War II destroyer U.S.S. Cassin Young and take guided tours of the Naval Yard conducted by the park rangers. At the adjacent Constitution Museum you can computer skipper the Constitution through some of her famous battles and trace the route she took on her round the world trade mission in 1844. Exhibits also show how horrendous were the living conditions endured by her crew of 450.<n>Nearby, the 220-ft- (67- m-) tall tapering granite obelisk, the Bunker Hill Monument commemorates the first battle of the Revolution, on 17 June, 1775 — a hollow victory for the British who suffered more than 1,000 casualties against 400 to 600 for the colonials. Despite the name it actually stands on Breed’s Hill, the site of the colonial redoubt in the battle. At its base is a swashbuckling statue by William Wetmore Storey of American Colonel Prescott, who gave the famous order: “Don’t fire ’til you see the whites of their eyes.” There are informative models depicting the battle’s progress as well as hourly musket-firing demonstrations. You can climb the 294 spiral steps to an enclosed deck, which has great views. A multimedia presentation at The Bunker Hill Pavilion re-enacts the battle.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
State Street originally linked the wharves to the Old State House. Today it is a commercial street boasting the showy glass tower of the Stock Exchange Building (53 Exchange Place), which features a monumental marble staircase in the foyer. Another ostentatious marble atrium foyer marks number 75. At the harbor end stands the bizarre Custom House Tower, a skyscraper that was added to a 19th-century Greek Revival temple base in 1913.<n>For a good look at Downtown’s architecture, go to the green triangle of Post Office Square. Stepped sides and Art Deco–style wall decorations make the New England Telephone Building on the southern edge of the square one of the most arresting. The lobby’s 360-degree mural celebrates the proletarian history of the telephone. You can also pop in to a little room off the lobby that replicates the attic room of Alexander Bell on nearby Court Street. It was from there that he first transmitted sounds electrically over a wire in 1875 (open Monday–Friday, 8:30am–5pm).<n>There are said to be over 50 restaurants in Chinatown, the crowded blocks bordered by Washington, Kneeland, and Essex streets and the Expressway. Even if you don’t intend to eat here, you might enjoy visiting some of the Chinese jewelry stores, groceries, and bakeries, on the streets that feature pagoda-topped telephone boxes. It’s small compared to New York or San Francisco’s sprawling Chinatowns, so don’t bother unless you’re really interested.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
Wharves reach out into Boston Harbor from Downtown and the North End like the fingers on a hand. Once this was the second busiest port in the United States, with clippers jostling for space. Today after a long period of decline, the area has revived and the granite warehouses have been renovated into apartments, restaurants, offices, and hotels. The British sailed home from Long Wharf. Today you can sail to the Harbor Islands, take a cruise around the harbor, or just sit and admire the craft at anchor.<n>On Central Wharf, the New England Aquarium is one of the best anywhere. Its centerpiece is a giant 200,000-gallon tank containing a 24-ft- (7-m-) deep coral reef filled with sharks, sea turtles, and 600 fish from 100 species. Five times a day, scuba divers go in to feed the fish, a fascinating spectacle to watch. Ramps circle the tank so that you can walk around the whole thing. More than 70 exhibit tanks make up the Aquarium galleries. They are categorized as salt or fresh water and feature communities of fish inhabiting different marine climates, from cold and temperate to tropical. Visitors can see the life forms found in a salt marsh, a mangrove swamp, or along the New England seashore. Kids love the Touch Tide Pool where they can handle crabs and starfish. Other perennial favorites are the penguins, the sea otters, and the sea lions, who provide entertainment in the theater. The aquarium is currently undergoing an expansion that will triple its size. The new West Wing containing a large outdoor seal exhibit, two floors of exhibits, plus visitor facilities opened in 1998. A large-format theater will open in 2001 and the new East Wing in 2003.<n>To the south Rowes Wharf hosts many different cruise ships and also anchors the luxurious Boston Harbor Hotel.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
On the other side of the square the Boston Public Library (1895), the oldest free municipal library in the world), is well worth visiting. The grand Italian Renaissance building has several decorative highlights — the bronze doors by Daniel Chester French at the Dartmouth entrance, the double marble staircase graced with murals by Puvis de Chavannes and Edwin Austin Abbey, and on the third floor, by John Singer Sargent. The Johnson Building was added in 1972 and now the library holds more than six million books stored on 65 miles of shelves.<n>Copley Place, on Huntington Avenue, is a large shopping mall, anchored by two 1,000-room hotels, with a hundred-plus shops. A walkway connects it to the graceless 52-story Prudential Center, from which the famous amphibious vehicles leave on Boston Duck Tours. After touring the shops, go up to the Top of The Hub bar-restaurant and Skywalk (open Monday–Friday, 10am–7pm) great vantage points from which to see the Hancock Tower. The Skywalk is quieter and more spacious than the neighboring observatory, though the views are less impressive.<n>A little farther along Huntington Avenue, the Christian Science World Headquarters may not sound enticing (and indeed, the austerity of the administration buildings around a vast reflecting pool makes a somber first impression). Still, the huge basilica of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, a huge Byzantine-style church enveloping the original Mother Church is an amazing edifice. It can hold 4,000; its tiered seating makes it more like a theater than a place of worship. The organ, which is the focal point of the space, contains 13,595 pipes covering nine octaves.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Boston-WhereToGo.txt
The main classical music venues are in Pest: the Academy of Music (Liszt Ferenc tér), and the Basilica and the Béla Bartók Memorial House (Csalán út 29); venues in Buda include the Matthias Church and the Museum of Music History. During the summer, open-air performances are staged under the stars on Margaret Island or before authentic ancient backdrops in castle courtyards.<n>Tickets are available centrally: for the concert performances go to the ofﬁce at Vörösmarty tér, 1; for opera, go to Andrássy út 18. Larger hotels will also make bookings for you, or you can simply go direct to the venue box ofﬁce. Tourinform also sells some concert tickets. The most comprehensive listings are given by the publication Pesti Musor and Koncert Kalendárium (Hungarian language only). A good free publication is Pesti Est, available at box offices, hotels, and restaurants.<n>Musicals from Broadway and London’s West End (like Cats, Les Misérables, etc.) can be enjoyed in Budapest, as long as you don’t mind a little Hungarian in between the songs. Tickets are on sale at the Andrássy út booking ofﬁce.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhatToDo.txt
The main roads of Budapest, and particularly Pest, are busy with people and trafﬁc, and children have to be closely watched. Many other areas in the city and the surrounding region, however, are much more suitable for them.<n>The obvious place to go is the City Park, where the zoo and Vidám Park are within a few yards of each other, and the circus makes regular appearances. The zoo as well as the amusement park are more traditional than modern, but the circus is reputedly one of Europe’s best. If the weather is warm, the splendid Széchenyi Baths is the perfect place for cooling off. In summer there’s a boating lake in the park and in winter this converts to an ice-skating rink.<n>The other oasis in the city is Margaret Island. You can spend a good hour or so riding round it en famille on a bicycle-carriage made for four. You can also swim here in the city’s biggest baths, the Palatinus Strand. Children also seem to enjoy the open-air wave pool at the Gellért Hotel. Out of town, Lake Balaton is a good place for water babies, particularly the southern edge where the sandy shore slopes gently into warm water.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhatToDo.txt
Buda Hills<n>The Buda Hills area is a greenbelt that lies due west of Rózsadomb, though it stretches as far north as Obuda and as far south as the start of the M7 highway. Choose a clear day, then catch any one of several trams or buses which go past the cog-railway terminus (just west of Moszkva tér, opposite the Hotel Budapest). There is room on the train for mountain bikes if you are feeling particularly active. The train passes smart residential houses on its way to the terminus and park of Sváb-hegy. A short walk across the park (just follow the crowds) is the stop for the Children’s Railway (Széchenyi-hegyi Gyermekvasút), thus named because it is operated almost entirely by school-children; only the engine drivers are adults.<n>This is an old narrow-gauge line which traverses seemingly unspoiled forests — but for the numerous walking trails — and climbs, slowly, ever-upwards. At the ﬁrst stop, Normafa, you’ll find a ski-run, but unless it’s snowing stay on the train until János-hegy. It is a 10–15 minute walk from here to the János-hegy lookout tower, at 529 metres (1,735 feet) the highest point in the city. If the horizon is not blurred by mist, there’s a splendid 360-degree view for mile upon mile; you can also eat here.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt

The views from the chair-lift are also spectacular, and the peace and quiet as you soar up and down the mountainside is quite extraordinary. Remember to note that the chairlift is closed on some Mondays — check with Tourinform, or go on another day. If you would prefer a speedy return to town, catch the 158 bus (to Moszkva tér) from near the bottom of the chair-lift.<n>Between the Banks<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
The centrepiece of Pest’s pedestrian zone is Váci utca (pronounced Vah-tsee utsa), the first place to visit for shopping in the city. Here you will ﬁnd the best fashion, art, cosmetics, books, and jewellery; the biggest and the best branch of Folkart (see page 78); the Pest Színház (theatre) where Franz Liszt made his city debut as a 12-year-old pianist; various airline offices, and several international organizations.<n>Váci utca runs into the ever-busy, yet somehow relaxed, Vörösmarty tér. This is one of Pest’s favourite gathering places, often lined with craft stalls and resounding to a brass band. After a browse through Luxus department store, it’s probably time for coffee and cakes at Gerbeaud, doyen of Budapest’s coffee-house scene since 1884. If the sumptuous high-ceilinged interior is a little too formal for your liking, then take a terrace seat and watch the world go by.<n>Stroll a few yards towards the river and you will come to yet another pleasant and lively square, Vigadó tér, which has the advantage of a riverside location with Castle Hill views. Here, too, you will find craft stalls and any number of buskers. A vibrant café-restaurant comprises one side of the square, but the dominant building is the splendid Vigadó theatre. The interior hall is an acoustically perfect auditorium renovated in 1980 (its predecessors having twice perished in war and revolution), but the façade has been gloriously restored in mid-19th-century Hungarian-Eastern style. The list of performers and conductors who have graced the Vigadó theatre is an impressive Who’s Who of the past 150 years of European classical music: Liszt, Brahms, Wagner, Mahler, Bartók, Prokoﬁev, Casals, Björling, and von Karajan.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
City Park (Városliget)<n>Beyond the pompous formality of Heroes’ Square and away from the noise and trafﬁc of Andrássy út, the City Park is a lovely green space where Budapestis can relax, stroll, have a meal, hire a rowing boat, go to the zoo, or visit museums. The park, which covers some 101 hectares (250 acres), began to evolve in the early 19th century, though many of the present amenities were added during preparations for the Millennium festivities of 1896.<n>Cross the bridge over the boating lake, which doubles as an ice-skating rink in winter. The Castle of Vajdahunyad, behind the lake, was built as a prop for the Millenary Exhibition but proved so popular that it was rebuilt in permanent form. It reproduces in convincing detail part of the exterior of the fairytale Hunyadi castle in Transylvania. Inside the castle is the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture, housing a comprehensive collection that illustrates the history of hunting, fishing, and farming. If you want to see the castle at its best, return by night, when it is beautifully illuminated.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
The rust-red, mid-18th-century Serbian church on the hill is only open for services, but in its grounds is the excellent Collection of Serbian Ecclesiastical Art, displaying precious carvings, icons, and manuscripts. The oldest church in the town lies just above here on top of the hill, affording a perfect vantage point from which to peer down into the tiny gardens and courtyards and across the town’s venerable rooftops.<n>The Catholic parish church dates mostly from the 13th century, though parts of it go back to the 11th century. During summer and early autumn, craft and souvenir stalls congregate around here.<n>Opposite the church is another good local artist’s collection, that of the Impressionist Béla Czóbel. You will ﬁnd much more art on display in town, but don’t miss the modern art in the Barcsay Collection (on the road out to the bus and railway station).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
Watersports<n>If you get no other exercise while you’re in California, it would be difficult to go without at least one day of swimming at the beach. It’s no coincidence that most of the United States’ champion swimmers come from Southern California. In the middle-class neighborhoods of Los Angeles county it seems that every other house has its own swimming pool — from the air you see the mass of turquoise blobs as you fly into the airport.<n>Surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, sailing, fishing, waterskiing, and windsurfing can all be enjoyed at various points on the coast. Everyone has their favorite beach or bay, and some are better for one sport than another.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhatToDo.txt
Cinema<n>In L.A., the home of the film industry, there are three big annual events: an international film festival in April, sponsored by the American Film Institute; a European film festival in June; and a festival of comic films in September. The summit of Hollywood hype and glitter is attained in late March or early April, when the Oscars, or the Academy Awards, are handed out to the film industry’s brightest lights. The ceremony takes place at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and admission is by invitation only to members of the Motion Pictures Academy, nominees, and their guests. If you’re not one of them you can still go along and watch the stars arrive.<n>For serious film-goers, the best cinemas in L.A. are around Westwood, but the old movie palaces are still running in Hollywood.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhatToDo.txt
All of California’s major cities have elegant shopping districts, but the most spectacular is Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. But L.A. has other stylish shopping districts, too: Wilshire Boulevard (ironically named after the eccentric socialist Gaylord Wilshire); Century City, near Westwood Village; Montana Avenue in Santa Monica; and Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood are among the most well-known.<n>Hollywood, not surprisingly, is the place to go if you are interested in movie memorabilia — original posters which are now valued collectors’ items, screenplays, pin-ups, biographies, and film-related books. There are also some excellent cinema bookshops along Hollywood Boulevard.<n>Flea markets are set up on the waterfront at Venice Beach and on Saturday at Pasadena’s Rose Bowl. You should also look out for the garage sales that are regularly advertised in residential areas, where families clear out any unwanted articles — everything from old tennis rackets to kitchen gadgets. You can often pick up some truly amazing bargains, as well as pieces of Americana that may mean more to foreigners than they do to their American owners.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhatToDo.txt
Start at the bridge. The city has more than one, but the one is, of course, the Golden Gate Bridge. The name Golden Gate was given to the city’s harbor entrance in 1846 by Captain John Frémont, but the mile-wide channel lay unspanned until the bridge, a masterpiece of engineering by Joseph Strauss, was completed in 1937. At 4,200 ft (1,280 m), it was the world’s longest single span until New York’s Verrazano Narrows Bridge surpassed it in 1964, but few would deny that it remains the most beautiful suspension bridge in the world. It took four years and $35 million to build; more than 40 million vehicles now cross over the span every year. You can take a bus to the bridge entrance and then walk across — it’s just as exciting an urban adventure as climbing up the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building. The bridge trembles underneath your feet, and the lamp-posts rattle as the wind whistles through swooping cables. But don’t worry — the 746-ft- (227-m-) high towers are well embedded in earthquake-proof foundations.<n>Visible in the distance is the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, known locally as just the Bay Bridge. This silver-gray structure swings across to Oakland via two suspension spans, a cantilever span, and a tunnel through Treasure Island. It’s the bridge you’ll take to go to Berkeley (see page 40) and is one of the routes to the wine country of Napa and Sonoma (see page 41).<n>Beneath the south end of the Golden Gate is Fort Point National Historic Site, the site of the brick fort built in 1857 to protect the entrance to the harbor. You can now watch surfers brave the waves here. The fort lies within the grounds of the 1,480-acre (597-hectare) Presidio, a former army post that was converted to civilian use in 1994.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_California-WhereToGo.txt
West of Mackenzie House, at the corner of Yonge and Dundas streets, is one of Toronto’s shopping “musts,” the Eaton Centre. The late-20th-century phenomenon of the giant mall becomes here a spectacular showcase of galleries under an arched glass roof, with fiberglass geese suspended in a refreshing décor of greenery and flowers.<n>West of Nathan Phillips Square, beyond tree-lined lawns, is Osgoode Hall, a true jewel of Georgian architecture in white limestone and amber brick, and the seat, since 1832, of the Law Society of Upper Canada. Notice the beautiful wrought-iron “cow gates” put up at the main entrance to keep the cattle out in those early rural days. It may whet your appetite to see a couple of other gracious relics of the Georgian era inside. Visit Campbell House (1822) on the northwest corner of Queen and University Streets. Guides in Colonial Dames’ costumes will show you around the home of Sir William Campbell, Chief Justice of Upper Canada in the 1820s. The Grange can be reached through the basement of the Art Gallery of Ontario (see page 59) at Grange Park. There, costumed guides will help to give you a sense of the grand life enjoyed by members of the much admired and hated Family Compact. The Boultons built this country mansion in 1817, when its grounds stretched more than 3 km (2 miles) from Queen clear up to Bloor Street. Note the fine winding staircase, statuary, and stained-glass windows. Be sure to go downstairs, too, to visit the spacious kitchens. On McCaul Street, across from the Art Gallery, the Village by the Grange tries to recreate something of this old world atmosphere for its boutiques and restaurants.<n>Queen’s Park and Yorkville<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Mere statistics — an average of 2,830 cubic m (100,000 cubic ft) of water per second generating 4 million kilowatts of energy — convey nothing of the falls’ immensity, but a close-up view is unforgettable. The Niagara River divides in fact into two major cascades around Goat Island: to the east, American Falls (61 m/184 ft high with a crestline of 350 m/1,076 ft) and to the west, the more dramatic Canadian Horseshoe Falls (58 m/177 ft high with a curving crestline of 670 m/2,214 ft), and a smaller cascade off to the side, known as Bridal Veil.<n>There are several vantage points from which to view the Falls. Table Rock, named after a ledge that’s long since fallen in the river, is right on the brink of Horseshoe Falls. Down below, the Table Rock Scenic Tunnels take you behind the mighty wall of water. With the price of the ticket, you borrow some protective clothing, but nothing is totally waterproof against Niagara. Don’t let that worry you — seeing Niagara and not getting wet would be silly. Just keep a dry change of clothing in the car. A boat tour below the falls in one of the three vessels that go by the name of Maid of the Mist takes you past and damply close to both falls. The Spanish Aero cable car gives you a bird’s-eye view of the Niagara Whirlpool rapids. For an overall view, try the Skylon and Minolta towers.<n>Away from the hustle and hype, Queen Victoria Park is a delight for hikers, cyclists, and picnickers — even cross-country skiers in winter, when the falls take on a much more romantic look, all the more so for being relatively deserted. In spring, the park gardens put on a magnificent show of daffodils, tulips, magnolias, and roses, and diners in the park restaurant get a great view of the falls’ nighttime illuminations.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
“Bald point,” as French explorers dubbed it, is the southern half of a 20-km (12-mile) sandspit jutting out into Lake Erie. Its terrain is a mixture of marshland, forest, meadows, and sandy beaches. Beginning with a lookout tower for bird-watchers, a circular boardwalk takes you out onto the marshes to observe the flight of the redwing blackbird and purple martin, while bittern stay tucked away in the reeds. Look, too, for the pretty pink-blossomed swamp rose-mallow, unique to Point Pelee. Well-marked bicycle and hiking trails wind through the woods, where you’ll see hackberry, sassafras, sycamore, black walnut, and red cedar, many of the trees draped with hanging vines reminiscent of the American Carolinas.<n>In the spring, the great sport is fishing for smelt during their spawning run, ending the day with a communal fish-fry on the beach. In September, even before the leaves turn, trees go bright orange with the wings of millions of Monarch butterflies on their way to Mexico.<n>Lakes Huron and Superior<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Sparks Street Mall, the first street in Ottawa to be paved and then the city’s, indeed the country’s, first traffic-free pedestrian zone, is a pleasant shopping area enlivened by street musicians and clowns and bordered by some first-class modern office buildings. Pride of place goes to the elegant 12-story mirror-glass Bank of Canada (between Kent and Bank Streets) by Arthur Erickson. The green patina of the building’s copper skeleton is an artful homage to the copper roofs on the old Parliament Buildings. Inside is the Currency Museum (see page 78). On the vast three-sided Confederation Square — popularly known for its traffic congestion as “Confusion Square” — notice the great granite arch of the National War Memorial, with its statues of 22 World War I soldiers and a horse-drawn cannon. Ironically, it was dedicated by George VI just three months before the outbreak of World War II. The square’s bunker-like National Arts Centre (1969) houses the capital’s ballet, opera, and theater, but it’s the summer beer-garden overlooking the Rideau Canal that is the most popular attraction. Getting a federal government’s priorities in proper perspective, one member of parliament bemoaned the cultural center as “50 years ahead of its time — that’s how long it’ll take the taxpayers to meet the 500 percent cost overrun.” The formidable Château Laurier, (1912) a railway hotel on the north side of the square, is built in the Renaissance castle style much favored by the C.P.R. and C.N.R. for their luxury transcontinental hostelries. Local citizens boast that the Rideau Canal, which stretches 200 km (120 miles) from the Ottawa River to Lake Ontario, qualifies in winter as “the world’s longest skating rink.” In summer, it offers delightful boat cruises and canoeing, or you can explore its banks with a rented bicycle.<n>On the edge of the parliamentary district, across the Rideau Canal, is Byward Market (one block east of Sussex Drive and north of Rideau Street). Since 1846, when it was a clearing house for nearby farmers, this has been the popular center of town, meeting place for the non-politicos. In its jolly, well-restored state, only one of the market stalls dates as far back as 1867, but the market retains much of its 19th-century atmosphere. Quite apart from the colorful stalls of fruit and vegetables, it’s a great place for breakfast, open even on Sundays in a town that otherwise closes down when the bureaucrats go home.<n>Sussex Drive<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Thousand Islands<n>Reached most easily from Kingston, this archipelago of, in fact, 1,700 islands are strung out along the St. Lawrence River for nearly 80 km (48 miles). You can go fishing, sailing, or lie back and enjoy a luxury three-day cruise around the islands aboard the Empress steamboat.<n>The island scenery is another painter’s delight — the dark green of the spruces and silver birches against grey-and-pink granite outcrops. Millionaires such as songwriter Irving Berlin and cosmetic queen Helena Rubinstein made this their playground with hideaway mansions known as “cottages.” One that escapes that euphemism is Boldt’s Castle, the kind of Gothic folly that magnates liked to dabble in earlier this century. In this case, it was George Boldt, the German owner of New York’s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He built it for his wife but she died before it was finished, and it was abandoned as a vast empty fortress, like those that Boldt admired in similar splendid ruin back home in the Rhine Valley.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
New Brunswick<n>With a rugged coastline and an interior covered 85% by forest, the province is popular with nature-loving campers in general and fishermen and hunters in particular. Anglers can hope for trout, bass, pickerel, and salmon, while hunters go for the duck and grouse. Wildlife enthusiasts may also spot red deer, black bear, and moose in the forests. The Bay of Fundy’s 16 m (50 ft) high tides produce remarkable effects in the river estuaries and along the coast.<n>Linked to Nova Scotia by the narrow Chignecto Isthmus, New Brunswick became a separate province in 1784 at the demand of 14,000 Loyalist refugees. It took its name from the German duchy then ruled by George III of England. The Loyalists joined earlier settlers from New England, Pennsylvania, and Yorkshire, and French Acadians who had trickled back after their deportation during the Anglo-French wars. Today, one-third of the population is French-speaking, the rest English.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Safely up on a hill on Military Road, the Catholic Basilica of St. John the Baptist (1850) escaped the numerous fires to dominate the town’s skyline with its granite and limestone towers. Down on Gower Street, the Anglican Cathedral, also named after John the Baptist, burned down twice, and its simple Neo-Gothic 20th-century version is still without a steeple.<n>For the best view of the harbor go up to Signal Hill, looking over the narrows and out to the Atlantic Ocean. The hill was fortified to guard the harbor entrance during the Napoleonic Wars, and you can still see cannon of the Queen’s Battery, installed in 1796. The Cabot Tower atop the hill was built in 1897, fourth centenary of Cabot’s landing and diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria. Four years later, at 12:30pm, December 12, 1901, in a receiving station improvised near the tower in a hospital (burned down in 1920), Guglielmo Marconi suddenly yelled: “Do you hear that? Do you hear that?” What the Italian inventor was so excited about were three faint dots of the letter S in Morse, from his transmitter in Poldhu, Cornwall. The group of dour Newfie fishermen listening in were more impressed by this fellow jumping up and down than by history’s first transatlantic radio message. The event is commemorated by a modest exhibit in the Cabot Tower.<n>On the north side of the hill, Quidi Vidi (pronounced Kiddy Viddy) is a charming little fishing port with excellent seafood restaurants. On the first Wednesday in August, St. John’s Regatta, a race for six-oar rowing boats, is held on Quidi Vidi Lake. Begun in the 1820s, this oldest continuing sporting event in North America is also the occasion of a boisterous carnival.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Cross the First Narrows on Lions Gate Bridge and take the Capilano Road for a cable-car ride, “Skyride,” up to Grouse Mountain and its grand view south over the city and harbor. Try to be there at sunset, too, to see the city light up. A favorite with skiers, the mountain also offers a fine view northwest over Capilano Lake and across to Vancouver Island. If you feel like a quick whiff of the wilderness on your way back, turn off to walk the swaying suspension bridge 76 m (230 ft) above the fast-flowing waters of Capilano Canyon.<n>To get an equally impressive view of the city set against its mountains, go downtown to the observation deck (and its restaurant, if you like) on top of the 40-story Harbour Centre (555 West Hastings Street). A bonus on clear days is a view south, with the long-range telescope, of Mount Baker across the American border in the state of Washington.<n>You’ll find the information office of Tourism British Columbia, at 865 Hornby Street, useful for details about the province. For the city, Greater Vancouver Convention & Visitors Bureau is at 200 Burrard Street, Plaza Level.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
Yellowknife<n>On the north shore of Great Slave Lake, the territorial capital is a modern industrial gold-mining center serving as a convenient base from which campers and fishermen explore the interior. On June 21, when the sun just won’t go down, the town proposes a golfer’s (and caddy’s) midsummer night’s dream with the Midnight Golf Tournament. Even non-golfers pour in for the all-night parties. All through the summer, there is open-air theater in Petitot Park,<n>To gain an insight into the lives of Arctic-dwelling Inuit and Dene Indians of the Mackenzie Valley, visit Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre. In the shops, the native craftwork is of particularly high (and authentic) quality, and reasonably priced.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Canada-WhereToGo.txt
There are several approaches to Las Cañadas National Park and Mount Teide. The park is well sign-posted from the road via La Orotava, but if you are coming from the north, then the most picturesque route is via La Esperanza. The small town soon gives way to a lush forest of giant pines and eucalyptus trees. Four km (21⁄2 miles) south at Las Raíces is where Franco met with his co-conspirators in 1936 (see page 20). An obelisk in the forest commemorates the event. As the road gains altitude and temperatures fall, the views become ever more spectacular. The Mirador Pico de las Flores looks out over to the southeast and the Mirador de Ortuño offers a panorama of the northern coast. Highest of all at over 2,000 m (6,562 ft), Mirador las Cumbres reveals Teide in all her glory.<n>The entrance to the National Park is El Portillo de las Cañadas, where there is a visitor center (open daily 9am–4pm). If you wish to walk in the park, pick up a leaflet or ask for information about the daily guided walks. Note that during winter the environment can become quite harsh, and you should never undertake walks without consulting staff at the visitor center first. At this point it is quite likely that you will be in the clouds; temperatures are very low, and in winter there may well be snow on the ground. The landscape becomes very lunar-like; it was around here that some of the filming for Planet of the Apes took place. The ascent to the top of Mount Teide can be made by climbing, or by the new cable car (teleférico), an eight-minute ride (open daily 9am–4pm, admission: 2,500 ptas, r15.03). Most visitors choose the cable car, but it’s worth noting that even after leaving the cable car it is still a good climb to the summit at 3,717 m (12,195 ft). However, if you really want to venture that far you have to go in person and with a photocopy of your passport, to the Office of the Parque Nacional del Teide (Calle Emilio Calzadilla, 5, 38002 Santa Cruz de Tenerife). Even then, there is a daily limit of just 50 people, for conservation sake, allowed up the last 200 m (219 yards) to the summit. Once there, you should be able to count off all the other Canary Islands and, on a good day, see North Africa. Impressive as Teide is, it is basically no more than a peak on the edge of a giant volcano which long ago erupted or imploded. Left behind is the vast Caldera (volcanic crater) which is most apparent from the area known as Los Roques. Los Roques are a group of giant, flamboyantly shaped lumps of volcanic rock rising out of the crater; often visited and photographed.<n>The East and South Coast<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
Population: 17,000<n>La Gomera is, indeed, a dramatic and rugged mountainous island. It has a coastline that is dominated by dramatic cliffs — there are very few beaches, and the interior is full of vertiginous, mostly verdant, valleys that are often lined with narrow fields stepped into the sides of the mountains. For extra effect these valleys are more often than not covered by a ceiling of cloud, whisked in by the trade winds, which seem to perpetually hang over the island. In the center, there is the unusually dense growth of trees and fauna in what is the Parque Nacional Garajonay (open Tuesday–Sunday 9:30am–4:30pm). Less than 20 km (121⁄2 miles) from north to south, this amazing island has been declared a Property of Humanity by UNESCO. In fact, a third of the island, 12,450 hectares (30,774 acres) has been designated into seventeen protected areas. Such terrain, though, makes for difficulty in getting around, and even the Romans, had they ventured this way, would have found their legendary ability to build straight roads put to an impossible test. In fact, almost nowhere on the island will you find a straight stretch of road, everywhere you go the roads twist and turn continually, often turning back on themselves in hairpin bends. Making driving even more complicated is the fact that the roads, although improving, are often of poor quality, and the directional signs leave much to be desired.<n>Just 40 minutes away from Tenerife, La Gomera nevertheless remains unspoiled and authentic, with its steep, green, terraced hills and tranquil valleys.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
This is really of little interest, and the roads often leave something to be desired. However, a trip up the eastern coast from Santa Cruz to just south of Barlovento isn’t too long, and the rather serpentine road runs through some pretty scenery. Make the first stop the miradores of Bartolomé and La Montaña, with the latter being a little higher and affording beautiful vistas along the coast in both directions. Head next for the seaside village of San Andrés and its natural swimming pools at Charco Azul (blue pool). A little inland from San Andrés and Sauces is the Bosque de Los Tilos, the largest wooded area in the whole Canary Islands and designated a “Biosphere Reserve” under the protection of UNESCO. Heritage of Mankind is the information center above the restaurant (open Monday–Friday 8am–3pm). The final destination though is a lovely, remote site just before Barlovento where, after a tortuously twisting journey down through banana plantations, you will reach the Piscinas Fajana; literally swimming pools built into the rocks and fed by the ocean waters that often crash into them. Showers and toilets are on hand, as is the pleasant La Gaviota (the Seagull), a restaurant/bar, and the views north of the cliffs falling straight into the ocean and being pounded by waves are breathtaking.<n>The goal in the north for most travelers is the Roque de los Muchachos, the highest point in the island at 2,423 m (7,950 ft) above sea level. There are several ways up to it, but always be aware of the weather; what looks fine from sea level takes on a different perspective at nearly 2,438 m (8,000 ft). And, of course, it can change dramatically and quickly, so go prepared clothes-wise, and know that you might not see much but clouds. Besides the views, the other attraction up here is the futuristic Observatoria de Astrofísica, regarded as the most important observatory in the Northern Hemisphere and home to some of the world’s most important telescopes, including the 4-m (165-inch) William Herschel telescope. However, as it is only open to visitors for a few days each summer, most will have to be satisfied with just seeing it from the outside.<n>PROVINCE OF LAS PALMAS de GRAN CANARIA:<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
The newly created resort of Playa Blanca on the south coast, the third major tourist center on the island, is host to the Fuerteventura ferry, a marina and a good golden beach. However, just a few miles east along unpaved roads are the best sands on the island, collectively known as the Papagayo (parrot) beaches. You will need a four-wheel-drive vehicle, local directions (there are no signposts), and little else, as on Papagayo naturism is the norm. The Ganges Seis is a taxi boat that will drop you off there in the morning and return to pick you up in the afternoon. An alternate way to get there is to take the Catlanza s.l. a modern catamaran that sails out of Puerto Calero — the highlight is when it drops anchor 46 m (50 yards) off the Papagayo beach.<n>Puerto Calero, just a few minutes south of Puerto del Carmen, but with an entirely different ambiance, is a rather new and dominated by its modern marina that is lined by a row of restaurants offering all kinds of cuisine. Besides the Catlanza catamaran it is also the home port of Submarine Safaris which offers the opportunity to explore under the local waters. The trip that lasts one hour, and when it settles onto the seabed 30 m (33 yards) or so down, divers go out to feed the fish.<n>The highlight of your trip to Lanzarote and the magical ingredient that makes this island so special is to be found in the Montañas del Fuego (Mountains of Fire). The Parque Nacional de Timanfaya, which encompasses the mountains in its 200 square km (77.2 square miles), starts just north of Yaiza, and its boundary is marked by an impish devil motif. This desolate national park was formed largely over the course of 16 cataclysmic months during 1730 and 1731. Eleven villages were buried forever and many of the people left the island for Gran Canaria.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
The main attraction is the 26-km- (16-mile-) long sandy shores of Jandía that run from the narrowest part of Fuerteventura down to Morro Jable. At the northern tip of the Jandía sands are the beautiful beaches of Costa Calma, not blighted as yet by over-development. Here, a low cliff backing and a scattering of rocks and coves give the beach far more character than some of the seemingly endless stretches farther south.<n>The Playa de Sotavento is world-famous as a windsurfing center, with activity focused on the F2 school at the Sol Elite Gorriones Hotel. This has one of the best, and most isolated beach locations in all of the islands. Here the beach is very wide and flat, usually empty and, as the tides go out, also very wet. The dunes behind and a little farther to the south form an idyllic beach backdrop. Urbanizaciones spread relentlessly all the way down the coast to Morro Jable, which has some similarities with its northern sister Corralejo; both are ports and resorts, but in most other aspects are quite dissimilar. Whereas Corralejo is flat, rather dingy, without many hotels and restaurants of much class, and doesn’t have much of its own beach, Morro Jable, built along the cliffs, is bright and airy, boasts numerous fine hotels and restaurants, and has miles of wonderful beaches. It is interesting to note that while Corralejo is a mainly British resort Morro Jable, on the other hand, is frequented predominantly by Germans. There are more fine beaches towards the southern tip of the island, but you will need a four-wheel-drive vehicle to get there. Jable, incidentally, is the name given to the huge quantities of sands of organic origins that are frequently blown to the surrounding beaches. Windsurfing, obviously, is all the rage around here, and numerous companies operate in and around Morro Jable and the other beaches of Jandía. The Diving Center Félix (3 Km {2 miles} north of Morro Jable) offers dives and equipment rental. Consider Unisafari; based in either Jandía or Corralejo, whose professional guides will take you on a seven-hour jeep safari to the most wild, least explored parts of the island.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
The following are two reputable local dive centers: Diving Adventures, Calle 5 Sur #22, Cozumel; Tel. 87/2-3009; <www.divingadventures.net>. Scuba Cancún, km 5 Paseo Kukulkán, lagoon side, Cancún; Tel. 98/83-1011; fax 98/84-2336.<n>It is also possible to dive and swim in cenotes, sinkholes found in the sub-surface limestone layer of the Yucatán peninsula, caused by millions of years of erosion. The Maya considered them to be holy places because they were the only source of fresh water other than what fell from the sky; for this reason, Mayan artifacts have been found in many cenotes. The holes provide an environment for turtles, eels, and a variety of tropical fish. Swimming in the cool, fresh water of the cenotes (a nice change from the salt water of the sea) is great fun. Cenote diving is only for the experienced. Always go through a reputable dive company; the companies listed above will offer further advice.<n>Snorkeling<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhatToDo.txt
Entertainment<n>Once the sun goes down, Cancún gears up. There’s no shortage of places to go or things to do, and no need to take a long novel to fill those quiet moments — there just won’t be any. Many people don’t take to their beds until they’ve seen the sun come up. If you choose to stay in Mujeres or Cozumel, things will be a bit more laid back. The diving fraternity tends to enjoy low-key, less glamorous entertainment and relatively early nights before they head under the waves early the following day.<n>Before you head straight into the resort atmosphere of Cancún, check out what’s happening in your hotel. Many have “Las Vegas style” floor shows, Mexican evenings with traditional folk music and dances, and clubs where you can take to the dance floor yourself.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhatToDo.txt
Finding your way around the resort couldn’t be simpler. There is only one main thoroughfare, Kukulkán Boulevard, running the full length of the island, and every hotel and attraction is only a few strides from it. The addresses of most hotels or restaurants will include their position on Kukulkán Boulevard in kilometers; the farther south, the bigger the number. This guide explores the island from north to south, giving the exact location of attractions in kilometers to make it easy for you to find what you need. You could rent a vehicle of some sort to travel back and forth to your hotel, but there is a very reliable and inexpensive bus service stopping regularly, and usually directly outside the major hotels, at intervals along the route. The buses run from early morning to midnight.<n>Crossing from the mainland onto the island — into the area called the Hotel Zone — the lagoon with its rich mangrove forest is on the right. You may see a passing pleasure-boat on the water, or a jet-ski convoy on the lookout for wildlife such as herons, pelicans, deer, wild boar, even the occasional crocodile — though the local creatures tend to only be found in the most remote parts of the mangrove, well away from humans. Between the lagoon and the road is a narrow grassy area called the Parque de las Artes, with topiary and large boulders sitting on the pristine lawns, and shaded seats where you can relax and watch the world go by. If you’re feeling a bit more energetic, on the left of the road there is a wide cycling, in-line skating, and jogging track for much of the length of the island.<n>This part of Cancún has the calmest sea for swimming and snorkeling, lying as it does in the shelter of Isla Mujeres just offshore. At km 3.5 you’ll find Playa Linda Marine Terminal, where a number of pleasure craft leave for trips to Isla Mujeres or sunset cruises. One, the Captain Hook, resembles a pirate ship; shipmates play games while sailing the high seas. At km 5 you will pass a huge Mexican flag, one of only seven this size in the whole country. You can see it from most points on the island; it is only taken down in high winds. Just beyond the flag on the left is Tortuga Pier, hosting boating trips and the ferry terminal, plus access to Playa Tortuga beach. Kilometer 7 sees a right turn to the 18-hole Pok-Ta-Pok golf course, which is located on a large land-mass that juts out into the lagoon.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
The Spanish conducted the first Catholic mass in Mexico here after their arrival in 1518, but they had little interest in the island. It remained almost uninhabited through the 18th century. But following the War of the Castes in 1847–1848, several rebel families settled here to escape retribution by colonial landowners on the Yucatecan mainland. They eked out a simple living for decades until the invention of the scuba tank. And the rest, as they say, is history!<n>Cozumel has multiple personalities; it caters to divers who go to bed early and rise with the sun, yet it also has occasionally raucous nightlife for those who want to stay out and party. Those who know the island well refer to this phenomenon as the “wet” side and the “dry” side. Day-trippers who arrive on their huge floating cruise ships — or on daily ferries from Playa del Carmen — add an extra dimension; they want to see everything in a few hours, so the slow routine of island life speeds up when they arrive.<n>There is only one settlement, the capital, on Cozumel, San Miguel de Cozumel; it’s a bustling town chock-full of souvenir shops, duty-free emporiums, bars, and assorted cafés and restaurants. If you arrive on the island by ferry from the mainland, you’ll be dropped off directly opposite the heart of the downtown area, Plaza del Sol, also called the zócalo. This large, tree-lined square is where everyone meets for coffee, or lunch at one of the cafés nearby. Several streets surrounding the square are traffic-free, and you can stroll at your leisure among the stores selling T-shirts, pottery, onyx, and silver. The storeowners have a practiced line and can be pretty persuasive, so it pays to have a sense of humor — or a few words of Spanish so you can join in the banter.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
Concerts and Ballet<n>During the Cultural Revolution, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky were banned and many musicians banished to the countryside for “re-education.” So if you go to a concert today, you’ll sense the drama of recovery from mad xenophobia. This needn’t obscure the fact that some professional musicians haven’t yet reached world standards. But the enthusiasm of players and audience is exciting in itself.<n>Ballet, a vehicle for ideological indoctrination during the 1960s and 1970s, is much less restricted today. Folk legends are often a source of inspiration, and classical European works are sometimes performed, with elaborate costumes, sets, and lighting effects.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhatToDo.txt
Less taxing would be a week in and around Shanghai, emphasizing the legendary charms of Wuxi, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. All three towns are on the historic Grand Canal.<n>If you go inland, you can still take the celebrated four-day boat trip between Wuhan and Chongqing through the Yangzi (Yangtze) River gorges (before they are swallowed up by a massive dam project to be completed after 2009), and from there fly to Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangzhou for sightseeing, shopping, and gourmet dining.<n>Silk Road enthusiasts fly from Beijing or Xi’an to Urumqi in the far west, returning via the exotic desert oases of Turpan and Dunhuang for the Buddhist cave treasures and camel rides to sand-locked lakes.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Mostly the city is flat, which is a mercy for the millions who bicycle to work in the world’s most unlikely rush hour, a chaos of buses and trucks and more bikes than you’ve seen in your whole life. In 1998, Beijing took the unthinkable step of actually banning bikes from one street, Xisidonglu, where bicycle flow had reached more than 100 per minute.<n>In the Middle Ages, the emperors decided to do something about the capital’s unrelieved flatness. They ordered hills to be artificially constructed just north of the Forbidden City so they could go up and, in total privacy, enjoy a summer breeze and a bird’s-eye view over the curved tile roofs of their imperial compound. Try it yourself, perhaps at dawn, when a thin haze drapes itself over the pavilions, redefining yet softening the features of this storybook skyline. You’ll see why the emperors wanted it all for themselves.<n>Beijing in History<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Changsha<n>If you go to Changsha by train, you will arrive at the second biggest railway station in China, a distinction quite out of proportion to the amount of rail traffic or the size of the city. The explanation is that, until the late 1970s, legions of pilgrims converged on this provincial capital in search of the roots of Chairman Mao Zedong. Now that the cult of Mao has faded in glory, the stations and the shrines are uncrowded and Changsha has returned to its age-old role as a rather prosaic regional center of trade and culture. However, the surrounding fertile countryside is attractive, the spicy Hunan cuisine is worth trying, the scenic mountain areas of the province are outstanding, and the archaeological displays are stunning.<n>The capital of Hunan Province, Changsha lies along the Xiang River, a wide and often turbulent stream that flows into the Yangzi. The long thin strip of Orange Island (Juzizhou), rich in oranges among other crops, bisects the river and in the early 20th century was home to a small band of Western traders and missionaries. From the pavilion at the southern tip there is an engrossing view of sampans, barge trains, and passenger ships. On the far side of the river, fragrant forests climb the slopes of Yuelu Hill, a favorite escape from the subtropical heat of the city in summer. One of the evergreen trees in the mountainside Lushan Temple is more than 1,700 years old. The Qing Dynasty pavilion on top (Yunlugong) affords a fine panorama.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Visitors enter this royal resort at the ceremonial Lizheng Gate, flanked by two marble lions. The old palace and royal halls now serve as museums. Among the exhibits are bows and arrows and Chinese flintlocks, rare jade and porcelain, and the sedan chairs in which the emperors were transported all the way from Beijing. The emperor’s bedroom is located in the Refreshing Mist-Veiled Waters Pavilion. The halls and courtyards are eminently regal, yet they also inspire a feeling of relaxation appropriate to the setting. The plain wooden corridors connecting the buildings contrast with the illustrated passageways of Beijing’s Summer Palace, which occupies but half the space of the Chengde retreat.<n>The landscape beyond the palace compound features many of the romantic elements of Chinese tradition: interconnected lakes and lotus ponds, forests, causeways and arched bridges, ornate pavilions, and towering pagodas. The Tower of Mist and Rain (Yanyulou), a two-story lakeside pavilion in the southern style, was favored by emperors for its foggy views resembling those of an old Chinese painting. Tourists can cross the lakes in hand-poled ferryboats or drift at their own pace in a rowing boat. North of the lakes there are hiking trails in the Garden of Ten Thousand Trees (Wanahuyuan), where Emperor Qianlong gave an audience in 1793 to the first British ambassador to set foot in China, Lord Macartney. The meeting did not go well.<n>Beyond the wall surrounding the palace and its gardens rise the exotic roofs of the Eight Outer Temples, built by the emperors between 1713 and 1779 to honor and influence Tibetans, Kazakhs, and other northern peoples. All are open to tourists. The two grandest temples are Tibetan in style. The Mount Sumera Longevity and Happiness Temple (Xumifushoumiao) is a copy of the sixth Panchen Lama’s residence in Shigatse, Tibet. The high red walls surround a pavilion with a roof gilded in a ton of gold. A mile east, the Small Potala Temple (Putuozongshengmiao), the largest at Chengde, evokes the Dalai Lama’s Potala Palace in Lhasa and is so steep a climb (164 steps) that sedan-chair carriers do a brisk trade with weary tourists.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
Yangzi River Cruise<n>China’s most exciting boat trip is the Yangzi River cruise through the spectacular Three Gorges (Sanxia). It takes at least three days to go downriver from Chongqing to Wuhan, and as many as five days in the reverse direction, bucking the considerable tide. Until relatively recently the trip was considered an extended, risky adventure. The most awesome scenery is concentrated between the Sichuan city of Baidi and Nanjin Pass in Hubei Province. The sight of the Yangzi water rushing between the sheer walls and evocative rock formations never fails to stir the traveler’s spirit.<n>In 1992 the National People’s Congress passed a resolution to launch the massive Three Gorges Hydropower Project, including the construction of a huge dam and a reservoir, slated for completion sometime after the year 2009, which will submerge the most scenic sections of the river.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
The town, capital of the Bai Autonomous Region, has sections of a medieval wall with formal gates on the north and south ends. Within the walls are a few intersecting main streets whose tile-roofed shops and houses now serve as souvenir shops, private travel agencies, hostels, and — above all — small, intimate, friendly cafés serving a truly international mix of inexpensive dishes.<n>The café life in Dali is one of its chief delights. Cafés are perfect spots to wile away the sunny hours over coffee or beer or to meet local Bai people as well as other travelers. Perhaps the most famous of the dozens of cafés is Mr. China Son’s Cultural Exchange Café, run by Uncle Li (Heliyi), the first Bai in history to go abroad. His autobiography, on sale at his café, is an epic soap opera.<n>Dali also has sights and attractions well worth attending to when the café and bistro scene begins to pale. Erhai Lake is a 30-minute walk from town, and its main village, Caicun, is a maze of unpaved alleys and mud houses. Ferries cross the lake to even more remote villages, including the temple dedicated to Guanyin (goddess of mercy) on Putuo Island. Any of dozens of local travel agents can quickly arrange an excursion to lakeside villages, including the market at Wase. One popular diversion is the Monday morning outdoor market at Shaping, 30 minutes up the eucalyptus-lined road by minibus from Dali. It’s a vast market of country wares, batik, and horse-trading, with hundreds of locals dressed in their traditional bright Bai jackets, tunics, and plumed caps.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
On the River<n>The transcendent tourist experience of Guilin — and perhaps of all China — is a boat trip on the Li River. The karst scenery could hardly be more romantic. But life along the river is also fascinating: washerwomen squatting on the shore, water buffalo ambling down for a dip, the improvised ferryboats, and the captive cormorant birds, their necks ringed to prevent them from swallowing all their catch, waiting for orders to go fishing from bamboo rafts.<n>Large, flat-bottomed tour boats usually leave early in the morning from the quay near the Liberation Bridge in central Guilin. (In the dry season, when the river is at its lowest, the first part of the journey must be undertaken by coach.) With room for more than 100 passengers each, most of these vessels are quiet and serve a lunch cooked en route.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
West Lake<n>For a full panorama of West Lake and the city, go up to the viewing platforms at a pavilion atop Wu Hill (Wushan), south of the lake. The hilltop is richly forested with gingko, maple, and camphor trees. Another vista spot is located on the summit of the hill on the north side of the lake, where the hauntingly beautiful Baochu Pagoda stands. But the beauty of the lake can best be appreciated at close range: from the deck of a sightseeing boat or from the paths and causeways along its shore. The lake edge is abundantly supplied with flowers, trees, and (unusual in China) secluded places where lovers can find privacy.<n>The highlight of a boat trip across West Lake is the largest of three man-made islands, a “small fairy island” known as Three Pools Mirroring the Moon (Santan Yinyue). The island, created in the Ming Dynasty, was ingeniously provided with an island of its own, in the center of its own lake. A zigzag bridge will get you there. Three small stone pagodas, rebuilt in the 17th century, rise from the main lake just south of the isle. On the night of the Moon Festival, candles are placed inside the pagodas. The flickering light emanating from the small round windows gives the lake 15 reflections imitating the real moon.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
The Gansu Provincial Museum (Sheng Bowuguan), just across the street from the big Soviet-style Huaiyi Hotel, houses Silk Road treasures and perhaps the most famous sculpture in all of China, the galloping “Flying Horse of Gansu.” With its right rear leg touching a symbolic bird, the Gansu horse is the subject of countless reproductions at home and abroad. The original bronze was found in an ancient Han Dynasty tomb in Gansu Province in 1969. You can buy a bronze copy in the museum shop — for a tidy sum.<n>For a view of the muddy, swiftly moving Yellow River and the city along its banks, go along to White Pagoda Hill Park (Baitashan Gongyuan), once a military stronghold. The temple itself, an octagonal seven-tier structure, was rebuilt in the 15th century. Five Springs Hill Park (Wuquanshan Gongyuan) climbs a steep mountainside on the opposite bank of the river. The springs provide water for various needs, from making tea to ensuring fertility. To break up the climb there are temples and pavilions to visit and a big pond crossed by a crooked bridge. The temples date from the 14th century; one artifact, a 5-ton bronze bell, was cast in 1202.<n>West of Lanzhou are the magnificent Thousand Buddha Temple and Caves (Binglingsi Shiku), with ancient frescoes and hundreds of statues, and, at Xiahe, the Labrang Monastery (Labolengsi), one of the largest and most active lamaseries outside of Tibet. Southeast of Lanzhou, requiring an overnight visit, is one of the most celebrated of the great Buddhist grottoes, the Maijishan Caves (Maijishan Shiku), dating back to the fourth century.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
For centuries Suzhou has been famous for its canals and gardens, its beautiful women, and the musical cadences of the local dialect. An old Chinese proverb, referring to the area’s linguistic charms, claims that even an argument in Suzhou sounds sweeter than flattery in Guangzhon. Marco Polo found the inhabitants better traders than warriors, and he described the city as large and magnificent. So much silk was produced, he reported, that every citizen was clothed in it and the surplus was exported. Even today, silk still retains its significance in the local economy.<n>Whether you go to Suzhou from Shanghai or Nanjing, you will be moved by the wayside scenery, typical of China’s “land of fish and rice.” Sampans and scows ply the canals that divide the farmlands, where barefoot peasants in straw coolie hats squelch through the muddy rice fields. The Grand Canal is crowded with strings of barges laden with fruit and vegetables, construction materials, or coal. Suzhou in fact means “Plentiful Water.”<n>The Grand Canal, second only to the Great Wall as a Chinese engineering achievement, was started 2,400 years ago. By the sixth century it linked Suzhou and other rich farming areas of the south with the consumers of the north — most notably the emperor and his court, who appreciated receiving fresh food regardless of the season. Canal excursions by tourist boat often begin in Suzhou, continuing to another enchanted city, Wuxi (see page 173).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_China-WhereToGo.txt
The best known traditional dances on the Costa Blanca are the jota valenciana and jota murciana. Sets of vivacious performers either dance alone facing a partner or in pairs. Their steps can be vigorous or stately and gracious.<n>The dancers are accompanied by musicians playing the guitar or instruments introduced into the region by the Moors — the dulzaina (flute) and tamboril (tambourine). The rhythms go all the way back to the Iberians and reflect a diversity of influences, from Moorish to Aragonese and Castilian to Cuban.<n>Both old and young take part, attesting to the growing revival of interest in Spain’s rich heritage of traditional dance and music.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
The rivers of the Costa Blanca region may reveal carp and barbel, but don’t expect much excitement. The best freshwater fishing hereabouts is the Amadorio Dam, 4 km (21⁄2 miles) from Villajoyosa (see page 34) and, to a lesser extent, Guadalest’s dam. They hold barbel, the biggest carp, smallish black bass, and rainbow trout — introduced in 1977 and still protected. To catch them you’ll need a licence with a trout supplement. The season for non-mountain trout runs from the first Sunday in March to 15 August. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries oversees licences.<n>If you go sea fishing, you will need local knowledge to hook big grey mullet, sea bream, bass, and maybe even grouper below quiet cliffs, and mackerel two or three miles out. In summer, you may catch the tasty dorada; in late summer, autumn, and winter, various species of tuna and swordfish.<n>Tennis<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Horseback Riding<n>For centuries, horseback riding has been a Spanish speciality. One kind of ranch, catering to the resort trade, provides a quiet seaside jog. The other offers good horses, skilled instruction, and interesting cross-country riding. For the experienced and saddle-fit, there are also mountain treks of up to five days, for instance via Altea’s Río Algar, or from La Sella, near La Jara. These treks go through orange, almond, and olive groves, past gaunt carob trees, across rivers, and up through pine forests and open moors to real Sierra country.<n>Alternatively, it is possible for inexperienced riders to join other tourists on horseback for a moonlight excursion, with a barbecue at the end of an easy ride: it’s an excellent way to meet people.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Hunting and Shooting<n>Spain has always been famously rich in hunting and shooting possibilities, from wolf to wild boar — though the Costa Blanca is hardly the place for it. Tourist offices have a brochure, “Caza,” which gives more information about where to go for good hunting and how to obtain the necessary permits.<n>Shopping<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Shopping<n>You will often find the Costa Blanca’s best buys off the main streets or in the markets. For the greatest variety and lowest overall prices, shop in the side streets of Alicante. For special items, go inland to the place of manufacture, keeping in mind the prices asked on the coast and at home: Guadalest for ponchos and shawls; Gata for cane, basket work, and guitars; Crevillente for woven rugs and carpets; Jijona for turrón; Ibi for toys.<n>In general, look for good prices at hypermarkets outside the major towns.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Bars and Cafés<n>Banish the bars and cafés and you’d disconcert the whole of Spain. These establishments are at the centre of the country’s social life: where workers take an early morning drink and businessmen negotiate; where old men play cards and friends meet to watch the world go by from shaded pavement tables. Traditionally, a drink buys a seat for as long as you want to stay. In areas popular with tourists, though, you might find the waiter hovering.<n>Bars are graded from first to third class and charge accordingly; prices always include service, but a small 5 percent tip is usual. You will pay up to 15 percent more for service at a table, especially in tourist centres.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Try to visit a bodega, one of the large wine cellars to be found in towns and most villages. Wine matured in the enormous, dark barrels that line the walls of the older bodegas is not much more expensive than vino corriente (ordinary wine) from a modern, million-litre vat. Sample before buying, especially the cheaper wines. They cost less than some mineral waters and will be blended to your taste; containers are extra. Sherry (jerez), a wine fortified with brandy, has been made in Spain for hundreds of years. By the early 18th century, Spain was already exporting it to France. It’s hardly surprising, then, that only Spanish sherry can carry the name unlinked with a country of origin. You will find all the world-famous names on the Costa Blanca, all at reasonable prices. If you are baffled by the choice, remember the main types and experiment.<n>Finos are dry and pale, with a rich bouquet. They are usually taken as aperitifs, particularly manzanillas, the driest of all, and amontillados. Olorosos (which include the brown and cream varieties) are sweet, heavy, and dark, and go well with dessert. Somewhere between the two are the amorosos. These are medium dry, light amber in colour, and can be ordered for an aperitif or as a dessert wine. Most can be bought from the barrel, blended to your own taste.<n>Spanish champagne (Cava) is mass-produced and reasonably priced but almost always sweet. For a dry drink, look for the description brut. Seco (dry) never really is, and dulce is very sweet.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Spanish champagne (Cava) is mass-produced and reasonably priced but almost always sweet. For a dry drink, look for the description brut. Seco (dry) never really is, and dulce is very sweet.<n>There are other sparkling wines, vinos espumosos, which, slightly chilled, go down well on a hot day. Spanish brandy is a bit heavy and sweet and bears little resemblance to the best French cognacs, but it is a good, reasonably priced drink. The more expensive varieties are smoother.<n>Liqueurs abound. Many famous foreign brands (especially French) are made under licence and sell at prices way below those in their home countries. A glance along the shelves of any bar shows the vast range of Spanish liqueurs. They are mostly sweet and often herbal. Try Alicante’s Cantueso, made since 1867 and still unknown outside the province.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
Walk west from Lion Square along the pedestrian street of Dhedhálou (Odós Dhedhálou) to reach the major attraction in the city — the Archaeological Museum. From Dhedhálou run a number of small alleys with up-market cafés and restaurants where you’ll find Iráklion’s young and affluent enjoying iced coffee and a game of backgammon. There are some good restaurants here serving fine Greek and international cuisine.<n>The Archaeological Museum of Iráklion is without a doubt one of the greatest archaeological collections in the world. It brings together finds from sites all across the island and from every era of Crete’s long ancient history, shedding light on the everyday activities of its people. Pride of place has to go to the Minoan artifacts. As the pre-eminent center of this ancient people, Crete is the main source of information and excavated remains. The best finds from all Minoan sites are on display here.<n>For most other museums this would be treasure enough, yet in Iráklion there are also impressive Greek and Roman artifacts to enjoy. The museum is a must for those intending to visit the ancient sites, since the objects here add life to the now empty cities and palaces.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Remains under and around the palace show Neolithic settlements, though the first palace was built after 2000 b.c. — later than Knossós and Phaistós — and it revealed no Kamáresware pottery from the Pre-Palatial period like that found at the other palaces. Its design is also simpler with no large halls or fine wall decorations. This first palace was destroyed by the earthquake c1700 b.c. and there are scant remains of it left in the northwest of the site. The new palace centered on an open courtyard with a west wing mainly consisting of magazines (storerooms) and cult rooms. A loggia fronted the square on this wing. In one room of this wing a píthoi was found with a ceremonial dagger inside, alongside this lay a sword decorated with gold and crystal leading scholars to conclude that this was a preparation or contemplation room for the King. Up a nearby flight of stairs is an altar room with the base of its altar table still in situ. Further west a polythron area with paved floor is thought to have been the royal apartments. Hieroglyphic clay tablets and official seals were found here. Just a little way north of the palace site is the chrysólakkas or ‘pit of gold,’ where the ‘golden bee’ pendant was discovered among a greater cache of jewels.<n>Soon after Mália Palace the road turns inland past the town of Neápolis, birthplace of Pétros Phílargos who became Pope Alexander V in 1409. This is the only place on the island were you can try soumáda, a sweet drink made from almonds. Look for the Chapel of Ághios Geórghios Selínaris on your right as you go up through the mountain pass. This shrine to safe passage along the road was once set high above the old road and was only accessible up a narrow rocky path. Today it stands beside the new fast road and its prayers are perhaps most needed by those trying to cross from the opposite side to visit it.<n>Eventually the road meets the coast at Ágios Nikólaos, probably the prettiest town in eastern Crete. Though Ágios Nikólaos — known to everyone as Ag. Nik — suffered from a sudden rush of ugly building in the 1970s and has a young and noisy crowd, it has made a concerted effort to keep its character and offers a more Greek atmosphere than the Mália/Hersónissos strip.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Crete-WhereToGo.txt
Overlooking the grove’s lily pond is an exact replica of the famous bust of the Dama de Elche (The Lady of Elche). The original, dating from 500 b.c. and now housed in Madrid’s Archaeological Museum, remains something of a puzzle almost a hundred years after it came to light. If you cover that exotic headdress, you’ll see why attributions are difficult to make: The face could be male or female, Spanish, Greek, or Eastern.<n>To visit the place where the bust was discovered, go to the nearby hamlet of La Alcudia. Be sure to see the exhibits of Iberian and Roman finds displayed in the excellent local museum. On the way, you’ll see palms that look rather like giant asparagus tips. Encapuchadores bind these male trees in spring to produce the pale, bleached fronds that are used in Palm Sunday celebrations. These branches, once suitably blessed, are said to conduct lightning, and you’ll see them attached to houses all over Spain. The female palms make a less esoteric annual contribution of 10,000 tons of dates, which ripen in December and are prized for their juicy sweetness.<n>Back in Elche, there are more palm trees to see and more luxuriant tropical foliage to admire. You can dine and dance in the frond-slatted shade of the Parque Municipal, which also features citrus trees and a noisy frog pond. Or visit the Hort de Baix and the Hort del Chocolater (the latter open at irregular intervals) — these groves help make Elche one of the most verdant cities in Europe.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_CstaBlanca-WhereToGo.txt
Live Music Performances<n>Cubans crave live music, and — with the surge in international popularity of traditional Cuban music — so do most visitors to Cuba. You certainly won’t have to go out of your way to hear music performances. Roving groups of musicians can be found playing everywhere from airports to restaurants. Merely wandering the streets of Havana, Santiago, or Trinidad, you’re likely to stumble across a party with a live band, or even a back alley where some impromptu jamming is going on. On Saturday nights in Camagüey, the music spreads to the streets in a “Noche Camagüeya” block party along Calle República.<n>All the styles of Cuba’s delectable traditional music �� habaneras, son, boleros, guarachas, guajiras, and more — can be heard in every town’s casa de la trova, usually a fine old building on or near the main square. Performances are amateur and professional, take place afternoons and evenings, and are free or have a minimal cover charge (US$1–$2). Especially in the evenings and on weekends, when you’ll encounter a vibrant mix of Cubans and foreigners, the island’s casas de la trova really swing. The most famous is in Santiago de Cuba (which has sprung many a star), while those in towns like Trinidad, Baracoa, and Camagüey are especially charming.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhatToDo.txt
The two main islands in the Archipiélago de los Canarreos, south of western Cuba, could not be more different. Cayo Largo is a tourist enclave where visitors are never more than a few yards from sugar-white sands. Yet it’s an antiseptic place, devoid of any Cubans except those who work there. By contrast, the Isle of Youth sees virtually no tourists except those at the rather isolated Hotel El Colony (on the small island’s southwestern tip), who come exclusively for the superb diving at a nearby beach.<n>Cayo Largo, an island 25 km (15.5 miles) long and the most easterly of the Archipiélago de los Canarreos, might be your Caribbean paradise — if all you’re looking for is a dazzling white beach and clear blue seas. Other than the miles of beaches, there’s not much else of consequence here except mangrove, scrub, and half a dozen comfortable hotels with a full program of entertainment and watersports. Turtles nest in the sand at one end of the island. At the other you can go sailing, diving, or deep-sea fishing or take a boat trip to Playa Sirena, an incomparable strip of sand a 10-minute boat ride away, where lobster lunches are available. Cayo Largo, with its captive tourist audience, is considerably more expensive than the mainland.<n>Some package tourists spend the whole of their holiday on Cayo Largo. Those with low boredom thresholds might consider coming for only a daytrip or for overnight trips on half-hour flights from Havana and Varadero.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
A dashing equine statue of Agramonte forms the centerpiece of Parque Agramonte, just to the south. The cathedral occupies one side of the park, and the Casa de la Trova (see page 82), around a floral patio, features musical performances afternoon and evening.<n>A ten-minute walk west down Calle Cristo brings you to a dignified 18th-century church, Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje (Christ of Good Travels), perfectly named for out-of-town visitors. Behind the church is a great sea of crosses and marble saints in a picturesque cemetery; church officials claim it is wholly unrelated to travels that didn’t go so well. A few blocks north, the Convento de Nuestra Señora del Carmen (from the early 19th century) was in a disastrous state in early 2000, though workers were busily rebuilding it. Just enough of the structure remains to make plain that it would be stunning if carefully restored.<n>Camagüey’s finest feature — and marvelously restored — is Plaza San Juan de Dios, an angular old cobblestoned square surrounded by brightly hued, single-story buildings dating from the 18th century plus a lovely yellow church alongside a restored former hospital. It’s one of Cuba’s most beautiful plazas. A few blocks south, near the river, is an impressive agricultural market open every day and stocked with a surprising surfeit of meat and produce.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
In 1846, during the course of an unsavory palace intrigue involving an unsolved murder, meddling by the queen, and the massacre of some 100 high-ranking court figures who had been lured to a palace courtyard, the instigator of these events became the power behind the throne. He was an ambitious and unscrupulous 29-year-old named Jung Bahadur Rana. Before long he had exiled the king, replaced him with the youthful crown prince, and arranged to have himself and his family made hereditary prime ministers.<n>The Ranas were the rulers of Nepal for 104 years. The Shah kings remained, but had only ceremonial power. The Ranas kept the country completely insulated from the outside world; foreigners weren’t allowed in and few Nepalis could go out. Calling themselves Maharajahs, the prime ministers and their relatives built dozens of palaces in Kathmandu, usually in an incongruous neoclassical style. The huge white Singha Durbar palace of the prime minister had 1,700 rooms, far more than the king’s. Reconstructed after a fire in 1973, it serves today as the government secretariat and meeting place of parliament.<n>The Ranas also made a few modern improvements, such as water and power works for the capital, a 50-km (29-mile) narrow-gauge railway in the Terai, a hospital, and a museum. There were not many driveable roads, however, so the Ranas’ new Rolls-Royces were brought to Kathmandu in pieces, either on frames carried by big teams of porters or on the ropeway, a lift that carried freight from Hetauda in the Terai over the Mahabharat range. Outside the valley, Nepal slumbered on, for all intents and purposes still in the Middle Ages.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-History.txt
October and November are the most popular trekking months because they are warm and sunny, and the trails are dry after the monsoon. December is good for low-level treks, though it will be getting cold at higher altitudes. The winter months bring the clearest skies. Spring comes in March and April, when rhododendrons and other flowers set the forests ablaze with color. In spring the skies gradually become hazy and there are light rains, which can make flights to starting points unpredictable. By May it is hot in Pokhara, the high peaks are rarely visible, and humidity mounts until the weather breaks in June, with the onset of the monsoon. Trails during the monsoon are muddy, slippery, and leech-ridden, which makes trekking between June and October a miserable experience. It is possible to fly to higher elevations where leeches are less of a problem, but the rainclouds make mountain flights particularly dangerous.<n>Deciding where to go will depend on the time available and your physical condition. Serious trekkers usually plan on spending two to three weeks or more on the trail. Five days to a week is about the minimum to have a fair sampling of trekking life (though only after about a week do you get your “trail legs”). Shorter outings around the Kathmandu Valley or the four-day “Royal Trek’’ out of Pokhara (which was followed by Prince Charles) afford great mountain views in season and are not to be disdained.<n>Once your route is decided, you’ll need to get a national park or conservation area permit (depending on where you are trekking). These are obtainable at special offices in both Kathmandu and Pokhara (or, for an additional charge, through Kathmandu or Pokhara trekking companies).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
On the Trail<n>Trekking isn’t mountain climbing, but it also isn’t just a stroll in the park. It’s walking, with lots of uphills and downhills. Almost anyone can go trekking, though a trek is definitely more enjoyable if you’re reasonably fit. Sure there are lots of athletes on the trail who seem to be here merely for the challenge, but you’ll also come across groups of the less physically fit, including school groups from the international school in Kathmandu and organized senior citizens’ treks, going happily along at their own pace.<n>As you hike, whether with a fully loaded backpack or just a light daypack, you can’t help marveling at the burdens that porters carry in their dokos (baskets). Everything not made or grown in the villages has to he packed in on the backs of wiry, barefoot porters, who carry loads of as much as 60 kg (130 pounds). Even more amazing is the fact that these baskets have no shoulder straps but only tump lines (forehead straps). You may notice that going downhill, porters take short steps on the balls of their feet with their knees bent. Do the same and you’ll avoid the common complaint of “trekker’s knee.”<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
Trekking Tips<n>Good hiking boots are the most important equipment for trekkers. Although some people trek in running shoes and even flip-flops (and Nepali porters go barefoot), it is advisable to wear sturdy hiking boots with lug soles and especially solid ankle support. A second pair of athletic shoes or river sandals can be packed for changing into at day’s end. A light pair of sock liners covered by heavier woolen socks or a pair of high-tech sweat-wicking sports socks make for comfort going up- and downhill. Be sure to have a roll of moleskin or adhesive plaster to put on your heels or other friction spots before blisters form, and to make a cushioned pad around any blister. Tight pants, such as blue jeans, can make for very uncomfortable climbing. Looser pants, shorts, or, for women, a calf-length loose skirt (such skirts are widely sold in Kathmandu and Pokhara) are recommended. You’ll also need extra socks (keep a dry pair separate for putting on at the end of the day), a couple of changes of pants and shirts, a wool sweater or synthetic fleece jacket, and a down jacket.<n>Take a flashlight (torch), binoculars, sun hat and sunscreen, sunglasses, water bottle, and pocket knife. In your backpack carry a first-aid kit with disinfectant, gauze pads and adhesive tape, elastic bandage (Ace Bandage) for sprains, insect repellent, tincture of iodine to sterilize water (four drops to a liter), throat lozenges, aspirin, a small pair of scissors, safety pins, and a thermometer. Get your doctor to prescribe a treatment for diarrhea and a wide-spectrum antibiotic. You may be many days from the nearest medical care and will have to doctor yourself and possibly others.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt
You can photograph the head-chopping in the Kot Courtyard off the Durbar Square, where goats and bullocks are sacrificed for army units all morning long, as well as in the shops in the palace wall facing the temples in the square. Burly young soldiers are expected to dispatch the animals with a single stroke of the heavy khora sword, as the big drum thumps and martial music is played before the massed flags of Nepali regiments. The Kot Courtyard, incidentally, is where the first Rana engineered the massacre of a hundred nobles, clearing the path to power in 1846.<n>On the tenth day of Dasain family members exchange visits and feast. Visits to work supervisors are also obligatory. Government functionaries, in their uniform of white leggings and black jacket and cap, go to the palace to receive the tika from the king. Thousands of ordinary people also line the streets around the palace, waiting hours to receive the king’s blessing.<n>There is still a celebratory feeling in the air two weeks later, when Tihar, also called Deepawali, is celebrated. This festival of lights honors Lakshmi, goddess of wealth. The story is that in the dark nights of the autumn new moon, Lakshmi orbits the earth aboard her owl. She will reward with prosperity those houses below that have been made tidy and show lights burning on the doorstep. This is a time for non-stop gambling games, often held on a street-corner or in a temple compound, with all players hoping for Lakshmi’s favor. Shops and homes mark a red path from the sidewalk or road, through their doors, to the building’s money-box. Small clay oil lamps are also set out to welcome the goddess. Elsewhere, strings of electric lights blaze all night during the five-day festival, and groups of youngsters go from house to house singing songs and receiving gifts. All sorts of tinsel garlands, fancy lamps, fireworks, and decorations are sold in the street.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhatToDo.txt

Although they are so close to Kathmandu as almost to be suburbs, the sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur each have a distinct character and unique attractions. For 300 years, until forcibly united in the late 18th century, they were separate kingdoms with related, but not always friendly, Malla rulers.<n>Within and beyond the valley are many more sights worth taking in on day trips, including viewpoints on the valley’s rim from where you can see the Himalayas at sunrise and sunset, particularly recommended if you are not planning to go trekking.<n>For many visitors, trekking is the main purpose of a trip to Nepal. The special section on trekking gives hints and tips on what to expect, what to take along, the dangers to avoid, and a brief description of the more popular treks (see page 75).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
The alleys of Patan lead to a succession of half-hidden temples and shrines of great beauty and interest. One of the most impressive of these is the Mahaboudha, or Temple of the Thousand Buddhas, which was erected in the 16th century. Designed after the temple at Bodh Gaya in India where Buddha reached enlightenment, this soaring spire boasts an image of Buddha on each one of its bricks. Extensively damaged during the 1934 earthquake, it was later reconstructed.<n>The road from Kathmandu to Patan passes an Ashoka stupa (one of four in Patan) and brings you to Jawalakhel and the Tibetan Cooperative. Founded in 1960 with Swiss assistance for Tibetan refugees, this center makes and sells carpets. In surrounding buildings the process of carding, washing, spinning, and dyeing the wool, then weaving the carpets, can be followed from start to finish. Quality of carpets is judged by the number of knots per square inch: 60, 80, or (superlative) 100. Profits of the cooperative go to support schools and help handicapped and aged Tibetan refugees.<n>At the nearby Patan Industrial Estate, Newari craftsmen can be watched carving windows and door frames for reconstruction projects or boxes for the tourist trade. They use the same tools and methods as their ancestors, and demonstrate the same skills. So do the bronze-workers, who cast figurines by the ancient “lost wax” method. These artisans are not faking antiques; they are continuing traditions.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
Along the park boundary and especially at Sauraha near park headquarters, dozens of lodges and inexpensive guest houses cater to budget-minded tourists. Elephant rides, jeep tours, and canoe trips can all be arranged at the park entrance, where an interesting interpretive center provides a history of the area and information about its ecology. One is reminded that in 1938, during a safari arranged for the British Viceroy of India, hundreds of elephants took part in a hunt that bagged 120 tigers, 38 rhinos, and 27 leopards. Today, hundreds of soldiers are stationed in the park to keep out poachers.<n>Package tours, with two or three nights in or near the park, are widely offered by travel agencies in Kathmandu. You can fly to an airstrip near the park in half an hour, go by car or tourist bus in about six hours, or spend a day or two paddling the rapids of the Trisuli River en route.<n>Travel by road provides a glimpse of the Terai, an extension of the Ganges Plain. This well-watered farming zone stretches the length of the country on its southern border with India. It’s only about 40 km (25 miles) wide, but a third of Nepal’s population lives here, producing much of the nation’s food.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Nepal-WhereToGo.txt
The cinema is a great national passion, with over 300 different films showing in Paris every week. For undubbed versions with French subtitles, look out for the letters VO (version originale) in listings or posters. Cinemas on the Champs-Elysées, in Montparnasse, St-Germain-des-Prés, Bastille, and the Forum des Halles all show VO movies.<n>Keeping up with the latest in discos and clubs can be a full-time job for professional night-owls: there’s no point in turning up before midnight. Many are nominally private, which means you only get in if the doormen like the way you look. Some expensive, exclusive examples hide out around the Champs-Elysées, such as Régine’s in the rue de Ponthieu. Louder, less expensive, younger, and weirder places come and go around Bastille and Oberkampf. There’s still some life in St-Germain-des-Prés and the Latin Quarter, especially in university term time — making local friends is the best way to find it.<n>Pop and rock concerts are held at the spectacular Zénith in the Parc de la Villette (métro: Porte de Pantin), at Parc-des-Princes (métro: Porte de St-Cloud), and also the Palais Omnisport de Bercy (métro: Bercy). Ticket offices (billeteries) at FNAC or Virgin Megastore, both on the Champs-Elysées, will show what groups are in town.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhatToDo.txt
The French take their jazz seriously, and Paris has many jazz clubs. Hot Brass (La Villette) and The New Morning (rue des Petites-Ecuries) attract big American and European musicians, while Le Dunois (rue Dunois) is an intimate place, cultivating more avant-garde music. The Lionel Hampton club at the Méridien Etoile (Porte Maillot) has a full program of guest performers. The old-established Caveau de la Huchette (rue de la Huchette in St-Germain-des-Prés) opens every night at 9:30pm for listening and dancing to a small combo or big band swing or bebop. Entrance prices of around 60–120F may include your first drink; extra drinks cost 30–60F.<n>In the realm of classical music, Paris has come back into its own, with many fine concerts at Salle Pleyel and Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, opera at the new Opéra-Bastille, and the ballet at the Opéra-Garnier. In all cases, some seats are reasonably priced, though they tend to go quickly. Look out for free concerts in churches.<n>Modern dance is enjoying a revival, with a new wave of small, imaginative companies beginning modestly enough at the Café de la Danse (passage Louis-Philippe) and Théâtre Garnier before reaching the heights of the Théâtre de la Bastille.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhatToDo.txt
Take time off from the city bustle for a stroll through the Jardin des Tuileries, named after a 13th-century tile works and now beautifully re-landscaped as part of a renovation plan for the Musée du Louvre to the east. Walk around the chestnut and lime trees, and admire Aristide Maillol’s 18 sensual statues of nymphs and languorous maidens, a few of which are coquettishly half concealed behind a miniature maze.<n>The gardens’ 28 hectares (11 acres) extend across the site of the royal Palais des Tuileries, burnt down during the 1871 Commune (see page 21). A few fragments of the palace can be seen by the Jeu de Paume exhibition building in the northwest corner. Children can enjoy donkey rides, puppet shows in spring and summer, and model boats on the circular ponds. Adults go for the giant Ferris wheel installed at the holiday season.<n>In the corner near the Seine, facing place de la Concorde, the Orangerie is known for its two oval rooms with Monet’s beautiful Nymphéas (Water Lilies) murals, but see, too, the fine collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings upstairs (see page 71).<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
The Sorbonne<n>Named after the 13th-century college established by Robert de Sorbon for poor theological students, the university was later taken in hand by Cardinal Richelieu, who financed its reconstruction (1624–1642). Few of the somewhat forbidding buildings are open to the public, but you can go inside the 17th-century courtyard with its ornate sundial and see the outside of the Baroque library and domed church. Protest against overcrowding, antiquated teaching, bureaucracy, and the very basis of the social system made the Sorbonne a focal point for unrest in 1968, a year of ferment throughout Europe. Over on the quiet, tree-shaded place de la Sorbonne, it’s hard to imagine the police invading such a peaceful sanctuary — one that for centuries guaranteed student immunity. But invade they did, and revolt exploded onto the streets. Students and workers made common cause, and there followed widespread national strikes that threatened the survival of the government. In the aftermath of the revolts, the Sorbonne was absorbed into the huge Paris Universities monolith and lost its independence.<n>Standing virtually opposite the Sorbonne’s rue des Ecoles entrance, at 6 place Paul-Painlevé, are the massive brick ruins of the ancient Roman public baths. They survived as part of an abbey — now the Musée National du Moyen Age, still often called by its former name, Musée de Cluny (see page 72). Its most famous exhibits are the wonderful 15th-century tapestries, including the Lady with the Unicorn.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Paris-WhereToGo.txt
Claude Monet’s glorious floral and water gardens are much more attractive than the rather artificially restored house.

The house is open April–October, Tuesday–Sunday 10am–noon, 2–6pm, the gardens all year Tuesday–Sunday 10am–6pm; closed Monday.

SHOPPING<n>The demise of Communism in 1989 and the move to a free-market economy have had a dramatic impact on Poland as a shopping destination. Drab state-owned stores are a thing of the past. The dollar and mark (and other currencies) don’t go as far today as they once did, but foreign visitors and their Polish counterparts can only be pleased with the opening of trade and vastly improved selection of goods on the market. In major cities like Warsaw and Kraków, Poland doesn’t lag far behind Western Europe and North America for commercial opportunities. Even with the end of Communism and inflation, Poland remains considerably cheaper than Western European destinations.<n>Where to Shop<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Poland-WhatToDo.txt
Poland’s development of a market economy has produced a proliferation of stores and boutiques, including many imported from Western Europe and North America. You can now buy most Western goods in large and modern department stores, specialty shops, and market stalls.<n>For folk art and other handicrafts, start at branches of Cepelia stores, a chain of folk art and souvenir shops in large cities. (Occasionally, they go by different names, even though locals invariably call them Cepelia.) For antiques, the dominant player is the Desa chain (though there are many smaller, independent dealers as well). In Kraków and Warsaw, there are numerous branches, all with different stock, so it pays to visit a few if you’re looking for a particular item. There are essentially three places in the country for Polish poster art: in Kraków, Galeria Plakatu Kraków (ul. Stolarska 8-10); and in Warsaw, Galeria Plakatu (ul. Hoza 40) and the Poster Museum (Muzeum Plakatu) at Wilanów Palace.<n>Specialty shopping markets and unique venues exist in several cities. These include the famous, long-standing Cloth Hall stalls, loaded with crafts and amber jewelry, in Kraków; Warsaw’s swank, boutique-lined ul. Nowy •wiat; and ul. Mariacka in Gdansk’s Main town for amber jewelry. Open-air markets and bazaars include: in Warsaw, Dziesieciolecia stadium in Praga, across the river (actually held in a stadium) and Kolo Bazaar, in Wola; in Kraków, the traders’ market between the train station and the Barbican; and in Gdansk, Kupcy Dominikanscy (on Pl.

The habitats of some 4000 animals, including Siberian tigers, kangaroos, cheetahs, crocs, snow leopards, and an unusual red panda are spread across 40 hectares (99 acres). The zoo also has a free-flight bird hall. Another option in the capital for small children is the Baj Puppet Theater (ul. Jagiellonska 28, Tel. 818 08 21) housed in a former Jewish school in Praga, across the river from Old Town. Playgrounds — the kind with tunnels, jungle gyms, and inflatable cages filled with rubber balls — are found in the capital: Stratosfera (ul. Ostrobramska 75c, Tel. 611 35 83); Kolorado Ursynów (ul. Herbsta 4, Tel. 664 88 77).<n>For kids with energy to burn, there are water parks and swimming pools (see above) in summer and ice rinks in winter. To go ice skating, check out the Stegny Skating Track (Tor Lyzwiarski Stegny), (ul. Inspektowa 1, Tel. 842 27 68) or Torwar (ul. Lazienkowska, Tel. 621 44 71) in Warsaw. Another activity that is all the rage is paintball, and there are multiple fields where you can inflict paint rather than pain. Try Marcus-Graf (ul. Widok 10, in Beniaminów near Warsaw; Tel. 816 10 08), TM Pretor (ul. Zaaruskiego 6, Warsaw; Tel. 838 25 35), Rival Paintball Guns (ul. Bartosika 10/77, Warsaw; Tel. 671 22 63), or Extreme Sports (ul. Klaudyny 18/5, Warsaw; Tel. 833 73 73). Paintballers in Kraków should check out Ultimate Sports (near fort Bodzanów; Tel. 431 20 61).<n>Another fast-paced sport is go-karts. In Warsaw, race the kids over to Imola, where they also feature paintball (ul. Pulawska 33, Piaseczno; Tel. 648 27 14). If your kids like bowling, you’ll find facilities in all the major cities. One place they’re sure to like in Kraków is Atomic World Entertainment Center (ul. Zakopianska 62; Tel. 261 31 14), which not only has swanky lanes but loads of video games, billiards, and air hockey. In the Malta lake district of Poznan, there are many facilities ideal for children, including a manmade ski slope and a exhilerating toboggan run.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Poland-WhatToDo.txt
Other Live Music and Performing Arts. Lisbon is home to the greatest number of opera, ballet, and classical concerts (including the Gulbenkian Symphony). Lisbon’s cultural scene offers occasional opera, symphony concerts, ballet, and recitals, usually held in winter. The city’s opera company is highly regarded by the rest of the world, and the Gulbenkian Foundation (see page 33) maintains its own symphony orchestra and ballet company. Porto (selected European City of Culture for 2001) is certainly on the upswing, featuring a wide spate of concerts and theater that will likely improve the city’s offerings on a permanent basis.<n>Nightclubs. Lisbon and Porto are both packed with dance clubs and bars that go late into the night, and popular Algarve resorts such as Albufeira and Praia da Rocha throb to a disco beat. Most other towns in Portugal, while offering a reduced roster of low-key bars, tend to be rather quiet at night.<n>Gambling. Near Lisbon, the Estoril Casino is one of the biggest draws for gamblers. Casinos are also found in the Algarve at Monte Gordo, Vilamoura, and Praia da Rocha, as well as at Figuera da Foz, Espinho, and Póvoa de Varzim. Popular games are baccarat, craps, roulette, blackjack, and slot machines. To be admitted, you must be over 21 and carry a passport.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhatToDo.txt
Perched on the edge of the Bairro Alto is one of Lisbon’s most evocative sights, the shell of the 14th-century Igreja do Carmo, which was packed with worshippers on All Saints’ Day, 1755, when the terrible earthquake brought the roof down. The church remains deliberately preserved as an atmospheric ruin. Nearby, the sumptuous 16th-century Igreja de São Roque features a lavish baroque chapel of São João Baptista (St. John the Baptist) and a small museum of sacred art.<n>You can easily walk to the Bairro Alto from the central squares in the Baixa, but it’s also fun to go by tram or board the landmark 30-m (98-ft) Elevador de Santa Justa, which you’ll find just off Rossio square. The stately elevator, a 1902 Victorian marvel of iron and glass, was built by Raul Mesnier (not Gustave Eiffel, as many continue to believe). The longer, slower route back downhill meanders through the elegant shopping area of Chiado, now totally rebuilt after a drastic 1988 fire that swept through the district.<n>Some 6 km (4 miles) west of Praça do Comércio along the river lies the riverside district of Belém. Many of the great voyages of discovery set out from here in the 15th and 16th centuries. The new sea routes produced a golden age of commerce, and King Manuel built two magnificent monuments to commemorate the country’s achievements.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
Follow Calle Beneficencia, the street leading off the right side of the barracks, back towards town. You’ll soon come to a small square on your left with a huge totemic sculpture. This is Plaza del Quinto Centenario (Quincentenary Square). The sculpture symbolizes the 500 years of Puerto Rico’s existence. On close inspection, Amerindian and Spanish themes can be seen, but some elements are a little obscure.<n>Walk on to reach another small square, Plaza San José (San José Square), one of the gems of the city. Situated close to El Morro, it was once one of the most important squares in San Juan. In the center is a statue of Juan Ponce de León in full regalia that was cast in 1797 from the iron of a British cannon, confiscated after their unsuccessful attack on the city. Edged by historic buildings, the square has changed little since the 17th century, except that many of the houses have been converted to restaurants and bars. This is a good place to come after dark and watch the world go by.<n>On the north flank of the square is the Spanish Gothic Iglesia San José (San José Church), the second-oldest church in the New World. The plain white façade reflects the sunlight, helping cool the interior. The body of Ponce de León was interred here for over 300 years before being moved to the San Juan Cathedral in 1908. Attached to the church is a large building that was originally a Dominican Convent. It was an army barracks until 1966, when it was taken under the auspices of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. You can enter the main square and see the three cloistered floors that flank it. Art exhibitions are held here regularly.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Near the ferry dock, across Calle Marina, you’ll see the rising edifice of the San Juan Post Office, a magnificent building with Art-Deco features. In front of the post office is a tiny tourist information office, La Casita, where you can pick up maps and information.<n>Continue past the Post Office and the adjoining Plaza de Hostos, which is full of souvenir stalls (and faux designer watches galore). To the left is the Arsenal de la Marina, a fine building with strange Moorish details. Built in 1800, it houses the Fine Arts and Folk Arts departments of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. In front of you is the Paseo de la Princessa, a smart promenade that has emerged from years of neglect to become the place in town to stroll in the evening, or to sit and watch the world go by. A number of new statues and fountains now grace the Paseo. One, named Raices (Roots), depicts members of each of the races that have contributed to the modern Puerto Rican mix, surrounded by playful dolphins. La Princessa, home of the offices of the Puerto Rico Tourist Company, sits along the Paseo. Originally a prison — this is why it is outside the city walls — it is now a showcase of modern Puerto Rican art.<n>Metropolitan San Juan<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
South of the historic town center, on Avenue of the Americas (a modern two-lane highway) is the Museo de Arte de Ponce (Ponce Art Museum). This collection of European and Puerto Rican art, probably the finest in the Caribbean, would be very much at home in any European capital. The museum is the brainchild of Luis Ferré, industrialist and onetime governor of Puerto Rico, who has put great effort into bringing works of art to the town. More than 1,600 paintings and sculptures make up the collection, which covers five centuries of western art. The Flemish collection features work by Paul Bril (1554–1626) and David Teniers (1610–1690). The Spanish collection has a piece by El Greco (1541–1614). Nicholas Maes (1632–1693) is represented in the Dutch collection, and British artists include Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), Thomas Gainsborough (1727–1788) and George Romney (1734–1802). Pride of place is taken by the painting Flaming June, by Frederick Lord Leighton (1830–1896). The gallery offers a guided tour in English every afternoon at 2pm.<n>The city of Ponce actually sits some 3 miles (5 km) inland, but the local residents take every opportunity to go to the coast. The city beach is kept passably tidy by litter patrols. One spot where you’re bound to meet the locals is La Guancha, a boardwalk area between the beach, Ponce Marina, and the commercial docks. It’s a great place for strolling and gazing out over the water. There’s a tower to climb if you want a bird’s-eye view. Numerous kiosks sell cold beer and Puerto Rican snacks. The area’s always buzzing at weekends.<n>While at La Guancha you may see groups of people across the narrow bay staring down into the water. More likely than not, they’re trying to catch sight of the giant tarpon that have taken to swimming around in the shallows. Hundreds of these fish — some are up to 7 ft (2 m) long — congregate here because they’ve learned they’ll be well supplied with tasty tidbits offered by the humans on shore.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Magens Bay is a beautiful stretch of sand with a slight kink in the center, which gives it the epithet “heart-shaped.” Because it is so sheltered, it’s a safe place for children to swim and for everyone to snorkel, though it can get very busy. In the rolling hillside behind the beach is Mahogany Run Golf Course, so you could have a round in the morning and swim and snorkel in the afternoon.<n>On the eastern end of the island, amid a number of large hotel complexes, is Coki Point, a pleasant beach. At the end of the point is Coral World, which offers a fascinating look at life under the water. The attraction centers around a number of different controlled marine environments, each with its own animals or fish. Watch out for the sting-ray, shark, and turtle pools, where regular feeding times are posted; you’ll even get a chance to pet some of the exhibits. Pride of place at Coral World must go to the genuine coral reef, which has been implanted in the open water offshore. An underground viewing area reached via a walkway allows you to observe the daily activity of the reef fish and some of the larger wild creatures who swim in for the free food provided by Coral World staff.<n>Coki Beach is popular spot for snorkelers, simply because there is so much sea-life here, thanks to the regular feedings provided by Coral World around their reef. Many of the cruise ships bus their passengers in here for snorkeling so it can get busy, but you are almost always guaranteed a good show of marine life.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt
Eco- and adventure-tourism fans will feel they’ve reached nirvana here. With an increasing number of tourists looking for these options, the Mexican Association of Adventure Travel and Eco-tourism (AMTAVE; Tel. (5) 663-5381, or www.amtave.com.mx) was formed to offer information about the most qualified guides and authentic service providers in each area of Mexico, and can direct you to qualified members in the area.<n>A word for those enamored of hiking: As a rule, in Mexico there are no marked trails or ranger stations such as you commonly find in the US and Europe. Therefore, it is better to go with a local operator or qualified guide, or contact a company in the US or Europe that can arrange something that fits your ability and sense of adventure. The Sierra Madre Mountains adjacent to Puerto Vallarta offer challenging, yet accessible hiking and mountain biking. Bike-Mex (Tel. (3) 223-1834) offers expert guided tours into the mountains and other outlying areas as well as mountain biking expeditions to challenge every rider’s skill level.<n>Whether along a deserted stretch of beach, or in the foothills of tropical mountains, horseback riding is an excellent way to enjoy the exquisite landscapes of Pacific Mexico. Tour operators and travel agencies in all the destinations listed in this guide can arrange horseback tours, or you may even be approached by independent operators while you sunbathe at the beach. In Puerto Vallarta you will find some of the finer ranches with well-cared for horses (the ones at the beaches are apt to be scrawny). These ranches offer daytime or sunset rides into the Sierra Madre mountains for both experienced and inexperienced riders. One particularly outstanding operation is Rancho Palma Real, which offers a long four- to six-hour ride into the fertile valley that extends from the foothills of the Sierra Madre, along a river and up to an absolutely beautiful waterfall.<n>	#travel_guides#	travel_guides_berlitz2_Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt
