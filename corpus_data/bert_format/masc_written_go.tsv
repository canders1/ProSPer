ect there are no references to that section. Although the C♯ major chord in measure 293, preceded by A♭ major (V) in measure 285, suggests C♯ as tonal center, the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303. [SEP] The arrival at C♯ was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development (Example 15), which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C♯. [SEP] Because of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to B in the second theme group, we could conceive of C[SEP] as a sub-dominant in this movement.

Strange things have always happened to my family. [SEP] It came in through my mother's blood; my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories, bylichkas, of ancestors with the "second sight", stupid mill owners who discovered bags of	go	ld after letting a special fish off their hooks, and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times. [SEP] When I asked her if she'd ever seen them – before I was old enough to stop believing, I mean – she would always look sad and tell me, "No, not since the family came to America has anything happened to us. But if you ever should see a faerie, tell him that you are of the blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly."

“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,” said my driver. [SEP] I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills. [SEP] “We interact with humans, take advantage of them, grant them boons, sometimes even become their friends, but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction. At this point, we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional. “The only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours. Love-ins, raves, gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion: that is where entities from this world tend to	go	when they cross over, and that is where Rachel met someone from this world. Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this, where the human population is so overwhelming that they won’t be noticed in the right corner, with the right protective spells.” [SEP] He took out the hunchback’s directions and glanced at an alley behind us.

The vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us. [SEP] In a blink of the strobe light, he was on his feet and dashing from the room. [SEP] “Come on!” shouted Nepthys. [SEP] We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us. [SEP] He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall, and we chased up after him, heading up a huge staircase that seemed to	go	up for more stories than the building could have held. [SEP] Luckily, the vampire turned off after three stories. [SEP] He ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors, but Nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me. I called out to Amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us. [SEP] Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment. [SEP] Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room, then made a turn out of sight. [SEP] When I came to the door at the end of the room, it looked like it had been torn off its hinges. [SEP] I didn’t imagine that Nepthys had done it, and it wasn’t without alarm that I ran after him.	#fiction#	fiction_Nathans_Bylichka.txt	go	written	masc_written	1

Some new information has come to light over the Kursk disaster. [SEP] (For those with short attention spans, the Kursk was the submarine that blew up and sank in the Arctic Ocean killing all 118 on board.) [SEP] The Russians tried to blame the incident on a collision with an unidentified object. [SEP] However, sonar tapes which recorded the blasts (a small one at first, then a much larger one, two minutes later), cast doubt on these claims. [SEP] A whistle-blower within the Russian military has leaked that the crew of the Kursk was testing a new type of torpedo when the accident occurred. [SEP] It seemed very likely that the test didn't	go	quite as planned. [SEP] While rescue efforts to save the survivors of the Kursk failed, salvage crews were able to recover a 'Black Box' from the submarine which recorded events leading up to the explosion. [SEP] As luck would have it, we managed to obtain a copy of those tapes. [SEP] It turns out that the submarine crew was trying to load Microsoft Windows on their fire control computer. [SEP] Their intent was to replace the aging CP/M operating system with the flashier Windows OS. [SEP] Apparently, the Russians didn't know about the legendary stability problems exhibited by Windows. [SEP] The log tapes make this painfully obvious:	#jokes#	jokes_jokes10.txt	go	written	masc_written	1

Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor.

[SEP] Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks. [SEP] You will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135lbs.

nd the bottom fell out of the barrel. [SEP] Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. [SEP] I refer you again to my weight. [SEP] As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side of the building. [SEP] In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. [SEP] This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and lower body. [SEP] Here my luck began to change slightly. [SEP] The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked. [SEP] I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let	go	of the rope and I had to lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me.

EP] Today, Hewlett’s and Terman’s philosophy permeates the region. [SEP] Despite fierce inter-firm competition, open information exchange is common practice among the region’s producers. [SEP] Several features of the Valley contribute to creating a ‘weak’ environment. [SEP] The high pace of technology and product life cycles, fluidity of firm formation and failure, rapid employee turnover resulting in little com-pany-specific socialisation, as well as a lack of meaningful institutionally based hierarchy, all contribute to an environment in which individuals rely on alternative cues to guide their behaviour. [SEP] For example, in the Valley, technology moves quickly and competition is tough. [SEP] New firms form almost overnight -and many disappear just as quickly. [SEP] When firms come and	go	like ships in the night it is not surprising that employees tend to identify with their profession, not their company. [SEP] Moreover, people’s loyalty is not only to their profession, but to the host industry region. [SEP] ‘As one local semiconductor executive reportedly noted: ‘‘Many of us wake up in the morning thinking that we work for Silicon Valley Inc.’’ ’ (Saxenian, 1996, p. 23). [SEP] They view job-changing as the norm. [SEP] Average job tenure is in the area of two years, and annual turnover is around 35%, and often higher for smaller firms (Saxenian, 1996). [SEP] As one engineer explained: ‘two or three years is about the max [at a job] for the Valley because there’s always something more interesting across the street’ (Saxenian, p. 28).

As Jones’s (1996) research affirms, people’s social behaviour reveals that several distinct stages can be observed over the course of a career in the film industry. [SEP] At the ‘beginning’ stage, freelance employees are constantly vying to participate in an industry in which there are no clear rules for entry. [SEP] As one grip/electrician explained: ‘‘‘There’s no tried and true way to get started. You have to find people you like who make movies . . . It’s getting the first job that is the hardest’’’ (Jones, 1996, p. 62). [SEP] Once inside, the worker at the ‘crafting’ stage finds that, ‘You build your reputation every day. You’re only as	go	od as your last job’ (pp. 64–5).
